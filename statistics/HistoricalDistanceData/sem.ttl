<http://abc7chicago.com/news/gage-park-murders-13-year-old-begged-for-life-prosecutors-say/1347513/> dct:description "A judge denied bail for a man and his girlfriend charged in connection with the murder of six family members in their Gage Park home in February.Diego Uribe-Cruz, 22, who is related to the family, and Jafeth Ramos, 19, face six counts of first-degree murder, Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson announced Thursday. The couple was arrested Wednesday night at their Little Village home where they were raising their infant son.Police say both gave recorded confessions. At the bond hearing, the judge said the slaughter of the Martinez family \"can only be described with two words: pure evil.\"Police say Uribe argued with his uncle's ex-wife, Maria Herminia Martinez, before shooting her.Police said Uribe killed 32-year-old Martinez first, during the argument, by shooting her four times in the head. Maria's brother, Noe Martinez Jr., 38, was the second victim. He was beaten when he came to his sister's aid. Police said Uribe then systematically murdered the other four family members: Noe Martinez Sr., 62, who was stabbed more than 40 times; his wife, Rossaura Martinez, 58, and their grandchildren Leonardo Cruz, 13, and Alexis Cruz, 10. All the victims, including the boys, had defensive wounds.After killing Noe Jr., police say Uribe pushed Rossaura Martinez down the stairs, stabbed her, and then stabbed Maria Martinez's two young sons - his cousins. First, he killed 10-year-old Alexis. Uribe told prosecutors he \"...got (him) there with the same knife that I got the grandma.\"According to prosecutors, young victim Leonardo Cruz begged for his life saying, \"Please no! Please don't! I just want to live!\"Alvarez said before he was killed, Ramos made Leonardo hold a bag to help them steal items. Then Uribe told the teen to watch out the window for his grandfather, and killed him. Later, his grandfather returned with tamales and hot chocolate when he was killed.Prosecutors say Noe Sr. questioned Uribe's motive as he was attacked, saying, \"Why are you killing me, I don't owe you anything.\"Uribe and Ramos are boyfriend and girlfriend. Uribe did not have a criminal background. Ramos had one previous misdemeanor arrest.\"Six lives taken for $550 and an Xbox,\" Alvarez said.Police say that during the course of the investigation, they asked family members for DNA samples. Uribe consented to a DNA test, and police say that helped discover that he was a suspect.Investigators said the break in the case came on Wednesday when DNA evidence linked Uribe to the murder scene in the 5700-block of S. California. They also obtained cell phone records that put Uribe in the area at the time of the murders. Police said evidence also revealed Ramos was present with Uribe at the scene.\"He never seemed angry, mad or anything. He just was a typical nice guy,\" said Angie Morales, the suspects' neighbor.Police discovered the grisly scene in a home on Feb. 4 after a relative asked for a well-being check.From the beginning, police described the case as a complex investigation. It was believed that the family had been specifically targeted and that this was not a random crime.Police found the doors of the house locked. There were no signs of forced entry. The home was not ransacked and none of the victims was bound.\"In my 28 years, I haven't seen a case that has hit as close to home for myself and so many others in this department,\" said Supt. Johnson." ;

<http://abc7chicago.com/news/searching-for-answers-what-happened-on-california-ave-/1187462/> dct:description "CHICAGO (WLS) -- After six people were found dead inside a home on Chicago's Southwest Side, the ABC7 I-Team looked into who lived there and why they were murdered - neither of which police have disclosed.The victims are all believed to have been living in the Gage Park house and some of them were related, according to detectives.It is the deadliest single act of violence in Chicago in more than 13 years, but what happened on California Avenue is not answered by any red flags in the public record. The property was in foreclosure as of late last year; owned by a grandfather in his early 60's and his son in his late 30's, according to an attorney who represented them.Despite the foreclosure, the family that lived here had been making payments and was trying to work it out with the bank, according to their attorney. They previously owned other property in the city as well.The older couple and the son were Mexican, described by the lawyer as \"responsible\" and \"nice\". The son worked for an import company on the South Side and has children of his own. They, along with the children's mother, appear to have been living in the home at the time.The Gage Park neighborhood is not known as a high-crime section of the city, and last year was not even in the top 30 for overall crime according to police statistics. These were the first murders in Gage Park this year.The manner of attack was also unusual. According to police statistics, knife murders make up between five and nine percent of the total killings citywide. So far this year, of 63 murders in Chicago, only two involved knives before today.Gage Park is not known as a particularly heavy gang area, although there are three street gangs that have divided up Gage Park and claim it their turf. But there is no indication this was a gang hit according to police, and a knife attack like this certainly wouldn't fit any gang crime pattern.But until police verify the identities of the 12-year-old boy, the woman and four men, much of this story remains a mystery." ;

PAPEETE (AFP) — Gaston Flosse narrowly won another term as president of French Polynesia on Sunday following dizzying political manoeuvering that saw independence supporters throw their support behind the Paris stalwart.
Flosse, 76, who has twice been investigated for corruption, saw his party place third in elections earlier this month, but he pulled out a 29 to 27 victory over Gaston Tong Sang.
Tong Sang, whose party placed first in the election taking 27 seats in the chamber, appeared to have clinched support for his return to the presidency by supporting the election of Flosse's deputy as speaker of the assembly on Thursday.
But Flosse met Saturday with former pro-independence president Oscar Temaru, who withdrew his candidacy on Sunday and threw the support of his 20 lawmakers in the assembly behind Flosse, whose party has 10 deputies.
Flosse now has five days to form a government, which will likely prominently feature independence supporters.
A member of the French Senate of President Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP party since 1998, Flosse has long advocated wide-ranging autonomy for French Polynesia instead of independence.
He served as head of the territory from 1984 to 1987, 1991 to 2004 and then from October 2004 to February 2005.
Flosse was cleared of charges on appeal in one corruption case, while he was put under formal investigation in 2003 for employing fictitious employees although no charges were filed.
France annexed the South Pacific archipelago of 263,000 people in the late 19th century.

 The Barrie tornado is often listed as the "Hopeville to Barrie tornado" describing the path the twister took. In addition to the direct damage done by the tornado, there was significant damage from severe thunderstorms and hail, which knocked out power and damaged 150 farms. Some estimates put the total cost of the disaster at $300 million. In an interview with Barbara Frum following this documentary, reporter Doug James said the most moving thing he noticed in Barrie was the almost compulsive desire by tornado survivors to salvage something from their ruined homes  a photograph, a toy, anything unbroken  that would ground them, and tie their uncertain future with their life before the disaster struck. In this clip we see some of the bizarre scenes that inevitably follow a tornado strike, such as homes with no roof or walls, yet clothes still hanging neatly in an exposed closet. Barrie tornado survivor David Wilson says that after his house was struck, the first thing he noticed was the foreign smell of fresh soil on his basement floor. Dirt had been stripped from farms outside the city, and driven with such force that it permeated even relatively undamaged buildings. The centre of a tornado is a zone of very low pressure. Some people mistakenly believe that the difference in pressure between the funnel and a house can make the house actually explode. In reality, the terrific winds simply blow away roofs, allowing walls to blow down outward. An even more dangerous accompanying myth is that opening your windows will equalize the pressure. Houses are not well sealed, and the air escapes regardless. Going near a window merely puts you in harm's way.""" ;

“We can see attempts of politicizing this situation that stem neither from the Armenian government, nor from Russia. There are many who desire to use this tragedy in order to receive its geopolitical dividends,” Lavrov said at a conference in Moscow emphasizing that Armenian-Russian relations will not suffer because of this situation.
On Wednesday the youngest member of the seven-member Avetisyan family, attacked and killed in Gyumri, six-month-old Seryozha Avetisyan was buried, after a week-long fight for the infant’s life failed. Valeri Permyakov, a 19-year old Russian serviceman stationed in 102nd military base in Gyumri is accused of the crime.
Armenian officials seems to agree with Lavrov, because, even though society mostly demands that the accused be handed to the Armenian jurisdiction, the political officials prefer preserving relations with their military ally.
According to political analyst Sergey Minasyan, deputy director of Caucasus Institute, it is exactly for political, geopolitical and military expediency that the Armenian government does not demand that the investigation be handed over to them, because legally all facts speak for them.
“I do not think that there will be serious changes in Armenian-Russian international relations; besides, new legal practical mechanisms will be formed for the military base in order to prevent such occurrences from repeating in the future,” Minasyan told reporters.
According to the political analyst, Armenia needs good relations with Russia for security reasons, while “if something happens, and that military base is removed from Armenia, Russia will not disappear from the world map”.
Simply, Russia is seen as Armenia’s protector, and the security of the republic cannot be weighed against the tragedy apparently perpetrated by a teenage serviceman whose actions appear driven by his mental state, rather by any nationalistic tendencies.
However, not everyone in Armenia agrees with Minasyan. Political analyst Stepan Danielyan thinks that, for instance, Russia has a lot to lose if the military base were removed from Armenia (as some are calling for, in the wake of the Gyumri murders).
“Russia loses its presence in the Caucasus, its influence on the future Kurdistan, NATO military bases appear in the Caucasus, with that - serious security problems in the South, oil and gas from the Middle East and Azerbaijan flow to Europe, nobody else needs its gas and oil, thus it loses 50 percent of its export, the budget gets empty,” Danielyan wrote on his Facebook account.
“If Armenia had a national government, then Russia would be willing to do anything for Armenia, not the opposite, and here not Russia, but we are to blame for this, as long as we allow the existence of such government,” Danielyan said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has criticized reactions in Armenia over the deaths of a Gyumri family, killed last week by a Russian soldier who confessed to the slaying of the seven.“We can see attempts of politicizing this situation that stem neither from the Armenian government, nor from Russia. There are many who desire to use this tragedy in order to receive its geopolitical dividends,” Lavrov said at a conference in Moscow emphasizing that Armenian-Russian relations will not suffer because of this situation.On Wednesday the youngest member of the seven-member Avetisyan family, attacked and killed in Gyumri, six-month-old Seryozha Avetisyan was buried, after a week-long fight for the infant’s life failed.

related news Gyumri mass murder suspect arrested
Seryozha Avetisyan, his wife Hasmik, daughter Aida, son Armen, daughter-in-law Araksya, and two-year-old granddaughter Hasmik, were murdered in their home Monday. Only a six month old boy survived, and is hospitalized with stab wounds.
Valeri Permyakov, a Russian soldier stationed at nearby base No. 102 has been arrested and has confessed to the murders.
Permyakov was caught “as a result of joint measures” taken by the Russian border guards and Armenian security forces.
Russian investigators will lead the criminal investigation into the case.
The extraordinary crime created unease in Gyumri yesterday until the suspect was caught. Today the situation is comparatively calm, Gyumri-Asparez daily Editor Levon Barseghyan said.
“Because the Russians are investigating it is possible we and even the Armenian government are not privy to some details.
Yesterday Russian soldiers with rifles on their shoulders were searching for a criminal in the streets, and, by international agreement, they do not have such rights unless there is a direct danger threatening their families or crews. The whole point was to find him first,” Barseghyan told ArmeniaNow.
It is not the first case when the Russian military base has been connected with a major crime in the city.
In 1999 Gyumri was shocked when on April 14 two Russian servicemen of the Russian garrison border guards stationed at the base, Denisi Popov and Alexander Karmenev, left the base and opened fire randomly in Gyumri’s central market, killing 44 year-old Vaghinak Simonyan and 57-year-old Davit Soghomonyan.
On April 7, 2013 two children were killed by a mine as they were reportedly playing in the base’s tank shooting range.
Monday’s shocking multiple murders have caused a wave of anti-Russian sentiment among some residents. Many have voiced anti-Russian feelings on Facebook. Others, however, say that the nationality of the killer or of the killed has no bearing on why it happened.
In Gyumri, and indeed throughout Armenia, many wait for answers as the investigation has begun.
A makeshift vigil has appeared in front of the home of the Avetisyans in Gyumri following six murders that occurred there, shocking residents of Armenia’s “second city”.""" ;

The flow of the Gyumri residents to the St. Nshan Church does not end. After the bodies of the violently killed six-member family were transferred to the Church on January 13, the situation, taking place in the Church, is indescribable. Ambulance brigades are stationed at the entrance of the Church and Abovyan Street, where the Church is located, is under the control of the road police of the Republic of Armenia.
“We are all Avetisyans. This is our pain and tragedy”: with these words people have been moving to the Church. The Requiem Mass will be held at St. Nshan Church in Gyumri on January 14 at 17:00 and will be followed by the funeral service on January 15 at 13:00.
A joint working group comprised of representatives of regional and municipal authorities has been established by the order of governor of Shirak Province and will regulate the activities for the Requiem Mass and funeral service for the members of the Avetisyan family who were brutally murdered in Gyumri on January 12. The working group is led by Governor of Shirak Province Felix Tsolakyan.
The Russian serviceman, suspected of killing six family members in Armenia’s second largest city, was found. Valery Permyakov, who was reported to be the main suspect in the deadly incident, was found by Russian border guards in the village Bayandur (Shirak region), Armenpress reports, citing the regional prosecutor Raffi Aslanyan. He reportedly attempted to cross the Armenia-Turkey border but didn’t succeed as he was identified on the spot. The suspect is now with the Russian frontier troops. The representatives of the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Armenia and the Investigation Committee of Armenia are also in the site. The Russia's Southern Federal District Prosecutor has arrived to the site as well. The further actions are being discussed. The investigation of the criminal case has been transferred to the Investigation Committee, directly supervised by the General Prosecutor of the Republic of Armenia.
Earlier it was reported that 6 dead bodies with gunshot wounds have been found in Gyumri’s Myasnikyan 188 address.

The protest march that citizens of Gyumri began ended peacefully after having moved to the Russian 102ndmilitary base. Prosecutor of Shirak Province Raffi Aslanyan approached the participants of the march and urged them to move towards the building of the regional prosecutor’s office. Aslanyan mentioned that Permyakov has already been involved in the case as the accused. “This means that we’re carrying out the preliminary investigation in Armenia, regardless of who he’s with.” Aslanyan suggested moving towards the building of the regional prosecutor’s office and discuss the issue there. Afterwards, he contacted Armenia’s Prosecutor General Gevorg Kostanyan and transmitted his words to the participants of the march. “This evening there will be consultations, and they will continue tomorrow morning. The consultations will be followed by a statement on what will happen with the case,” Aslanyan transmitted, as “Armenpress” reports. The prosecutor of Shirak Province assured that investigation into the January 12 murder of the Avetisyans is in progress and that all the culprits will be punished.
Aslanyan suggested meeting near the building of the prosecutor’s office in two days, but the gathered refused and demanded that Permyakov be handed over to Armenian law-enforcement authorities. Journalist Levon Barseghyan said the participants of the march say they will gather on January 15 at 17:00 to get the response from the prosecutor’s office. “We’re waiting until the funeral service ends and for the prosecutors to respond that the trial for the crime that took place outside of the military base needs to be held in Armenia,” Barseghyan said, briefly.

The last time a state of emergency was declared it was a gasping effort to rescue apartheid. This time, it's to protect the first breath of democracy.
South Africa's latest crackdown offers yet another ironic example of how much things have changed.
President F.W. de Klerk imposed the crackdown on the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu and its surrounding province of Natal to stem continuing political bloodshed and protect those who want to vote in the country's first multiracial elections April 26-28.
De Klerk agreed with the elections commission that free and fair voting would not be possible as long as Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi boycotts the election and allows his Inkatha Freedom Party henchmen to discourage and terrorize others into staying away from the polls.
With opinion polls showing Buthelezi's rival Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress holding a commanding lead even among Zulus, Buthelezi is hoping to win with bullets what he appears quite likely to lose with ballots.
Inkatha's low popularity was dragged down further by a government commission's confirmation in early March that three senior policemen had been fueling political violence by supplying weapons to Inkatha. This tended to confirm that a long-suspected "third force" of white South Africans was playing a role in stirring Inkatha thugs to attack the ANC.
De Klerk's state of emergency supersedes Buthelezi's police authority in KwaZulu and assures Buthelezi that any attempt to disrupt elections will be met with force. If the Zulu leader can keep at least half the voters away from the polls, he can claim the no-shows as his own as he tries to negotiate for KwaZulu autonomy.
De Klerk has acted swiftly and properly to cool the bloodshed and assure the world that worst-case scenarios will not become reality.
Buthelezi and the other extremists are trying to cast themselves as carrying on in the tradition of past ANC rebellions, which is absurd. Buthelezi and the others, including white right-wing extremists, have been invited enthusiastically to participate in the transition and the upcoming election, but they have boycotted both.
All measures must be taken to protect the delicate birth of democracy in South Africa. This includes every possible effort to reach out to Buthelezi, engage him at the conference table and bring him back into the election process.
If he continues to resist, his dissent and the threat of violence by his followers must not be allowed to disrupt South Africa's long march to democracy just inches from its goal.""" ;

Community mourns the loss of 10 of its own as concern for survivors, victims' families grows.
Jeffrey Weise, 16, killed his grandfather and his grandfather's companion before heading to Red Lake High School, where he fatally shot five students, a teacher and a security guard before killing himself. Seven others were wounded.
"People are still in shock," said Father William Mehrkens, who has lived or worked among the reservation's estimated 5,000 Chippewa since 1991. "People need a chance to talk, and what they're talking about is concern over family and the survivors."
Native American residents in this and the other tribal villages of the Red Lake Indian Reservation have collected bundles of sage, to be given as gifts and burned during funeral ceremonies. They are assembling blankets and clothing and favorite toys, to be tucked into the caskets of the 10 people who were killed Monday.
PONEMAH, Minn. — On a sliver of a peninsula, where little is growing on land covered with thick layers of snow and ice, the people have started gathering supplies they will need for their grief.
What sparked the troubled 16-year-old's killing spree is still under investigation, and as of Wednesday afternoon, federal officials said autopsies were still being done on the victims.
Five students remain hospitalized in Bemidji, but doctors said two of the boys wounded in the shooting have recovered enough to leave the hospital by this weekend. Two others are listed in critical condition at medical facilities in Fargo, N.D.
"We all want to heal. We are just waiting for the bodies to come home," said Audrey Thayer, a friend of several of the victims' families, who also works with the Minnesota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union office in Bemidji.
Early Wednesday evening, officials on the reservation held a private memorial service for the victims and talked about when the high school might reopen. Stuart Desjarlait, the school's superintendent, estimated that it might take months for classes to be held there again.
Teachers from the school met privately to try to figure out ways to help support the students who survived the deadliest school shooting since the carnage six years ago at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
Some details of the horrifying day have begun to emerge. LeeAnn Grant, a security guard who survived the shooting at Red Lake High, told Associated Press that the scene at the school was frenzied.
Grant said she warned Derrick Brun, another security guard, to flee when Weise walked toward the school. But Brun, 28, who was killed, refused to run -- which bought Grant and students attracted by the commotion enough time to get away.
The two guards were on duty near the school's metal detector. Grant said she recognized Weise when he stepped out of his grandfather's stolen police vehicle, pulled out a shotgun and fired two blasts into the air.
Neither Brun nor Grant, a mother of two, was armed.
"He looked right at me. I made eye contact with him," Grant told Associated Press. "He walked in and fired another shot, and I was telling Derrick, 'Come on, let's go. Let's go, Derrick. Run. We need to save these kids. We need to do something.' And I radioed in ... 'There's a guy coming in the school and he's shooting and he has a gun.'
Brun "just sat there at his desk.... He didn't look scared. He didn't look surprised.... He just kept staring at Jeff. I kept hollering for him to come with me. He wouldn't come. He just stayed there.\"""" ;

Electric Daisy Carnival, a series of electronic dance music performances, carnival rides and art installations, runs from 2 p.m. to midnight Friday at the city-owned baseball field and the adjacent grounds around the Florida Citrus Bowl. It repeats the same hours on Saturday, with DJs spinning electronica and house music from four stages both days.
A two-day rave music festival that drew controversy in Los Angeles last year because of hospitalizations, more than 100 arrests and a teen's drug overdose death is coming to Orlando's Tinker Field this weekend.
It's the first time the rave has come to Orlando. The event and its promoter, Insomniac Inc., have come under fire since the same event last June at the Los Angeles Coliseum sent 120 attendees to the hospital, most of them for drug intoxication. Sasha Rodriguez, a 15-year-old girl, died after overdosing on ecstasy, and 118 people were arrested at the event, which drew some 160,000 people over two days.
A California lawmaker responded by sponsoring legislation that would have banned raves on public property like the Coliseum. An Insomniac promoter did not return a call or email.
Officials from Orlando, which owns and leases Tinker Field along with other venues, say they had no reason to turn away the Electric Daisy Carnival. Even so, city officials say they have taken extra precautions to ensure it is safe.
"We have looked at what happened in other cities and taken measures to ensure they don't happen here in Orlando," said Heather Fagan, Mayor Buddy Dyer's press secretary.
Built into the facility's rental agreement is a longer-than-usual list of items that attendees are prohibited from bringing, a list that seems fashioned to prevent the illicit drugs that have been historically popular at raves, such as ecstasy.
The banned list includes open cigarette packs, unsealed tampons, eye drops and lip balm, along with backpacks and other containers that could hide alcohol or drugs.
There will be alcohol at Electric Daisy, which has four full bars and one beer stand. But the event's web page indicates there's a "zero tolerance" policy for drugs and warns that narcotics officers will be on patrol.
The rental agreement also limits attendance to 20,000 — much smaller than at the substantially bigger venue in Los Angeles. And because most of the trouble in California came in the wee hours of the morning, Orlando's event must end at midnight.
The rental terms fine the promoter $5,000 every 15 minutes that the music keeps playing after midnight.
The party doesn't necessarily end, it just continues elsewhere. There is a separately ticketed after-party at an Orlando nightclub each night.

<http://articles.philly.com/2003-01-16/news/25468812_1_crack-house-massacre-pistol> dct:description """The prosecutors' key witness testified that all four men wore rubber gloves, and described the firearm each carried when they arrived at the West Philadelphia rowhouse.
Veney said that he knocked on the door and asked to buy two rocks of crack. When someone inside opened the door, the other three ran in with their faces partially covered. Veney stayed outside and stood guard, he said.
After three minutes passed, Veney said, he nervously looked inside the house to hurry the others. He said he saw the Faruqi brothers leading victims downstairs.
"They was patting down their pockets and waists and stuff," Veney testified. In the back, he said, he saw Black kicking someone who was on the ground.
When shots rang out, he fled back to his car, Veney said. The others quickly joined him, and they sped away in Veney's Jeep.
"I asked, 'What happened? What did you all do?' " Veney said, and testified that Dawid Faruqi told him that the turtleneck collar he had used to cover most of his face had fallen down in front of the victims.
"Shihean said, 'We had no choice,' " Veney testified. Seven people, including Porter, were killed execution-style after they were herded into one room. Three shooting victims survived the massacre.
Veney said that the four went back to his apartment and split $200 taken from the victims. He said Black also kept $400 worth of drugs, a blue jacket, and a silver chain and pendant.
Veney testified that he was armed with a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun. Black carried a 9mm Ruger pistol, Dawid Faruqi a 9mm Glock semiautomatic pistol, and Khalid Faruqi a 9mm Jennings semiautomatic pistol, Veney said.
"That was their personal guns. . . . They always carried them," Veney testified.
Assistant District Attorney Mark Gilson said after the hearing that Veney's testimony was consistent and credible.
"In the end, it will be the physical evidence in this case that convicts the Faruqis and 'Shi' Black," Gilson said, noting that Veney's descriptions matched ballistics evidence and that investigators had recovered the Glock pistol used in the murders.
But defense attorneys Todd Henry and Robert Gamburg, representing Dawid and Khalid Faruqi, criticized Veney's testimony after the hearing.
"I think his credibility is shot," Gamburg said. Veney testified that he saw Khalid Faruqi almost every day in 2000, but Khalid Faruqi was in prison on drug charges until two days before the Lex Street killings, he said.
And although Veney testified he was the watchman, Black had told investigators earlier that he was the one guarding the door, Henry said.
At the conclusion of the hour-long preliminary hearing for Dawid Faruqi, 28, and Khalid Faruqi, 27, Municipal Court Judge Seamus P. McCaffrey ordered them to stand trial on seven counts of first-degree murder in the death-penalty case. The brothers are scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 5.
Black, 20, waived his preliminary hearing last week and was ordered held for trial on identical charges. Gilson said he had not yet offered a plea deal to Black's attorney, but he has said that he would not pursue the death penalty in exchange for a guilty plea with a life prison sentence.
Veney, who prosecutors believe was not a shooter, pleaded guilty in November in exchange for a 15- to 30-year prison sentence and agreed to testify against the others. The plea deal with Veney was critical for prosecutors to solidify the troubled case.
Investigators initially arrested four other men and charged them with the killings.
But when new evidence emerged in July, the District Attorney's Office was forced to drop all charges against the first four suspects, who had been jailed for 18 months awaiting a death-penalty trial. Last week, the original suspects filed lawsuits against the city and police.
Detectives initially believed the killings had been part of a drug turf war, but Veney said the dispute originated after Porter and Black traded cars.
"George Porter had burned out the clutch, and he went back and wanted his car back," Veney testified yesterday. Black was angry with Porter and wanted money from him to fix the car, he said.
On the night of the killings, the four men gathered in the basement of Black's grandmother's house, Veney said.
"[Black] turned to me and said that the guys . . . owed him some money for his car and they were going to rob them," Veney said, adding that Black instructed him to drive and serve as lookout.
Veney, Black and the Faruqis were charged in November with the killings.

<http://articles.philly.com/2008-02-01/news/25265799_1_campaign-manager-david-plouffe-obama-democratic-caucuses> dct:description """That might seem chump change compared with big prizes such as California, but Obama's strategists hope to win delegates in Republican-dominated states including Kansas, Idaho, Utah and North Dakota, and, more broadly, to show that the Illinois senator can run well in places inhospitable to most national Democrats.
Campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters in a recent conference call that the key to small states such as Kansas, one of 16 where voters can switch parties at the polling place Tuesday, is to attract independents and disaffected Republicans.
Conversations with undecided voters after Obama's visit found people intrigued by his style and his message of change, but as yet unsold.
"For me, it's got to be more than 'He's different.' Different isn't necessarily better," said Adelita Stanley, 20, a waitress at Job Lunch, who is eligible to cast her first presidential ballot Tuesday. "Hillary? It's got to be more than 'She's a woman like me.' " Stanley said she would like to learn more about the two candidates' health-care plans to help her decide.
Laurie Hutchins, the cook at the self-described "best little veal house in Kansas," is an independent who is attracted to Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona by what she called his blunt honesty. She said she would consider voting for Obama, but added: "I'm just not as informed about him. Where'd he come from? He just appeared out the blue one day."
Lee Baker, a contractor from Wichita eating a piece of pie at the counter, said Obama makes an emotional connection with listeners but also strikes Baker as vague.
"He's one hell of a talker, in the same class as Jack Kennedy, but it's hard to know where he stands exactly," said Baker, 56, an independent conservative. "I don't like Hillary, though, so I'm glad he's knocking her out of the saddle."
Dwight Wernli, a registered Democrat, said he was still looking at his choices. "That visit here probably helped Obama a lot - it was pretty exciting for the town," Wernli, 60, said at his barbershop on North Main Street. "Most people have had enough of the Clintons. Bill needs to go off fishing somewhere."
Obama campaign organizers arrived in Kansas in October, state Democrats said, about three months before Clinton's people arrived, and he has six times as many paid staff in the state - 18 to three - as the New York senator.
Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who endorsed Obama this week, has won twice in the state and governs by appealing to moderate Republicans who are fed up with what they see as the intense Kansas breed of socially conservative Republicans.
"Kansas is really a three-party state," said Joe Aistrup, chairman of the political science department at Kansas State University. "The balance of power depends on what alliances form around individual issues."
Independents and Republicans have shown a willingness to vote for Democrats for other statewide offices and for Congress in recent years. Two of Kansas' representatives are Democrats.
Still, Republicans have firm control of both houses of the legislature, and no Democratic nominee for president has carried Kansas since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
Clinton supporters here say that strong support from labor unions and stalwart Democratic activists will counter Obama's organizing effort, which includes endorsements by 13 prominent Democratic legislators.
"They have left no stone unturned," said State Sen. David Haley, referring to Obama's campaign. "I've never seen anything so well-run in my 22 years in state politics."
Haley, of Kansas City, Kan., was the state chairman for New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who dropped out of the race last month. But Haley said Obama organizers kept in touch anyway, informing him of their activities in his district and inviting him to events. When Richardson quit, "it wasn't a hard sale," Haley said.
State Rep. Candy Ruff, a conservative Democrat from Leavenworth, said she believed Obama would be stronger at the top of the ticket for the party's legislative and local candidates.
"Think about it, guy: He's not Hillary Clinton," said Ruff, who has sponsored a bill allowing people to carry concealed weapons. "The Republicans are in disarray, but she would make them new best friends. . . .
"Kansas Democrats are not the lefties from the Northeast. We don't hug trees on a daily basis out here, and half the Democrats are pro-life and pro-gun."

The rush for tickets, historic even by Ultra standards, was fueled by a lineup that offers a remarkable range of artists, more than 300 strong, many who have little to do with turntable culture, strictly speaking. Included among the acts performing Friday through Sunday are top DJ-producers such as Tiesto, Skrillex and Carl Cox; tech-y innovators Kraftwerk; dance-pop throwbacks New Order; and crossover populists such as Fatboy Slim and David Guetta.
One positive in the success of UMF is that it has spawned some new ideas to keep ticket-less fans plugged in, including a free high-definition live stream on the festival’s YouTube channel, Youtube.com/UMFTV. The stream goes up at 4 p.m. Friday and runs 24-7 through Sunday night (but don’t forget Sunday’s “Mad Men” season premiere!).
A documentary about the festival, “Can U Feel It,” was shot at a special pre-performance at Bayfront Park Wednesday night and is scheduled to screen at 16 South Florida theaters Thursday night. Tiësto, Guetta, Cox, Afrojack, Fedde Le Grand and Boys Noize are among those offering insight into the festival and the state of electronic music .

MEET FOXY BROWN
Like many downtown Fort Lauderdale denizens, we had high hopes for the space at 723 E. Broward Blvd., after the building, the longtime home to the News Room Cafe, was adorned with a mural suggesting a relaxing Italian terrace and a sign reading, “Biagio’s.” And then, we were saddened to see the sign come down and watch painters cover the mural in more-sophisticated stacks of mocha browns. But there is a very bright side. The new place, which opened a week ago with the name the Foxy Brown, is a fresh, chic restaurant operated by Elliot Wolfe, owner of the consistently excellent Coconuts on Fort Lauderdale beach. All the local goodness you associate with Coconuts is on the menu (yes, the crab cakes are here), along with a thoughtful and democratic wine and beer list (from PBR in a can to Southern Tier 2XIPA on tap). The small space (with covered outdoor tables in back) is all serious, warm woods, but manager Derryck Broughton assures “We’re very family friendly,” urging a visitor to return for the house-made shakes and root beer. If you’re into that kind of thing. Trivia: The place is not named for the kitschy Pam Grier movie, but for a partner’s dog. Info: 754-200-4236.""" ;

The sitting Naroda MLA Mayaben Kodnani was sentenced to 18 year of imprisonment for criminal conspiracy and murder, while Babu Bajrangi was sentenced for life imprisonment till death.
AHMEDABAD: A Special Investigation Team ( SIT) court has awarded life term to BJP leader and former minister Mayaben Kodnani and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi in the Naroda Patia massacre case.
The court also sentenced Mayaben to 10 year imprisonment for arson. The court observed that this imprisonment of 10 years will not run concurrent with the main sentence of 18 years, which means Kodnani will spend 28 years in prison.
The court in the order pronounced on Friday sentenced 22 accused to life imprisonment (14 years). Other seven were sentenced to imprisonment for 21 years. The quantum of punishment was not announced for one of the accused Suresh alias Shahjad Nekalkar as he was not present in the court.
The court also also sentenced the 31 accused to 10 years imprisonment for arson. The sentence would run prior to the main sentence and would not be concurrent.
The court named Kodnani, a sitting MLA and former Gujarat minister, as "a kingpin of riots" in Naroda area and sentenced her to 18-year life imprisonment after serving 10 years jail term under IPC Section 326 (voluntary causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means).
"Communal riots are like cancer on constitutional secularism and the incident in Naroda Patiya was a black chapter in the history of the Indian Constitution," the judge observed. The other seven who were sentenced 21 years of imprisonment included Naresh Chara, Morli Sindhi, Haresh Rathod, Suresh Langado, Premchand Tiwari, Manojbhai Sindhi Kukrani and Bipin Panchal.
The special court also observed that the incident was a black chapter in the secular democratic history of India. On Wednesday, the court had convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 in the biggest post-Godhra killings.
On February 28, 2002, 97 persons were killed in Naroda. As many as 94 bodies were found, of which 84 were identified. Three people are still missing.
Former Gujarat minister Kodnani and Bajrangi have been convicted under sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code, amongst others.
Special public prosecutor sought capital punishment for the convicts, during the hearing for quantum of punishment. He argued that as the court had upheld the aspect of murder and criminal conspiracy, this was a fit case to be termed as "rarest of rare" and court should award capital punishment to the convicts. If the court wanted to be lenient then at least it should award minimum of 20 years of imprisonment to each of the convicts, he argued.
Opposing his contention, defense advocate Niranjan Tikani appealed to the court to show leniency towards the convicts, keeping in mind their family background and financial condition.""" ;

According to preliminary information, he was trying to cross the Armenian-Turkish border. The Prosecutor said Permyakov is currently held by Russian officials at that country’s military base in Gyumri.
Representatives of regional and municipal authorities of Shirak, police and special investigative groups have arrived in Bayandur.
A manhunt was underway in the Shirak region of Armenia for a Permyakov who deserted his post and went on a rampage, killing six members of an Armenian family, among them a two-year girl. A six-month old infant survived the attack but is in critical condition at a local hospital, news agencies reported Monday.
“Military boots with the name and surname of the serviceman have been found at the site,” she added. An AK 74 rifle and 5.45 mm caliber shells have also been found.
Truzyan also identified the murder victims as Seryozha Avetisyan, Hasmik Avetisyan, Armen Avetisyan, Araksya Avetisyan, Aida Avetisyan, Hasmik Avetisyan (2-year-old girl), and Seryozha Avetisyan (6-month-old boy).
The Police have issued a statement calling on all those who have seen Valery Permyakov to call the number or visit the nearest police station. The Police said they are investigating the crime together with representatives from the military base.
All roads leading to Gyumri are blocked now and controlled by police as the suspect is believed to be armed.
Infant ‘Saved By Miracle’
Seryozha Avetisyan, who is only several months old, was operated on after being hospitalized in the wake of the violent act that left six in the family killed, Tert.am reported.
His condition is estimated as stable. The head of Gyumri’s Australian hospital, Ashot Kurghinyan, has told the state news agency Armenspress that the infant was hospitalized in a critical condition, with stab wounds in the chest.
“The infant was found on the mother’s dead body; the perpetrator probably thought he was dead, whereas he had been breathing. The child was hospitalized late; he was in a shock, cold and almost bloodless,” Kurgjinhyan said, adding that he finds the successful surgery a miracle.
“Yes, we can now say that the infant was saved by a miracle, but his condition continues to remain grave but stable. He is surviving a shock and is in the intensive care department switched to an artificial breathing aid. We are hopeful he will be strong enough to overcome it,” he added.
The infant was hospitalized without consciousness in the afternoon.
“I guess the infant was brought to us four or even five hours after the incident. He was in that condition for such a long time; there was a loss of blood and so on. Seeing that the infant’s vital organs are not essentially damaged, we can make positive forecasts, but it is too early to speak with guarantees today,” the doctor added.
Sarkisian Holds Urgent Consultation
President Serzh Sarisian on Monday held urgent consultations with the heads of law-enforcement bodies regarding the heinous murder.
Sarkisian stressed the importance of ascertaining the details of the case, detaining the guilty and holding them accountable.
The leadership of the Russian Military Base in Gyumri is cooperating with the Armenian law-enforcement bodies and is providing practical support to the investigation of the case.
Sarkisian also offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims and said he shared the sorrow and pain of the family.
Russian Embassy issues Statement
The Russian Embassy in Armenia issued a statement Monday about the murders, expressing shock and offering all resources in the ongoing investigation of the crime.
“We are shocked by this terrible crime. We mourn with the Armenian people. We offer our condolences to the families and friends of the victims,” said the statement. “The perpetrators of this vicious crime should be given the most severe punishment.”
“The relevant bodies of the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation are taking all necessary measures with a view of ensuring a fair and comprehensive investigation of the incident,” added the statement.
“The investigative groups are coordinating efforts in full compliance with the Agreement of the Presence of the 102nd Russian military base on the territory of the Republic of Armenia,” explained the statement.
On Monday, Armenia’s Defense Minister Seyran Ohanian had a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu, while Armenia’s Deputy Defense Minister David Tonoyan, spoke to his Russian counterpart.
A special commission will arrive from the Russia to investigate the incident, Spokesman of Armenia’s Defense Ministry Artsrun Hovhannisyan said in a Facebook post.
Armenia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Shavarsh Kocharyan met with the Russian Ambassador to Armenia Ivan Volynkin.
He stressed that the Russian military base in Gyumri was cooperating with the Armenian law-enforcement bodies and provides necessary assistance.

[Extensions of Remarks] [Page E211] HONORING THE VICTIMS OF SUMGAIT ______ HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Thursday, February 28, 2013 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the pogrom against people of Armenian descent in the town of Sumgait, Azerbaijan. The three-day massacre in the winter of 1988 resulted in the deaths of scores of Armenians, many of whom were burnt to death after being brutally beaten and tortured. Hundreds of others were wounded. Women and girls were brutally raped. The carnage created thousands of ethnic Armenian refugees, who had to leave everything behind to be looted or destroyed, including their homes, cars and businesses. These crimes, which were proceeded by a wave of anti-Armenian rallies throughout Azerbaijan, were never adequately prosecuted by Azerbaijan authorities. Many who organized or participated in the bloodshed have gone on to serve in high positions on the Azeri government. For example, in the days leading up to the massacre, a leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Hidayat Orujev, warned Armenians in Sumgait: ``If you do not stop campaigning for the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, if you don't sober up, 100,000 Azeris from neighboring districts will break into your houses, torch your apartments, rape your women, and kill your children.'' In a cruel twist, Orujev went on serve as Azerbaijan's State Advisor for Ethnic Policy and later as head of State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations. The Sumgait massacres led to wider reprisals against Azerbaijan's ethnic minority, resulting in the virtual disappearance of Azerbaijan's 450,000-strong Armenian community, and culminating in the war launched against the people of Nagorno Karabakh. That war resulted in almost 30,000 dead on both sides and created more than one million refugees in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. In the years since the fighting ended, the people of Artsakh, the region's ancestral name, have struggled to build a functioning democratic state in the midst of unremitting hostility and threats from Azerbaijan, as well as sniper fire and other incursions across the Line of Contact between the two sides. Hatred towards Armenians is both inculcated and celebrated in Azeri youth, as exemplified by the case of Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani army captain who had confessed to the savage 2004 axe murder of Armenian army lieutenant Gurgen Margaryan, while the latter slept. At the time, the two were participating in a NATO Partnership for Peace exercise in Budapest, Hungary. After the murder, Safarov was sentenced to life in prison by a Hungarian court and imprisoned in Hungary. Last August Safarov was sent home to Azerbaijan, purportedly to serve out the remainder of his sentence. Instead of prison, he was greeted as a hero by the Azeri government and promenaded through the streets of Baku carrying a bouquet of roses. President Ilham Aliyev immediately pardoned Safarov and he was promoted to the rank of major and given a new apartment and eight years of back pay. In recent weeks, 75-year-old Akram Aylisli, one of Azerbaijan's most celebrated writers, has been subjected to a campaign of hatred. According to a report in the BBC, '[h]is books have been publicly burnt. He has been stripped of his national literary awards. And a high-ranking Azeri politician has offered $13,000 as a bounty for anyone who will cut off his ear. Aylisi's 'crime?'-- in his short novel Stone Dreams, he dared to look at the conflict between Azeris and Armenians from the Armenian perspective. With these disgusting acts, the Azeri state reminded the whole world why the people of Artsakh must be allowed to determine their own future and cannot be allowed to slip into Aliyev's clutches, lest the carnage of Sumgait a quarter century ago serve as a foreshadowing of a greater slaughter. ____________________

<http://beta.trtworld.com/turkey/turkish-police-diyarbakir-bomber-has-isis-connections-3064> dct:description """Turkish media has reported a suspect detained last Wednesday for the bombing of a rally by the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in Turkey’s southeastern province of Diyarbakir two days before Turkey’s June 7 general elections claimed to have links with ISIS in his statement to Turkish police.
The suspect, Orhan Gonder, reportedly said that he joined ISIS in October 2014 following Kurdish riots over Kobane between Oct. 6-7 after he was threatened by the Patriotic Revolutionist Youth Movement (YDG-H), the youth wing of the outlawed PKK.
The events of Oct. 6-7 took place after HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas called his party’s supporters to the streets to rally in support of the northern Syrian city Kobane, which was at the time besieged by ISIS.
The protests triggered attacks on the Kurdish Free Cause Party (Huda-Par) supporters by the YDG-H which is blamed for the attacks and the deaths of more than 40 people.
The Huda-Par is considered to be a conservative Kurdish movement while the YDG-H is regarded as being leftwing and secularist and close to the HDP.
Gonder said in the testimony he gave to the police that he received the order to undertake the bombings from a man code named “Serdar” stationed in the ISIS camps in Syria and known for other ISIS activities. Gonder had been trained for bombing missions by ISIS operatives in the camps, his testimony claimed.
Gonder said, “Serdar gave me two bombs and three cell phones. He told me after I crossed the Syrian border I will be welcomed by somebody who will escort me to Gaziantep [a Turkish border city] from where he ordered me to pass by bus Diyarbakır through Sanliurfa.”
Gonder, whose code name in ISIS is allegedly “Cengiz,” arrived in Diyarbakir and checked into a hotel in the neighbourhood of Dagkapi before the the HDP rally on June 5, he is reported to have stated.
The suspect planted one of the bombs in a trash can in the square where the rally took place and another in a mobile tea shop whose owner also allegedly has links to to ISIS, according to the suspect’s statement.
Three people were killed and 100 others were injured by two simultaneous blasts detonated by a mobile phone at the rally. Demirtas said one blast was just 30 meters away from the place where he was making his speech.
Turkish media reported that Gonder moved to Gaziantep by bus and settled in a cell house where he was detained by security forces following the bombings.
Gonder said, “I called somebody in Gaziantep and told him that I need to go to Syria. He rebuffed me and turned off the phone. I was detained afterwards,” according to the testimony.
Diyarbakir Chief Prosecutor Ramazan Solmaz previously issued a written statement saying that the suspect is facing charges of “voluntary manslaughter” and “being a member of armed terrorist organisation.”
Turkish daily Sabah reported that Turkish officials have assessed that “Serdar”, the man behind the Diyarbakir bombings, also ordered Muhammad al Rashid to pass three British girls to Syria through Turkey.
Rashid has a Canadian passport, but he is originally from Syria. He was detained in Sanliurfa, a Turkish border province to Syria, on accusations of illegally smuggling British girls and foreign fighters into Syria and is also alleged to have connections with the Canadian and British intelligence services.
Related Story Spy helping British girls confessed working for Canada
Sabah also reported that Turkish officials have said that the recent clashes between YDG-H and Huda-Par members in Diyarbakir were directed by the same forces.
Aytac Baran, president of a conservative NGO organisation named Yeni Ihya-Der and member of the Huda-Par was killed in an armed attack in Diyarbakir last Tuesday after unknown assailants attacked him near his home.
Violent clashes erupted following the assassination and led to the killing of three more citizens, allegedly HDP members, while four others were injured - including journalists and a policeman.
Turkish officials have indicated that foreign intelligence services are aiming to create internal conflicts in the southeastern region in order to destabilise Turkey, the Sabah report added.
The HDP has taken part in Turkey’s general election for the first time as a political party, while the Huda-Par put its candidates in for elections as independents. The HDP passed the 10 percent electoral threshold by gaining 13 percent of the vote, allowing it to win 80 seats in the Turkish parliament.
Today Turkish media reported that a fourth victim of the Diyarbakir bomb attack, Ali Turkman, has died from his injuries.""" ;

<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5b19c54b714a401ba403f7e9c3817204/thai-police-seek-2-new-suspects-bangkok-bombing-probe> dct:description """BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police issued arrest warrants Monday for two more suspects, a Thai woman and a foreign man of unknown nationality, as part of a widening investigation that yielded its first arrest over the weekend in connection with a deadly bombing in Bangkok two weeks ago.
National police spokesman Prawuth Thavornsiri said he was certain the two were part of a group responsible for the Aug. 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine in central Bangkok that killed 20 people, more than half of them foreigners.
In a televised announcement on Monday, Prawuth displayed a photograph of the woman's Thai identification card showing a young woman in a black headscarf, and a sketch of the man. He later said police were asking for additional arrest warrants.
Police said Monday evening that relatives of the woman, identified as 26-year-old Wanna Suansun, said they believe she is in Turkey.
The developments came after police arrested a man in an apartment in Bangkok's outskirts on Saturday and seized bomb-making equipment that included detonators, ball bearings and a metal pipe that could serve as a bomb casing.
Police, meanwhile, awarded themselves a 3 million baht, or $84,000, reward Monday offered for tips leading to the arrest of bombing suspects.
National police chief Somyot Poompanmoung said he was taking the unusual step of giving the reward to the police force both to motivate his officers and to show that Thailand's police are good at their work.
"This money should be given to officials who did their job," he said at a news conference as aides brought out stacks of 1,000-baht notes. It wasn't immediately clear how the money would be distributed to police officers.
More bomb-making materials were discovered in a second apartment during a raid Sunday in a nearby neighborhood, said Prawuth. He said that apartment, in a neighborhood known as Min Buri, was rented by Wanna Suansun, also known by the name Mai Saloh. He said the woman has a house registration in the southern Thai province of Phang Nga.
Police raided the house in Phang Nga, but failed to find her.
Police Maj. Gen Chalit Keawyarat said her relatives told them she had been away for more than three months, and they believed she was in Turkey because her husband is Turkish.
"The relatives are trying to contact her so that she could prove her innocence to the police. The relatives believe she is not involved," Chalit said.
Turkey has previously figured in the bombing investigation.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, sparking an array of theories about who might be behind it. Police have suggested that the suspects were part of a people-smuggling group who held a grudge against Thai authorities.
Speculation has grown, however, that the suspect might be part of a group seeking to avenge Thailand's forced repatriation of ethnic Uighurs to China in July.
Uighurs are related to Turks, and Turkey is home to a large Uighur community. The Erawan Shrine is especially popular with Chinese tourists, feeding the idea that it could be a target for people who believe the Uighurs are oppressed by China's government. Beijing says some Uighurs are Islamist terrorists, and among them is a group that has been smuggled out of China to join Islamic State fighters in Syria.
The suspect arrested Saturday had a Turkish passport, though Thai authorities say it was fake. At his apartment, they seized at least 11 passports that appeared to be Turkish, among more than 200 passports in all.
Much remains unknown about the man arrested Saturday, including his true name and nationality and his motive. On Sunday, Prawuth said police were working with "a number of embassies" and interpreters to try to establish the man's nationality, adding that he did not speak Thai but spoke some English.
Authorities have dodged questions about whether the suspect is believed to be Turkish, declaring that the Turkish Embassy said he isn't.
A Turkish Foreign Ministry official said reports that the woman wanted by Thai police may be in Turkey and other allegations about a Turkish connection were "speculation" and that the ministry would not comment on speculation.
The official said he had no information about the woman and could not confirm that her husband is Turkish.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar officials from speaking to journalists without prior authorization.
Other possibilities are that the perpetrators are Muslim separatists from southern Thailand, opponents of Thailand's military government or feuding factions within the security services.
Prawuth described what police found in the second Bangkok apartment as "important bomb-making materials such as gunpowder, urea-based fertilizer which can be used as explosive powder when mixed with other substances, a remote-controlled car with its controller which can be used as a detonator, nuts and bolts, small light bulbs and digital watches," among other things.
The arrest warrants for Wanna Suansun and the unnamed man say they are wanted on a charge of conspiracy to possess unauthorized war material, a reference to the gunpowder.
The wanted man, whose face is shown in a police sketch with short brown hair and a light beard and mustache, is believed to have lived in the apartment rented by the woman, said Prawuth, adding that his nationality is not known. He told The Associated Press the man's name is Jusuf, but did not explain how he learned that or give a precise spelling.
The blast at the Erawan Shrine was unprecedented in the Thai capital, where smaller bombs have been employed in domestic political violence over the past decade, but not in an effort to cause large-scale casualties.

<http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/02/uah_campus_memorial_service.html> dct:description """HUNTSVILLE , AL -- At the end of a week of words and music, the shouts and sobs, the sirens and the echo of bullets in a conference room, came silence, and darkness and 3,000 people holding quiet together in a ring of prayer.
Then, at the conclusion of Friday night's memorial service at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the supertitles for the surreal tragedy of the last week glowed out of the darkness - the names of three professors appeared, one at a time, stark white in the darkness of Spragins Hall auditorium, stamped across the line between Earth and Heaven.
Each was announced by a single chime. Each bloomed into light for one minute, then evaporated into the well of darkness as students, staff, faculty and community members listened to the emptiness left by their deaths Feb. 12.
Maria Ragland Davis.
Adriel D. Johnson
Gopi K. Padila.
The last name vanished. Then out of the black rose the sorrowful pronouncement of "Alleluia," as the UAH Concert Choir sang the strains of grief braided with joy and faith, of praise to God in the midst of death.
As Randall Thompson's classic prayer rose in energy and volume, the lights came up, illuminating the draped white scrim above the choir, like sunlight on clouds, like hope after death. And the upturned faces around the auditorium gradually came into focus in the soft light.
What's 'normal'?
Friday night's memorial service was designed to move from memory and sorrow to hope, said Dr. Erin Colwitz, director of UAH choral activities. Music included the choral finale to Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," arranged by UAH music student Curtis Lindsay.
Music professor Don Bowyer wrote "Unity" especially for the service. In it, his trombone struggled to keep a calm melody while the timpani kept disrupting the line with an urgent tattoo.
His piece seemed to echo the past week's "communication marked by broken sentences," described by student Kimberli Helms in her remarks, and the kaleidoscope of emotions described by Professor Letha Etzkorn, the faculty Senate president.
"On Sunday, I was watching the snow fall," Etzkorn said. "I think it's impossible to have hatred in your heart when you're watching the snow fall. I wish the snow had been falling on the campus last Friday."
"How do we go back to 'normal'?" asked Professor Sonja Brown-Givens. "I don't think it's possible, not for a while. But what I take from the last week is that in my nine years on this campus, I have never felt more love here."
"It may be impossible to stop acts of random violence," said Hanu Karlapalem, a UAH alumnus. "But it is possible to learn the path of non-violence, of unity, of peace. It is possible to promote the spread of a culture of non-violence, diversity, unity, tolerance, civility, of human values and of unselfish service to humanity."
Blue lights
Amy Bishop, the aggrieved biology professor who is accused of shooting six of her colleagues, was mentioned twice. In the opening prayer by campus chaplain, Rev. Natalie Bennett prayed, "We cannot understand Amy's actions, but we pray for her and for her family." And Etzkorn urged those present to remember Bishop's "innocent children."
Those attending were subdued, first breaking in a quiet applause as UAH head of public safety Charles Gailes Jr. praised the quick, effective response of the campus police and city emergency workers to the shooting.
Police officers from UAB and UA Tuscaloosa have been sent to augment and relieve the UAH police this week, according to Ray Garner, university spokesmen. The blue lights of their cruisers marked the path to the parking lots as cars rolled in for the program.
Inside the gym, David Harwell, who directs the theater program at UAH, had designed lights that washed the stage in a pool of blue light, and elevated the wind ensemble and chorus into the heavens.
But the best lighting effects came at the end when everyone stood together and lit the tiny blue pen lights that had been handed out, along with blue and black ribbons, to everyone who came. The still blue flames circled the auditorium as people sang the school's "Alma Mater" together.
"This is a time to remember and a time to move forward," said Dr. David Williams, university president. "This is a time to begin the healing, to start what we must do: Move forward together."
Messages of love
A banner signed by community leaders and workers at Redstone Arsenal during a memorial Friday morning for both the UAH victims and for Todd Brown, the student killed recently at Discovery Middle School greeted those who came to the service.
Art students had prepared thousands of folded cards and baskets on which those attending could write messages of sorrow, hope and prayers. The messages were tied with gilded thread to six ficus trees that will be moved into the Shelby Center , where the shooting took place.
The trees honor the six people shot Friday, which include Dr. Joseph Leahy and staff member Stephanie Monticciolo, who both remain hospitalized in critical condition. Dr. Luis Cruz-Vera has been released from the hospital.
Dr. Johnson's funeral
Earlier Friday, Dr. Adriel D. Johnson, associate professor at UAH, was remembered for his contributions to family, church, education and Boy Scouts during his funeral at Union Chapel Missionary Baptist Church .
An overflow crowd, including local and state university officials, attended the 2 1/2-hour service, which included tributes from Johnson's sons, A.D. and Jariel, and a member of the state Boy Scouts staff.
Johnson, 52, was an Eagle scout and assistant scoutmaster of Troop 102.
"We're not here because somebody died, but because someone lived,'' said the Boy Scout staff member. "When we look between the dashes of 1957 and 2010 (the years of Johnson's life), we can understand why so many are here.''
"When we look between the dashes, we see a visionary,'' the Boy Scout official said. "We see a leader for his role as role model and mentor. We can see so many Boy Scouts he poured his life into. His legacy on earth will be carried out by those he touched.
"Because of that spirit, we'll have better husbands, better fathers and better community leaders.''
Johnson's youngest son, Jariel, recalled how his father supported him in sports.
"He was always there,'' he said. "I can still see him when I finished a race in cross country. He was there to shake my hand and say 'good job,' even if I finished in the middle.''
A.D., Johnson's elder son, emphasized the family's strong faith.
"Everything that was done in (his father's) life and what is being done now and what will continue to be done'' is God's will, A.D. said.
It is difficult, he said. But he is not angry, he said, because he realized "it was for the glory of God. We will continue to give Him that glory He deserves.''
His remarks echoed those of Dr. O. Wendell Davis, pastor of Union Chapel who officiated at the funeral.
"We're not angry," Davis said. "We're just praying, and let God get the glory for all that He does.''

<http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/05/prosecutors_to_seek_death_pena.html> dct:description """HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against accused UAH shooter Amy Bishop, Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said today.
Bishop, 46, is charged with capital murder in the Feb. 12, 2010, shooting rampage at the University of Alabama in Huntsville that left three of her biology faculty colleagues dead. She also faces attempted murder charges for the shootings of three other biology department employees.
The Harvard-trained biologist is accused of killing Dr. Maria Ragland Davis, Dr. Adriel Johnson and department chair Dr. Gopi Podila. She is also charged with attempting to kill Dr. Joseph Leahy, a biology faculty member, staff assistant Stephanie Monticciolo and Dr. Luis Cruz-Vera. Leahy and Monticciolo were severely wounded; Cruz-Vera returned to work shortly after the shootings.
Broussard said he told Circuit Judge Alan Mann and Bishop's attorneys Roy Miller and Barry Abston at a status conference last month that the state would pursue the death penalty for Bishop.
"When the judge broached the subject of the death penalty on the record and in open court," Broussard said, "we informed him and the defense that the state is in fact seeking the death penalty in this case."
Broussard is prosecuting the case with Assistant District Attorneys Tim Gann and Maggie Golden Wallace. Bishop's attorney said prosecutors did inform the defense about their plans to seek the death penalty.
"To my knowledge, no written motions were filed in this direction," Miller said. "But we were informed, whether it was in (the judge's) chambers or in some sort of proceeding. It comes as no surprise and we are prepared to go in that direction."
There is no clear timeline for Bishop's case going to trial. She was indicted in March and her attorneys have notified the court they intend to use a defense of "not guilty by reason of insanity."
A capital murder trial has two phases if prosecutors seek the death penalty. The first is the trial. If Bishop is convicted, a penalty phase would be held with the same jury.
The penalty phase focuses on the defense offering mitigating circumstances that might cause a jury to recommend a sentence of life without parole. Prosecutors would tell the jury about aggravating factors that warrant a death sentence.
There are several aggravating factors under the law in Alabama, including knowingly creating a great risk of death to many persons, an offense that was especially heinous or cruel, and an offense that intentionally kills two or more people by one act or scheme.
Among mitigating factors are the defendant's lack of a significant criminal history, that the offense occurred under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and the capacity of the defendant to recognize the criminality of the conduct.
The jury makes a sentencing recommendation, weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances
The trial judge in Alabama has the final word on the sentence and is not bound by the jury's recommendation.
There are four women on death row in Alabama, three were each convicted of killing one of their children and the fourth faces a death sentence for arranging the shooting death of her husband who testified against her before a grand jury in a bigamy case.
There are 199 male inmates currently on death row in Alabama, according to the Alabama Department of Corrections. Alabama has executed just over 200 male inmates since 1927.
State records indicate Alabama has executed four women since 1930. The most recent was the 2002 electric chair execution of Lynda Lyon Block, who had been convicted of murdering an Opelika police officer.
Bishop is also charged with the 1986 murder of her brother Seth, in Braintree, Mass. The shooting had originally been ruled an accident, but after the UAH shootings, prosecutors reopened that case and a grand jury indicted Bishop on the murder charge.""" ;

Tuesday will mark the 20th anniversary of the start of the event that left Birmingham covered with 13 inches of snow and quickly came to be known as the Storm of The Century.
The blizzard caused 14 deaths statewide, $50 million in damages and is designated by the National Weather Service as one of the state's top 10 weather stories of the 20th century. Power went out in more than 400,000 homes statewide and it took days, in some cases weeks, for it to return.

SUNDAY
- Doris Hart, 90, of Tillamook died of a "coronary incident."
According to Dr. Paul Betlinski, the Tillamook County medical examiner, Hart had arranged to visit a nearby friend when and if the storm hit and she lost power.
Hart, who lives alone, would pack a bag and her heart medications, and then wait for the friend to collect her. She was found Monday morning in front of her home in Southeast Tillamook. A small suitcase and her purse were found nearby.
It was unclear whether she was waiting for a ride, but the friend never arrived.
MONDAY
- Teresa Marie Hurliman, 54, of Cloverdale, was swept away when her truck became stuck in the Nehalem River near Shiffman and Miami Foley roads.
Three men rushed to her aid, using the frontloader of a backhoe to try to save Hurliman. But they couldn't reach her in time and her pickup was swept away with her in the front seat.
She is presumed to have drowned.
- A 22-year-old Mason County, Wash., man died after getting buried inside a home that was hit with a mudslide.
Michael A. Glenn was inside a home in the Holiday Beach area when a mudslide washed through the structure at 4 a.m. Rescue workers couldn't get to the home, which was listed by crews as unstable, until Tuesday.
But they couldn't enter until Wednesday morning when crews stabilized the house. Wes Stockwell, the Mason County coroner, said Glenn died of asphyxiation and suffocation from chest injuries.
- A 57-year-old Aberdeen, Wash., man died after getting hit by a falling tree while clearing storm debris from his yard.
Richard Pearsall was pronounced dead from traumatic injuries, said Battalion Chief Damon Lillybridge of the Aberdeen Fire Department.
- An elderly Winlock, Wash., man is missing and presumed drowned after he slid into a creek and was whisked away in Lewis County.
Dive teams combed Wallers Creek after the man fell in during the afternoon after he was checking an outflow hose on a sump pump in the basement of his home. The man's name has not been released.
- Two hikers -- a 33-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man -- were killed by an avalanche near Snoqualmie Pass in King County, Wash.
A third hiker was rescued and flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he was in satisfactory condition.
- A man in Montesano, Wash., died when his oxygen equipment stopped operating after he lost electricity.
Details of the incident, including the man's name, were not available.
TUESDAY
- A 90-year-old woman from Warrenton was found dead in her home, apparently from falling and striking her face, said Dr. JoAnn Stefanelli, the Clatsop County medical examiner.
The woman was apparently responding to a window that had been blown out by heavy winds.
Stefanelli declined to release the victim's name because all her relatives may not have been notified in the post-storm confusion.
- In Yakima County, searchers found two missing Selah, Wash., men dead at Cleman Mountain near Naches.The men had gone out in search of one of the men's sons and a friend who were stuck in the snow.
Authorities said it appears their car went off a road and rolled down a slope.
WEDNESDAY
- Laura Steyaert, 73, of Tierra Del Mar in Tillamook County, was clearing storm debris from the property she shared with her 78-year-old husband, Raymond.
Raymond Steyaert thought his wife was in their home when he drove to their property's fire pit. He accidentally ran over her with his pickup.
- A 58-year-old Nehalem man who was helping his daughter and son-in-law clear storm debris from their Gearhart home died of an apparent heart attack Wednesday afternoon.
Stefanelli said the man, whose name won't be released until all his relatives are contacted about the incident, was helping remove downed trees.""" ;

<http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/02/mitt-romney-donald-trump-senate-utah/> dct:description """BOSTON (CBS) – Just a guess, but given his turbulent presidency, checkered past and interesting diet, President Donald Trump might occasionally have some interesting nightmares. But could Mitt Romney be his worst nightmare yet?
The former Massachusetts governor is considered odds-on favorite to win the seat being vacated by the retirement at year’s end of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. And to say the least, there’s no love lost between Romney and the president.
During the campaign, Trump repeatedly disparaged Romney, claiming at one point that the 2012 GOP presidential nominee had “choked like a dog.”
“Fraud” was one of the tamer adjectives Romney used to describe Trump.
And after the 2016 election, Trump gratuitously humiliated Romney by summoning him to New York to be interviewed for secretary of state before snubbing him. Since then, Romney hasn’t hesitated to express his low opinion of Trump’s leadership.
But the DC landscape Romney may enter a year from now could have a very different balance of power. If the Republicans do retain control of the Senate, it will likely be by a narrow margin; Romney’s vote could be instantly pivotal.
And while Romney is unlikely to be adversarial to most of the conservative GOP agenda, he might well be a more reliable vote against Trumpism than the outgoing likes of Bob Corker and Jeff Flake.
Plus, should Trump’s approval ratings continue to flounder in negative territory, is it impossible to imagine Romney, only a vigorous 73 years old by 2020, emerging as a top challenger to a Trump second term?
What goes around comes around, and Trump may come to regret his attacks on Romney. And for all of his Midwestern aw-shucks-ness, don’t forget that Romney spent most of his adult life living in Massachusetts, where there are three major pastimes: sports, politics and revenge.""" ;

<http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sneed-gage-park-massacre/> dct:description """DNA, phone records lead to charges in Gage Park massacre: police
DNA evidence and phone records put a 22-year-old Chicago man at the scene of a massacre of six Gage Park family members — an attack that started as a robbery, police said Thursday.
The details came as police announced charges against that man, Diego Uribe, and his girlfriend, Jafeth Ramos, 19. Each is charged with six counts of first-degree murder for the February slayings at the bungalow in the 5700 block of South California Avenue, authorities said.
Uribe is a nephew to one of the victims, Maria Herminia Martinez. Both he and Ramos allegedly gave statements implicating themselves to authorities.
Uribe and Ramos had planned to rob the family. The break in the case came when DNA evidence came back Wednesday linking him to the crime scene, as did Uribe’s cellphone records.
After he entered the home, Uribe confronted Maria Herminia Martinez on the first-floor of the home. Then they went upstairs. There, he shot her and then systematically beat and stabbed the other family members as he encountered them throughout the home, police said. Ramos was an “active participant” in the killings but did not shoot or stab any of the victims, police spokesman Anthony Gugliemi said.
There was already bad blood between Uribe and Maria Herminia Martinez, because the young man didn’t approve of her personal life, authorities said, although this wasn’t the primary motive.
The couple took a few hundred dollars, an Xbox and other valuables, police said.
In March, police gathered DNA evidence from Uribe and other family members as a routine part of the investigation.
Testing of DNA evidence came back showing it was Uribe’s blood that was found in the home, police said.
It took police 16 hours to process the crime scene for evidence, Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy said at a news conference Thursday, as he praised the team that investigated the case.
Ramos and Uribe were arrested Wednesday at the home they shared with Ramos’ parents, Cmdr. William Dunn said.
The pair had apparently continued on with their daily lives in the months after the killings and did not attempt to flee, Dunn said. Dunn did not know what Uribe intended to do with the money or why he allegedly decided to seek it from his aunt.
Chicago Police had long believed multiple killers were involved in the slayings.
Noemi Martinez, a relative of the family, said soon after the news of the arrests broke that she had heard of the charges in the case but didn’t know any details.
“Of course we’re happy,” she said. “We have been living in fear.”
Neighbor Martika Williams sat on her front stoop, relieved to know that police had caught the killers, but shocked at the identity of the suspects.
Uribe was a frequent visitor to the house, and a favorite of his young cousins, recalled Williams.
“[Uribe] played with those kids all the time. That family loved him,” she said. “This is not no random thing. This is someone that loved them kids, and those little kids loved him.”
In the days after the killing, Williams took care of the lone survivor of the Martinez household: the family pet, Pelusa, a shaggy mutt whose name is Spanish for “fluff.”
“I was concerned and I didn’t want to just give the dog over to no one, so the police asked me who in the family would I give it to,” Williams said, frowning. “And that was the first name I gave them: Diego.”
Police said Uribe had agreed to pick up the dog, but Williams said two women showed up to pick it up.
“I said I didn’t know them, and where was Diego,” she said. “I called his mom, and she said it was fine. He had a work thing he couldn’t get out of, and he was going to pick the dog up from them.
“That dog was already scared and upset. And I had no idea I was giving it over to the person that just killed its whole family in front of it.”
Supt. Eddie Johnson said the murders — a violent attack targeting a quiet, close-knit family, with victims ranging in age from 10 to 62 — shocked and frightened the Gage Park community and haunted police.
“For Chicago police officers and detectives, it became personal,” Johnson said. “The Martinez family weren’t repeat offenders or involved in any illegal activity. They were a family like any other, they went to work, they went school, loved each other and abided by the law.”
“I haven’t seen a case that has hit home as much for myself and so many others in this department as what was discovered on that cold day in February.”
The bodies of four adults and two children, ages 10 and 13, were found throughout the bungalow on Feb. 4 after a friend of Noe Martinez Jr., one of the victims, tipped police that the O’Hare Airport window cleaner hadn’t shown up for his job for two days.
Maria Herminia Martinez, whose body was found in a kneeling position in an upstairs bedroom, was shot four times in the head and in each of her hands. A source claims she may have been the main target. Martinez’s 13-year old son, Leonardo Cruz, suffered a dozen knife wounds. Noe Martinez Sr., 62, suffered 42 knife wounds all over his body. His wife, Rosaura, 58, had been stabbed in the abdomen five times. Alexis Cruz, 10, had been stabbed repeatedly, including three times in the heart.
The arrests in the case were first reported by Chicago Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed.
Cook County court records don’t show any prior adult charges involving Diego Uribe. Ramos was arrested by the Cicero police on Oct. 6, 2015, for allegedly shoplifting and was released on a $1,500 bond, court records show. A warrant was issued for her arrest when she didn’t appear in court.""" ;

The blast occurred in the garden of the Amara Cultural Centre, where at least 300 members of the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations (SGDF) were staying as part of a summer expedition to help build the nearby Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane.
The blast occurred just as the youth group were being filmed and chanting in solidarity with their mission to rebuild Kobane.
Warning: Graphic video showing the moment of the explosion
Moments after the explosion in Suruc, a second explosion detonated in Kobane at an old mortar warehouse.
Since September 2014, thousands of Syrians and Kurds from Kobane have found refuge in Suruc after fleeing from the fierce fighting between Islamic State (IS) militants and members of the Kurdish YPG in Kobane.

In January of 1888, the residents of Nebraska, Dakota Territory, Montana, Kansas, Wyoming, and even Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas were faced with a snowstorm unlike any they had seen before. Striking the majority of the region at the time school was dismissed, many students and teachers were caught long distances from home as the temperature dropped well below zero and visibility diminished. Striking the majority of the region at the time school was dismissed, it has become known as The Schoolchildren’s Blizzard. The disaster was forever ingrained in the minds of those who lived through it. By exploring different perspectives, a transformation of this storm and memory surfaces, fueled in large part by the attention newspapers put on school teachers at the time.
As a prominent institution on the Plains beginning in the middle-to-late 1800s, rural schools stood as a visualization of settlers’ commitment to education. Frequently consisting of one room, ideas of these buildings standing alone on the prairie give this educational tradition a romanticized image. The school systems, teachers, and students show a more complex and organized system, however, from which analyses of gender and class can be attained to show how they were perceived in local newspapers when their role of authority was put to the test during the January 12, 1888 blizzard.""" ;

The panic at "Love Parade 2010" left "many" injured, according to police, who declined to give a specific number because many of those injured were taken to hospitals around the country, including some who had to be airlifted.
Carsten Lueb of CNN affiliate NTV said that the number of injured was possibly into the hundreds.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a statement offering her condolences to the victims' families, saying "my sadness and empathy goes out to them."
"The young people came to celebrate; instead people were killed and injured," the statement said. "I am distraught and sad in the face of the suffering and pain."
Lueb told CNN that some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular festival, which features dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people.
The deadly crush happened in an underpass between the main event site and the expansion area. Witnesses told NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began as festival-goers began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other.
After the panic, a line of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site, carrying away people injured in the crush. The festival itself, however, went on. Police were afraid that ending the music altogether could cause further unrest among the massive crowd.
Witnesses also told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. NTV reported that there were 1,400 police officers on hand to monitor the event.
The festival was supposed to take place from 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) to midnight. By the evening, the entrance and adjacent roadway remained closed. Thousands inside the venue continued dancing, but many could be seen leaving the area.
The Love Parade was first held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1989.

<http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/mayerthorpe-remembers-1.306710> dct:description """Amanda Ferguson, ctvedmonton.ca
Thousands of people gathered in the small town of Mayerthorpe, Alta., Friday to wipe away the pain of tragedy and replace it with hope, pride and healing.
Organizers unveiled a $1.8-million park in tribute to the four RCMP officers who lost their lives in the March 2005 shooting.
About 1,600 people, along with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach and representatives from the RCMP, came together to witness the official opening of the park.
Mayerthorpe Fallen Four Memorial Society president Jurgen Preugschas said in his opening speech that the memorial will create a "living legacy of peaceful remembrance."
"The ongoing goal of this park is to show that beauty can return and sustain us," he said. "We all have a right and responsibly to move beyond grief."
He dedicated the park to every officer who has ever lost their life while in the line of duty.
Representatives from Kids for Cops, the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the RCMP and the Mayerthorpe Fallen Four Scoiety each individually unveiled the statues.
Const. Brock Myrol was the first statue to be unveiled -- his statue facing south towards his hometown of Red Deer.
Next was Const. Anthony Gordon, facing west towards his first detachment in Whitecourt, Alta. His statue stands in the "at ease" position.
Representatives then unveiled Const. Leo Johnston, his bronze statue facing north towards of his hometown of Lac La Biche. He stands at attention, ready for orders.
Const. Peter Schiemann was last to be unveiled, his statue facing east towards his hometown of Stony Plain. As the most experienced leader of the four, he gets the honour of standing in the saluting position.
One of the park's main orgainzers, Margaret Thibault, narrated each statue's unveiling, her voice wavering as she read each officer's name.
"These heroes died as four brothers," she said.
The Memorial
The members of the Fallen Four Society began raising the money for a memorial about one month after the March 2005 shooting.
Designers created the park to home five statues -- one for each fallen RCMP member and an obelisk in the centre of the park.
The seven-metre tall obelisk, capped with the forms of flying ducks, stands as a tribute to all officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty across Canada.
The grounds also include a day-use picnic area and playground.
The park cost $1.8 million to build. Provincial and federal governments contributed $730,000, and the balance was provided through fundraisers.
Thibault told the crowd that the heart of the community was unlocked when the four officers died.
"This work is a project from the heart and it is to be a testament to the esteem of each individual who gave their life to ensure the peace and safety of the citizens," she said. "It's a testament of our pride in all those who give their life. It embodies all that is good, all that is right."
Construction began in October 2006.
There are also walking paths to take visitors in and around the park and a gazebo.
A Terrible Tragedy
James Roszko, a violent cop-hater with a criminal record, shot the four officers to death on March 3, 2005, in Mayerthorpe, Alta. The tragedy was the national police force's worst single-day loss of life in more than a century.
Roszko ended up taking his own life after trading gunfire with other police officers.
The attack occurred as the four officers guarded a Quonset hut on Roszko's property.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the event heart-wrenching for all Canadians.
"It was a monstrous insult to all that is good and decent in the Canadian way of life," he said.
The Fallen Four
Const. Brock Myrol decided to become an RCMP officer three tears before his death.
He had worked as a security guard and studied towards an undergraduate arts degree from Red Deer College.
Born in Outlook, Sask., he came from a family that loved music.

<http://emersonpolling.com/2019/04/28/2020-texas-biden-and-beto-in-dead-heat-in-democratic-primary/> dct:description """A new Emerson Poll of Democratic Primary voters in Texas finds former Vice President Joe Biden at 23% and former Texas U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke at 22%. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was the only other candidate to clear double digits, polling third at 17%. Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8% and Senator Elizabeth Warren at 7% are ahead of former HUD secretary and native Texan Julian Castro, who is at 4%. The poll was conducted April 25-28, 2019, mixed mode, of Democratic primary voters with n=342, +/- 5.3%.
Spencer Kimball, Director of the Emerson Poll, explains “it seems that Beto O’Rourke does not have Texas locked up. Bernie Sanders had trouble back in 2016 in southern states, including losing Texas by 32 points (65% to 33%) to Hillary Clinton, so it will be exciting to see who can capture the Lone Star state in next March’s key Super Tuesday contest.”
Continuing the trend found in other Emerson polls this year, voters aged 18-29 continue to break more for Sanders than any other candidate, with 34% of their vote. O’Rourke leads among those age 30-49 with 31%, and Biden leads among 50-64 year olds with 29%, and among 65+ year olds with 36%.
O’Rourke does best with Hispanic voters, receiving 32% of their support. O’Rourke and Biden lead among white voters with 22% support each. Biden also leads among black voters with 40% support.
President Trump has a 46% approval/44% disapproval in Texas. However, he remains popular within his party, leading Republican opponent former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld 87% to 13%. (n=344, +/-5.3%). This is consistent with other Emerson polls conducted in different states over the past several months.
Head to Heads:
In general election matchups, Trump is in statistical dead heats with four of the top six Democratic opponents, and leads the other two. In a Donald Trump versus Joe Biden matchup, the two are almost exactly even at 50% for Biden and 49% for Trump. Beto O’Rourke versus Trump is very similar, with 50% going to Beto and 50% supporting Trump. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the other Democrats within the margin, with Trump receiving 51% to Sanders’ 49% and Trump leading Warren 53% to 47%. The rest fall outside of the margin, with Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg each receiving 46% support to Trump’s 54%.
Marijuana
Despite the state’s current strict marijuana policies, a plurality (38%) of Texans support full legalization, 35% support marijuana use for medical purposes only, 13% would like it decriminalized, and 14% said it should remain illegal.
Kimball notes: “It looks like Texas is headed, at the very least to medical marijuana in the near future. Among Democrats, 54% support full legalization compared to 27% who prefer medical uses only, and among Republicans, 44% opt for medical purposes only as compared to 22% who support full legalization. Independents are split on the issue with 39% supporting legalization and 35% supporting it for medical purposes only; even among Republicans only 24% said they wanted to keep it totally illegal.”
As expected, younger voters 18-29 prefer legalization 59% to 21% for medical purposes. Among older voters (those over 65), 45% agreed for medical purposes only, and 17% supported full legalization.
US Senate
In a potential 2020 U.S. Senate Race between Senator John Cornyn and former House candidate M.J. Hegar, the GOP incumbent Senator leads with 29% and Hegar is at 12%, 16% prefer someone else, and 44% are unsure of their choice. Kimball adds, “It is clear that Hegar has some work to do to sow up party support, as Hegar gets only 25% of the Democratic voters, while 50% of the Dems are unsure.” Kimball continues, “On the other hand, Cornyn is getting 52% of Republican voters, with only 34% of GOP voters unsure.”
Caller ID
The Texas Emerson College poll was conducted April 25-28, 2019 under the Supervision of Professor Spencer Kimball. The sample consisted of registered voters, n=799, with a Credibility Interval (CI) similar to a poll’s margin of error (MOE) of +/- 3.4 percentage points. The data was weighted based on a 2016 voter model of race, region, mode, age. It is important to remember that subsets based on gender, age, party breakdown, ethnicity and region carry with them higher margins of error, as the sample size is reduced. Data was collected using both an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system of landlines only (n=559) and an online panel provided by Amazon Turk (n=240). Visit our website at ​www.emersonpolling.com​.

<http://en.a1plus.am/1184325.html> dct:description """In the last few weeks, a dozen Members of Congress released statements and made speeches on the House floor in commemoration of the 26th anniversary of the anti-Armenian pogroms in Sumgait, Kirovabad and Baku, Azerbaijan, reported the Armenian Assembly of America (Assembly).
“On this tragic anniversary, when we mourn the loss of those innocent lives, we are mindful of the ongoing conflict in Nagorno Karabakh and recurrent incidents of inciting rhetoric by Azeri political leaders and continued military clashes along the border,” stated House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA). “It is critical that Azerbaijan’s leaders refrain from provocative statements and commit to fruitful negotiations for a lasting peace in Nagorno Karabakh,” Royce said.
Beginning in Sumgait in 1988, and spreading to the cities of Kirovabad in 1989 and Baku and 1990, armed mobs of Azerbaijani citizens took to the streets targeting Armenian residences and destroying Armenian-owned businesses while Azerbaijan security services stood by. As a result, thousands of Armenians were injured and countless more fled their homes, effectively cleansing Azerbaijan of its Christian Armenian minority.
As a wave of pro-Azerbaijan lawmakers has tried to bolster the autocratic regime in recent years, the Assembly has been working to educate Members of Congress and the public about the Armenian pogroms that took place. As previously reported, the Assembly distributed its report “SUMGAIT: The Public Record” to Congress and continues to work with the Armenian Caucus on this critically important issue.
Drawing parallels between events from 25 years ago, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) recounted that “This month also marked the 10th anniversary of the heinous murder of Armenian Army Lieutenant Gurgen Margaryan at a NATO training camp in Budapest, by Ramil Safarov, a Lieutenant of the Azerbaijani Army.” “Safarov used an axe to hack Margaryan to death while he was sleeping,” Sherman said, and “after being convicted of murder by Hungarian courts, he was transferred to Azerbaijan where he was immediately pardoned and given a hero’s welcome.” According to Sherman’s statement, “Several Azerbaijan government officials have hailed Safarov’s actions as patriotism. This is unacceptable, and the international community should hold Azerbaijan accountable for this,” he said, illustrating how Azerbaijan’s leaders have pushed a discriminatory and intolerant agenda toward their Armenian neighbors.
“On behalf of the entire Armenian American community, I thank Senator Kirk and Representatives Royce, Schiff, Sherman, Pallone, Eshoo, Clark, Cicilline, Cardenas, Chu, Sanchez, and Peters for their principled stand on human rights issues and for sending a strong message to Azerbaijan about its anti-Armenian policies,” stated Assembly Executive Director Bryan Ardouny.""" ;

<http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ahmed,_Justice_Shahabuddin> dct:description """Shahabuddin Ahmed
Ahmed, Justice Shahabuddin President of Bangladesh. Shahabuddin Ahmed was born on 1 February 1930 at village Pemal under Kendua thana of Netrakona district. His father Talukdar Resat Ahmed Bhuiyan was a renowned social worker and philanthropist. Shahabuddin Ahmed obtained the degree of BA (Hons) in Economics in 1951 and MA in International Relations in 1952 from Dhaka University. He entered the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP) in 1954 through a competitive examination, successfully completed training at the Lahore Civil Service Academy and attended a special course on Public Administration in the University of Oxford.
After serving for sometime as a magistrate and then as sub-divisional officer of Gopalganj and Natore, Shahabuddin Ahmed was promoted to the post of additional deputy commissioner. He was transferred to the judicial branch in June 1960 thus ending his career in the executive branch of administration. He served as additional district and sessions judge in Dhaka and Barisal and as district and sessions judge of Comilla and Chittagong. In 1967, Ahmed was appointed Registrar of the Dhaka High Court.
He was elevated to the bench as a judge of the High Court of Bangladesh on 20 January 1972. On deputation he served as chairman of the Labour Appellate Tribunal (1973-74). Thereafter he returned to the High Court Division as a judge.
Shahabuddin Ahmed was appointed a judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on 7 February 1980. A great number of his verdicts have been reported in the Dhaka Law Reports, Bangladesh Legal Decisions and Bangladesh Case Reports. Some of his judgements on service matters, election disputes and labour-management relations have been highly appreciated. His verdict on the 8th Amendment of the Constitution of Bangladesh was hailed as a landmark in the constitutional development of the country. Here, among other things, he criticised the tendency of the Third World dictatorships to abrogate the constitutions for self-aggrandisement and coterie-rule under the thin veneer of democracy, for curtailing fundamental human rights, violation of human rights, challenge to people's sovereignty, denial of the independence of the judiciary, and substituting rule by fiat in place of rule of law. He also deplored the curtailing of the traditional powers of the High Court in matters like appointment, promotion, transfer, leave and control of subordinate judiciary by the executive branch of the state.
Justice Shahabuddin was the chairman of the Commission of Enquiry constituted to enquire into the causes of police firing on the agitating students of Dhaka University in mid-February of 1983 causing death of several students and injury to many more. But his report submitted after extensive enquiry was never made public by the then government. He was chairman of the National Pay Commission in 1984 when upward revision of pay-scales was made on the basis of his report. He served as chairman of Bangladesh Red Cross Society from August 1978 to April 1982. He attended the International Appellate Judge's Conference held in Washington DC in September 1990.
Shahabuddin Ahmed was appointed Chief Justice of Bangladesh on 14 January 1990. A peaceful revolution took place in the country in early December 1990 following public agitation led by opposition political parties for changing the autocratic system of government and for resignation of the government headed by President H M Ershad. Consequently on 6 December 1990 the then Vice-President Moudud Ahmed resigned and Chief Justice Shahabuddin was appointed Vice-President. On that very day H M Ershad resigned and handed over power to Shahabuddin Ahmed who became the head of the government as acting President of the country. He formed a caretaker government with neutral non-political persons and held a free and fair election in the country in February 1991. During this period, he gave back freedom of the press by amending a number of law including the Special Powers Act. Thereafter on the election and entering into office of the new President, Shahabuddin Ahmed resumed his duties on 10 October 1991 as the Chief Justice from which office he retired on 1 February 1995.
Justice Shahabuddin was elected the President of the country unopposed on 23 July 1996 having been nominated by the Awami League government. He was sworn-in as the President on 9 October 1996. Although a mere figurehead in a parliamentary form of government, he earned the love, respect and admiration of all segments of population of Bangladesh due to his neutral and conscientious role in all state affairs during the five years of his Presidency. He retired from the Presidency on 14 November 2001. [Kazi Ebadul Hoque and Helal Uddin Ahmed]""" ;

A press conference is expectedly shortly at the Troika Palace.
Shots were fired near the Tunisian parliament and the adjacent Bardo museum on Wednesday afternoon, prompting police to rush reinforcements to the area, an AFP photographer reported.
The gunfire prompted parliamentary committees to suspend their meetings as lawmakers were ordered to assemble in the main chamber, Islamist MP Monia Brahim told AFP.
The BBC said MPs were discussing counter-terrorism legislation when the parliament was attacked and they were later evacuated.

<http://epress.am/en/2016/12/19/appeals-court-upholds-life-sentence-for-russian-soldier-convicted-of-murder-of-armenian-family.html> dct:description """The Appeals Court in Yerevan, presided over by judge Mher Aghamanyan, upheld on Monday a lower court verdict sentencing Russian soldier Valery Permyakov to life in prison for the murder of a Gyumri family of seven in January, 2015. The court also denied the victims’ relatives motion demanding 450,000 euros as compensation from Russia.
Six members of the Avetisyans’ family, including a 2-year-old girl, were found shot to death in their house on January 12; the family’s seventh member, a 6-month-old boy who had been stabbed with a bayonet, died a week later in hospital.
Permyakov, a 19-year-old serviceman of the local Russian military base, was detained the following day near the Armenian-Turkish border and handed over to Russian military officials by Russian border guards. The latter stimulated a protest of thousands of people in Gyumri who demanded that the investigation of the case and Permyakov’s trial be conducted by Armenian authorities. Months later, Russia finally agreed that Permyakov be tried by the Shirak district court of first instance.
During the course of the trial, which ended on August 23,2016, the lawyers for the victims’ legal successors announced multiple times that Armenian officials had failed to conduct a complete investigation, failing therefore to establish the actual motives behind the crime.
Prominent Armenian human rights activist Artur Sakunts, the head of the Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly Vanadzor office (HCAV) and a representative for the the victims’ next of kin, went ahead and appealed the verdict, insisting that the crime itself had not been fully revealed and that he was not convinced that Permyakov had acted alone. Sakunts also alleged that “the Avetisyans’ might not have been the actual targets” of the gruesome crime.
Speaking to Epress.am on Monday, Arayik Zalyan, a lawyer with HCAV, called the Appeals Court ruling “predictable,” stressing that Armenian authorities’ conduct in relation with the case had not been very promising from the get-go.
“Neither the investigative body, nor the first instance court did anything to actually discover the case, so we did not expect Mher Aghamanyan’s court to issue a favourable verdict,” Zalyan said. He added that they will turn to the European Court of Human Rights if the Court of Cassation does not overturn the ruling either.""" ;

The Dutch artist spoke to RTL Boulevard and shed more light on her thoughts about next year’s Eurovision host city race.
Getty Kaspers won the Eurovision Song Contest 44 years ago with the song Ding-a-Dong. Now that Duncan Laurence has taken Getty off the throne, the competition will be held in the Netherlands.
Getty was the lead singer of Dutch band Teach In who won the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm, thus giving the Netherlands its fourth Eurovision victory.
Rotterdam is the ideal host city for Getty Kaspers
According to Kaspers, Amsterdam should not be organizing the festival, but rather Rotterdam, she tells RTL Boulevard.
According to Getty, it is important that the Netherlands show a different city than Amsterdam. She also thinks it is important that the Netherlands earns some money by organizing the Eurovision Song Contest, and although she really likes Maastricht, she would rather not see the city take on the organization.
The reason for this is that she fears that Germany will benefit a lot from all visitors and that Dutch hotels will miss out on guests. According to her, Rotterdam is extremely suitable for organizing the Eurovision Song Contest.
Duncan Laurence & Esther Hart also support Rotterdam
She thus joins the 2o19 Dutch Eurovision winner Ducan Laurence who also prefers to see the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest held in Rotterdam and Esther Hart (Netherands 2003) who is also lobbying for her hometown Rotterdam. Whilst the internationally acclaimed conductor Andre Rieu is all set to bring the competition to his hometown Maastricht.
Rotterdam is vying to host the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest at the Rotterdam Ahoy and is one of the frontrunners along with Amsterdam and Maastricht to win the bid.
The 2020 Eurovision Host City Bid Process
In total there are nine cities or regions that have signed up for the organization of the Eurovision Song Contest next year:
Amsterdam
Rotterdam
The Hague
Utrecht
Maastricht / Limburg
Arnhem
Breda
Den Bosch
Leeuwarden / Friesland.
Other cities that also want to give it a try can still submit a bidbook. All proposals must be submitted to the organzing body by 10 July 2019 at the latest.
The candidate cities have recently received all the criteria that must be met. Cities are assessed on, among other things, the available location, capacity and technical facilities, accommodation, infrastructure and accessibility. The organization wants to announce the final choice of the host city in August.
The 2020 Eurovision Song Contest will be co-produced by three Dutch public broadcasters NOS, AVROTROS and NPO in liason with the EBU""" ;

Yesterday NPO announced the names of the two shortlisted cities vying to host the forhcoming 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands.
NPO’s Eurovision Committe travelled to Maastricht today in order to hold a technical meeting with the city’s officials. They were welcomed by the Mayor of Maastricht, Mr. Van de Wiel (Director of MECC) and Ms. Inge Dovermann (ESC Maastricht Project Leader).
The focus of the visit mainly concentrated on the city of Maastricht, the venue and its facilities. The local media was not allowed to attend the meeting but were given a chance to meet the city’s officials and ESC 2020 Committee later.
Sietse Bakker (Executive Producer ESC 2020) was quite impressed with Maastrcht’s ethuasiasm and bid after visiting the city along with the 2020 ESC Committee (NPO/NOS/AVROTROS):
The MECC is a good, fantastic location with many options. You could host a great Eurovision here. I am pleasantly surprised by the enthusiasm in Maastricht. It is really amazing!
Regarding Maastricht’s potential venue Bakker adds:
In terms of height, width and depth, the hall in the MECC is reminiscent of the venues in Kiev and Tel Aviv. This makes it challenging!
Bakker concludes:
They really want to have the contest here in Maastricht. In both cities we look at the suitability of the location, what the city itself contributes and which accommodations are available. Rotterdam and Maastricht both meet these three points.
The 2020 Eurovision Committee was given a virtual tour of the main Eurovision venue at MECC, showcasing the hall set up with a stage for hosting Eurovision through virtual reality glasses.
Mr. Van de Wiel (MECC Director) says:
They wanted us to move the stage a little, because the logistics around the stage are much larger. So we have to go back to the drawing table.
Tomorrow the 2020 Eurovision Committee will be travelling to Rotterdam in order to check the city’s potential Eurovision venue and infrastructure.

The meeting was incredibly substantive. First we went through the bidbook in great detail, we presented ourselves as a city and toured the premises. We spent a few hours discussing various ideas regarding the different spaces and halls.
The staff and management of the Rotterdam Ahoy has worked very hard on preparing their Eurovision bid, and put in a lot of effort to tackle the requirements to host the competition. Rotterdam Ahoy has been in contact with former Eurovision host cities: Tel Aviv, Stockholm, Vienna and Lisbon in order to get more feedback on the organization of the event.
Jansen adds:
We’ve been doing a lot of homework lately, for example we have been in touch with some of the former Eurovision venues and host cities which have organized the contest in recent years, such as Stockholm, Vienna and Lisbon. It was very good to discuss all these things with each other. A very important lesson is that all of this is greater than anything that I have ever experienced.
The City of Rotterdam is also very enthuasiastic about bringing the competition on home soil if it wins he bid.
Mr. Said Kasmi (Rotterdam Councilor for Culture) says:
We might soon host the biggest music competition, I suppose there will be 246 million viewers worldwide watching the show. All eyes that will be focused on Rotterdam and we will have lots of visitors landing in the city. We are working hard so that everything falls into place.
Rotterdam hosted the Junior ESC some years ago, NPO has not forgotten that.
Mr. Sietse Bakker (Eurovision 2020 Executive Producer) says:
The EBU has had a very good experience with the 2007 Junior Song Contest here. I think that certainly counts. Ahoy is a very nice location for three very spectacular TV shows. There are many spaces and halls in close proximity to the main hall that can house the press, delegations, production and technical teams etc.
The 2020 Eurovision Host City is expected to be unveiled by mid August.

Many Eurovision fans will be dissapointed to learn that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will not participate at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest next year either.
Thus Luxembourg joins Andorra, Slovakia and Bosnia & Herzegovina in the list of countries who have so far confirmed that they will not return to the competition in 2020.
The 5-time Eurovision champion nation withdrew from the competition in 1994 and has not returned since.
RTL told ESCToday that it currently concentrates on news features rather than music and entertainment shows. A Eurovision participation would entail a financial strain on the broadcaster, hence the country has no plans to return to the contest at the moment.
Luxembourg in Eurovision
Luxembourg debuted at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1956 and is one of the founder members of the competition along with Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. The landlocked country has won the contest on five occasions (1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983) and has partaken 37 times in the competition.
The duchy is well known for having sent many international artists to Eurovision; Lara Fabian, Ireen Sheer, Baccara, Nana Mouskouri, Vicky Leandros, Anne Marie David, France Gall, etc.
The last time the country graced the Eurovision stage was back in 1993 when Modern Times flew the Luxembourgish flag in Millstreet with Donnez moi un chance de te dire.""" ;

Monaco debuted at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1959 and has partaken in the contest 24 times. The tiny principality has won the competition once, namely in 1971 when Severine was crowned the winner in Dublin with her entry Un banc, un arbre, une rue.
The country competed in the contest religiously every year from 1959- 1979, then in 1980 it decided to withdraw from the competition and stayed out until 2004 when it decided to return when the semi-final was introduced.

Safety and Security Plan
Side Events Program and Locations
Accomodation and Hotel Capacity
Infrastructure and Logistics to hold Eurovision

It’s official! Rotterdam has chosen the venue for the 2020 Euroclub, Rotterdam City Councilor Mr. Said Kasmi has unveiled the location for the Euroclub in Rotterdam during a press lunch today. The club will operate during the main Eurovision week and will host the ESC afterparties and other ESC related events.
Maassilo is located on Rotterdam’s waterfront at Maashaven Zuidzijde, just a 10 minute’s drive from the Eurovision venue, Rotterdam Ahoy.
The venue consists of several large halls and is the perfect place to host a party: Grand Hall, Middle Hall, Small Hall, Kelder etc.
The City of Rotterdam will house the 2020 Euroclub at the Maassilo, a multi purpose event venue which can accomodate up to 5,000 persons.

About Maassilo
The Maassilo is a former grain silo and grain elevator in the Rotterdam Maashaven that has been in use since 2004 as a place of entertainment and an event location.
The oldest part of the silo, which was largely constructed from reinforced concrete, was completed in 1911 and then contained 128 silos with a total capacity of 20,000 tonnes of grain. A second part was completed in 1930, right next to the oldest part, and in 1951 a final expansion took place.
In 1986, 70 people were still working at Maashaven Silo BV, but that number subsequently dropped due to EU measures aimed at stimulating the use of European grains, so that there was less demand for the grain supplied to the port of Rotterdam.
Around 2000 it was decided to move the grain storage to a newer part of the port. Since 2004, the Maassilo has been used as an entertainment location and event location, initially (until the end of 2006) by the Now & Wow nightclub.
A multi-company building was opened in 2008 on the front side of the building in which various creative entrepreneurs live.
The Maassilo also laid the foundations for the first Dutch song festival victory after 44 years. In a studio in this building the song Arcade was made with which Duncan Laurence won the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv in 2019.
The Euroclub
The 2019 Euroclub will be housed at Maassilo, one of Rotterdam’s most fashionable night spots and will run from 08- 16 May 2020 (potential dates). The Euroclub will operate daily.
Access to the Euroclub will be restricted to accredited fans, journalists, delegations and artists and will not be open to the general public.
Artists, accredited media and press, accredited fans and delegations will be able to party and unwind at the Euroclub after a hard day’s work schedule and dance away to the early hours of the morning. Rotterdam is all set to party Eurovision style come May!
The 2020 Eurovision Song Contest is scheduled to be held on 12, 14 and 16 May at the Rotterdam Ahoy in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""" ;

Last week RTCG confirmed to ESCToday that Montenegro had withdrawn from Eurovision 2020, after having worked its level best to be present in Rotterdam and surpassing an extension granted by the EBU in order to confirm its participation.
The Montenegrin broadcaster has decided to pull out of the contest in 2020 due to poor results and the financial constraints entailing participation.
RTCG’s Director General Mr. Bozidar Sundic has decided that Montenegro will not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam next year.
According to the management of RTCG, the Montenegrin national broadcaster must act responsibly and purposefully spend the funds it receives from the budget.
RTCG’s relased the following statement:
The Eurovision Song Contest participation costs around € 130,000 each year. Our representatives have mostly achieved modest results, hardly qualifying to the Grand Final. So this year we have decided to invest that money in the RTCG fleet renewal. The plan is to buy five new cars, whhich will significantly improve the safety of our crews, who exceed over 1,000 kilometers every day.
Montenegro in Eurovision
Montenegro debuted at the Eurovision Song Contest as a solo country in 2007 with Stefan Faddy and is yet to win the competition. The country achieved its best results in the contest in 2015 with Knez‘s Balkan ballad Adio.
The former Yugoslav republic has only made it to the Eurovision Grand Final on two occasions, namely in 2014 and 2015. The Balkan country has competed in Europe’s favourite television show 11 times.
In 2019 Montenegro selected its Eurovision hopeful and entry for Tel Aviv via its traditional national final Montevizija. D Mol were crowned the winners of Montevizija 2019 and were awarded the golden ticket to Israel with their entry Heaven. Despite a great peformance the Montenegro failed to qualify to the Grand Final for the fourth consecutive year.""" ;

One of the only surviving boats during the Eyemouth Fishing Disaster of 1881, the Ariel Gazelle was thought lost to sea but after a gruelling two days at sea during the storm the boat returned to Eyemouth with all crew.

by Kevin J. Mullen
The Golden Dragon restaurant on Washington Street was the scene of an attack in 1977 that killed five and wounded eleven people.

Traditionally, the sale of illegal fireworks was a major source of gang revenue in Chinatown. As the Fourth of July approached each year, young people would stream into the district from all over the Bay Area to score firecrackers and other forbidden pyrotechnics. In 1977, the Ping Boys, residents of the Ping Yuen projects on Pacific Avenue, ran the operation under the auspices of the Wah Ching, for 10% of the take. On July 4, figuring to get their share of the accumulated loot, a group of Joe Boys headed for the Ping Yeun Projects with a view to robbing the Ping Boys of the proceeds from the sales. By this time, Joe Fong himself had been in prison for several years and though he was no longer on the street to exercise direct control of the gang, his followers continued to be referred to as “Joe Boys.”

The Joe Boys could not find a parking place nearby, and, as they approached the projects on foot, they were spotted by their enemies. In the ensuing gun battle on Pacific Avenue, one Joe Boy, Felix Louie, was killed and four others were wounded. The Joe Boys believed that Wah Ching leader Michael “Hot Dog” Louie had been the architect of their defeat. They retired to plan their revenge.
The Joe Boys nursed their wounded feelings for three months and then, in the early morning hours of Sunday, September 4, 1977, tipped off that Michael Louie was present in the Golden Dragon Restaurant on Washington Street, they attacked. (Although Louie was there, most of the gang was out of town in Northern California.) As three masked armed men entered the restaurant, Louie saw them coming and hit the floor. The shooters sprayed the restaurant with fire from shotguns and semi-automatic weapons, killing five innocent bystanders and wounding 11 more in the fusillade. The Golden Dragon Restaurant, significantly enough, was owned by the Hop Sing Tong whose youth faction, the Hop Sings Boys, were sometimes allied with the Wah Ching.
The press reaction was as might be expected. It was one thing for gangsters to kill one another in occasional street shootings; it was quite another thing to shoot down innocent bystanders in a public restaurant. The public was aroused, and called for action.
One week later, “Joe Boy” Yee Michael Lee was killed, and an associate was wounded in what was thought to be a reprisal attack by the Wah Ching at a Richmond District residence. It was then that the “Chinatown Squad” was re-established as a separate unit in the Police Department. This time, in deference to late Twentieth-Century-sensibilities, the unit was called “The Gang Task Force,” an appropriate omnibus term, as things turned out...
The first order of business was to solve the Golden Dragon Massacre, and the full resources of the unit were devoted to that purpose. Mayor George Moscone offered an unprecedented $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.

By late September, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce reported that Chinatown business had dropped off by 50 percent. The community and political pressure to make arrests mounted, as the days wore on. Radio journalist Russ Coughlin reminded everyone that just five years earlier the police had begun to get tough on the gangs with sweeps to prevent fights between warring factions, but had been forced off because of pressure from Chinatown after a few complaints that business was being harmed.
What followed in 1977 was what was probably the most complicated, sophisticated investigation in the annals of San Francisco crime. Over the next several months, investigators from the Gang Task Force, working with individual brilliance and masterfully orchestrated common efforts, pieced together the full story. Working in a bilingual, bicultural environment in a community famous for its reluctance to share information with outsiders, the officers identified and eventually brought to justice the perpetrators of the massacre.

From the get-go, officers who had been working Chinatown crime realized that the Golden Dragon Massacre had been an attempted hit by the Joe Boys on the Wah Ching leadership. And, by the end of October, they had the names of the shooters. Admittedly, the information was obtained from a questionably erratic informant who was, himself, up to his ears in gang violence. To keep lines of information open, the police had to keep that information quiet.
There is a great difference between “knowing” something and obtaining enough information to make an arrest and, even more so, to gain a conviction. Amazingly, the investigators were able to keep the identity of the informer—and even the fact that there was an informer—out of the news. The slightest hint of the existence of an informer and the investigation would have been fatally compromised.
Over the next several months, Task Force investigators prowled Chinatown and other locations where the young gangsters hung out, creating the impression of a ubiquitous, all-seeing police presence. Predictably, Chinatown “youth advocates”—one of whom turned out to have been a close associate with the Joe Boys—again voiced their disapproval. In the aftermath of the massacre, however, their concerns did not gain much traction. (This particular “youth” advocate was later arrested himself in the course of the Golden Dragon investigation as one of a group selling explosives to an Alcohol Tax and Firearms agent.)
The legend of a taciturn Chinese “wall of silence” is—as is much myth and legend—rooted in reality. Jake Gittes, Jack Nicholson’s character in the 1974 movie Chinatown was right: “You can’t always tell what’s going on.” But there are limits to that characterization. “If you spend the time with them,” says retired Sergeant Dan Foley, who spent 24 years on the Chinese Gang Task Force, first as a member, and then from 1986 as its head, “and make the effort to get to know them, the Chinese will come to trust you, and take you into their confidence.” Beyond that, says Foley, the gangsters are more than willing to give information about opposing gangs, if you play them right.
By patiently developing relationships in Chinatown with these methods, the Gang Task Force was able to gather together the little pieces of the puzzle, which, when skillfully woven together, encased the perpetrators in an unbreakable evidentiary web. An indispensable feature of the investigation was the participation of officers familiar with Chinese culture, like Fred Lau and Heather Fong—and later in Gang Task Force investigations, Felix Thieu—who were able to translate documents and offer insights not normally understood by non-Asian investigators.

A Noe Valley native, McKenna joined the Department in 1954 and was assigned to the Homicide Detail in 1969 when the Chinatown gang killings started in earnest. He was assigned Chinese homicide cases from the start and was a founding member of the Gang Task Force. From 1978 until his retirement in November 1986, he was the officer-in-charge of the Asian Section. (Photo courtesy of John McKenna)
In the end, the three shooters, the drivers on the night of the massacre, and assorted accessories prior to and after the crime, were arrested and convicted of assorted charges from first degree homicide on down.
Even as the investigation proceeded, gang violence in the schools in the Fall of 1977 continued. There were two further gang killings in 1977, that of Johnny Lee in late September, and Stephen Kong in November. But this time the Gang Task Force had the resources to stay on top of the situation. Perhaps one consequence of their efforts and the effect of the convictions was that, while gang conflicts persisted, the Chinese gang homicide rate declined. In all of 1978 there was only one gang killing in Chinatown, that of Louie Sing at 1018 Columbus in April. The Joe Boys continued their gang activities after the Golden Dragon arrests, but their numbers were sorely depleted and the mean age of the membership declined even further.
At first, in the 1960s many of the gang kids were immigrants who brought gang behaviors learned on the streets of Hong Kong with them and found it difficult to fit in. By the late 1970s most of the gang kids were recruited from the schools among American-born Chinese, or immigrant children who had come to the U.S. too young to have had any Triad connections in the old country. After the Golden Dragon Massacre, with the Joe Boy leadership in jail, control of the Joe Boys devolved onto younger high-school-age members. There was some Joe Boy activity then, but it gradually withered away.

<http://geoffreybillettphotography.com/blog/spanish-civil-war-san-jose-cemetery-malaga/> dct:description """Saturday • September 24, 2011 • by Geoff Billett
San Rafael cemetery can be found on the western edges of Malaga, almost as far west as the airport. It is no longer in use and is locked. A high wall of concrete, stone, metal and brick surrounds it. Large blocks of flats overlook it but it mostly butts onto light industrial workshops and large shops. Right behind it are some houses where people still live. Most remains of graves have been removed apart from an area close to the pits where flats overlook. It is mostly a wasteland of mud, scrub and some cypress trees. The cemetery is now a site recently excavated under ‘Historical Memory’ laws within Spain introduced by the recent Labour government who have wrestled with the legacy of Franco and have tried, against much opposition from the church and the Right, to reconcile some of the many wrongs which happened under Franco.
In the cemetery, the only evidence of recent organised activity is a series of plaques within detailing the ‘fosas’ or pits where excavations have occurred and where skeletons were uncovered.
Around 4,500 people were executed in San Rafael cemetery by Franco forces in the period 1936 to 1957, some of them removed to other burial sites. The ages of the victims were generally between 20 years and 40 years, although the remains of around 400 children have also been found, mostly sons of Republicans.
In February 2011 I visited Malaga and Granada to document specifically Civil War atrocity sites, of which San Rafael was one. I gained entry through a small hole in the wall at the side of the cemetery and began walking across the inner landscape. I was aware of potentially being watched from the high rise flats surrounding the cemetery or from any security patrols which might have occurred and was preparing my explanations to the police should I have been caught. After an hour of exploration I found the area where the ‘fosas’ or pits were located and stayed for a few minutes before making my way back to the hole I had scrambled through earlier.
The initial photographs document the exterior walls of the cemetery and the later photographs are from inside, the last two photographs depicting the scenes of excavation and exhumation several years before.

To commemorate this banner year, Charly Friedrichs AKA Final Kid has created a stunning 4K tribute to the festival, featuring scenes from the memorable weekend in Bayfront Park and a sensational soundtrack by way of Kidnap Kid's "Moments". Friedrichs said, “For me as a filmmaker it’s all about capturing the “MOMENTS” in the most cinematic way and then pairing it with the right soundtrack to transcend the experience. That’s what this clip is all about and it’s a good visual taster of what is to come in the official aftermovie later this summer!” The short film places a virtual bookend on one of the most outstanding years in the brand's storied history, and beautifully outlines the unique and timeless draw of Ultra Music Festival.

<http://glasgowdailytimes.com/local/x211927706/Storm-leaves-damage-in-its-wake> dct:description """The storm that ripped through Barren County this afternoon left many in the city and county without power because of downed trees and power lines.
Capt. Kent Keen, public information officer for the Glasgow Police Department, provided a storm damage report as of 3:45 p.m. Tuesday from the 911 Dispatch Center for streets, roads and other areas of Glasgow and Barren County.
Damage made some roads dangerous or impassable including U.S. 31E south near Lecta-Salem Road, West Washington and Jefferson streets, North Franklin and Water streets, Milton Avenue and Walnut Street, Cherry Street, Riverside Drive, Coral Hill and Franks Mill roads, Lucas Road, Cool Springs Road, Carden Road and Country Acres.
The Glasgow Electric Plant Board had an automated message at 3:15 p.m. that stated there were power outages and lines down throughout the city and repairs were expected to take some time.
Jerry Carter, spokesperson at Farmers Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation, said they had 1,950 customers without power because the transmission feed was lost to the Goodnight substation on 31E. Service was restored to the station at 3:15 p.m., but there was still a circuit that feeds into Glasgow that was out.
There was also structural damage to the circuit where it crosses Beaver Creek, Carter said.
On Cumberland Parkway near mile marker 6, debris from a barn on Bishop Road knocked down power lines that along with the barn’s roof blocked all four lanes for 45 minutes to an hour.
A tobacco warehouse on North Jackson Road had its roof blown off as well said Tony Richey, emergency management director for Barren County.
“We didn't have anyone report (a tornado) on the ground,” he said.
Gary Fancher, manager of Kentucky Division of Emergency Management for Region Four, reported numerous trees and power lines down in Allen, Hart, Metcalfe and Monroe counties, and approximately 500 customers in Horse Cave without power at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.
The only tornado reported locally was in the Huff community in Edmonson County, said Trooper Charles Swiney, spokesman for Kentucky State Police in Bowling Green.
Power was out in downtown Glasgow for some time leading to the cancellation of tonight's scheduled Barren Fiscal Court meeting. The meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday at 5 p.m.
The storm also led to the Western Kentucky University-Glasgow Campus closing for the rest of the day Tuesday.""" ;

<http://glasgowdailytimes.com/local/x211927760/Trees-power-lines-downed-by-storm> dct:description """GLASGOW — Local power companies had restored electricity to most of their customers in the Glasgow and Barren County area by Wednesday morning.
A storm that blew through the area knocked out power to homes and businesses served by Farmer’s Rural Electric Cooperative and the Glasgow Electric Plant Board. It also took down several trees and power lines throughout the area.
Bill Anderson, customer relations manager for Glasgow EPB, did not have a total number of customers Wednesday morning who were without power due to the storm.
“We had power problems all over town,” he said. “It was not any one section. It was everywhere.”
At press time Glasgow EPB was reporting 22 customers without power, five of which were businesses.
“We want to get people’s power back on as soon as possible,” Anderson said, adding that once that task is done the EPB will turn its attention to restoring other services, such as cable television, telephone and Internet.
“We did get one break earlier this morning. We got a contracting crew from Pike Electric to help us with some of the power work where the poles were broken off,” Anderson said.
As of 7 a.m. Wednesday officials with Farmer’s Rural Electric Cooperative reported approximately 200 customers who were still without power. A majority of those outages were in the Wisdom area of Metcalfe County with a few scattered outages in Barren County, said Jerry Carter, spokesman for FRECC in a press release.
Carter said crews were working diligently to restore power as soon as possible.
During the height of the storm Tuesday, East Kentucky Power, FRECC transmission supplier, experienced an outage at the Goodnight substation on U.S. 31E outside of Glasgow. Carter said the outage affected approximately 2,400 of the total 3,200 customers who where without power.
“Transmission service to the substation was restored within 25 minutes enabling power restoration to the bulk of the consumers served out of the Goodnight substation,” Carter said. “Service was restored to the 31E area just north of Glasgow by 8 p.m. The additional outages were storm related incidences primarily in Barren and Metcalfe counties, as we experienced 12 broken utility poles. The power outage affected approximately 13 percent of our 24,000 members served.”
The city of Horse Cave in Hart County also experienced power outages when a tree fell across a power line on East Main Street and knocked electricity out to the entire town, according to Ken Russell with the Horse Cave Development Corporation.
Capt. Kent Keen, public information officer for the Glasgow Police Department, provided a storm damage report Tuesday afternoon, from the 911 Dispatch Center Tuesday for streets, roads and other areas of Glasgow and Barren County. Damage had made some roads dangerous or impassable including U.S. 31E south near Lecta-Salem Road, West Washington and Jefferson streets, North Franklin and Water streets, Milton Avenue and Walnut Street, Cherry Street, Riverside Drive, Coral Hill and Franks Mill roads, Lucas Road, Cool Springs Road, Carden Road and Country Acres.

“We didn't have anyone report (a tornado) on the ground,” he said.
Gary Fancher, manager of Kentucky Division of Emergency Management for Region Four, reported numerous trees and power lines down in Allen, Hart, Metcalfe and Monroe counties.
The only funnel cloud reported locally was in the Huff community in Edmonson County, said Trooper Charles Swiney, spokesman for Kentucky State Police in Bowling Green. The funnel cloud did not appear to cause a large amount of damage in the area.
Hart County Judge-Executive Terry Martin said Munfordville managed to escape with very little damage due to the storm. Munfordville experienced some downed trees and was without power for about two to three hours.
“We didn't’ thave a whole lot of damage. It was mainly down around Horse Cave,” he said.
Outdoor warning sirens were sounded in Munfordville. Martin said county employees took shelter for about 35 to 40 minutes during the storm.

While people across the region were coping with the unseasonably hot temperatures, meteorologists at Environment Canada were keeping a close eye on a developing weather pattern. The heat and the humidity, along with that cold front, was a perfect setup for severe weather. Around 2:30 that morning, the weather agency had issued a statement calling for the possibility of severe weather.
“The pattern was recognized as a classic pattern,” Geoff Coulson, a warning preparedness meteorologist said in a recent phone conversation. “This event had the earmarks of a notable event.”
The outbreak
That heat and humidity mixed with the cold front began to trigger storms across southern Ontario. The “notable event” first took shape in Hopeness when an F2 tornado formed at 3 p.m. An hour later another tornado hit Hopeville near Orangeville. And at 4:15, a powerful F4 tornado — with a path that stretched for 115 km — formed in Grand Valley.
Several more tornadoes began to develop around the region. By 4:50 p.m., six tornadoes had formed. But the worst was yet to come.
Barrie resident Mike Montague, having just recently moved to Toronto, was heading back to Barrie on his motorcycle to pick up a few things. The 21-year-old was riding up Hwy. 400 with a friend and noticed that traffic had come to a standstill. Veering onto the shoulder, he approached the Essa Rd. exit.
It was a Friday and congestion on a highway to cottage country wasn’t unusual. But this was different.
“As we came over the crest…that’s when all the visuals started,” Montague said, recalling the day. Tractor trailers were flipped over, cars were facing every which way and horses were even running around the highway.
“I look sometimes and it’s hard to believe what happened that day,” Montague said.
“Every time you see that impending line of dark clouds coming in you stop and wonder how severe it is and what precautions you should take.”
WATCH: How does a tornado form?
Rick Monkman, retired deputy fire chief of Barrie Fire and Emergency Services recalled the day the tornado tore through the town of Barrie. He was off duty but heard the call go out to emergency services. With only two stations and 35 staff, Monkman headed out.
“When we got up here there was just mass destruction. Houses were levelled, there were still people coming out from the basements of their homes. Horrific injuries.”
The worst part is that no one saw the tornado.
“In the 30 years since, I’ve never seen any pictures of any of the tornadoes,” Coulson said.
The problem was that it was rain-wrapped, hidden in sheets of blinding rain. Many survivors recalled that they just saw a wall of darkness. And you can’t hide from what you can’t see.
Moving forward
In the end, 14 tornadoes crossed southern Ontario over six hours. At one point there were three at a time. The Barrie tornado, an F4 on the Fujita scale, lasted 15 km and was 600 metres wide. It was the most destructive that day, devastating the small Ontario city. Twelve people died, almost 300 were injured, and close to 600 homes and businesses were damaged or lost completely.
The outbreak is a reminder to Ontarians that we are in our own tornado alley. Though we aren’t prone to the more than 1,000 tornadoes our U.S. neighbours get each year, we get our fair share. Some people might be surprised that, globally, Canada comes in second in tornado frequency.
For Ontario, it’s location, location, location: with warm, moist Gulf air to the south carried up to the region and meeting the Great Lakes, the area is in a perfect area for severe weather.
When it comes to alerting the public, a lot has changed since 1985. At the time of the Barrie tornado, only severe thunderstorm warnings had been issued, disseminated on television and radio.
“There was no Internet,” said Coulson. “Now everyone is carrying with them a super-computer in relation to what was available back then.”
This means that not only can meteorologists get images in real-time across various platforms — including social media — but the public can also keep track of any risk of severe weather with news and weather apps.
And the science has come a long way since then, too. Now, Doppler radar is prevalent. Meteorologists now have a better understanding of mechanics of a tornado, the interaction of lake breezes in southern Ontario.
“It’s always in the back of our mind. We know we can get an EF4 level event in Ontario,” Coulson said. “We also know that there’s never been an EF5 event in Ontario, it’s possible as well.”
“We’re using the commemoration of what happened 30 years ago to remind a generation that’s grown up since 1985 that these storms that they think can only occur in the heart of Tornado Alley in the U.S. in Texas and Oklahoma and Kansas, well this level of event could happen here as well.”

LA LOCHE, Sask. – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the whole country grieves with La Loche and the northern Saskatchewan community must not let last week’s mass shooting change its values.
Trudeau visited the remote town one week after a shooter opened fire at a home and a school, killing four people and wounding seven. The prime minister met with the injured, with family members of the dead and with community leaders.
He also held a townhall meeting with about 700 residents.

Trudeau thanked the teachers and police officers whose brave actions “undoubtedly saved many lives.”
He said that in a time of darkness, the eye begins to see, and everyone must stand together to address deeper issues highlighted by the shooting.

“The federal government will be there not just now through the difficult time, but in the weeks, months and indeed the years to come as we look to grieve, to heal and to … thrive,” Trudeau said Friday after meeting with leaders and residents of La Loche.
He did not commit to a request from Mayor Kevin Janvier that Ottawa and the province fund infrastructure, health and education in La Loche for the next 10 years.
“I was here very much to listen today,” he said. “There is much that we heard today that we entirely agree with and we look forward to working with municipalities and … the provinces to address these urgent challenges.”
Teacher’s aide Marie Janvier, 21, died at the school and Adam Wood, a 35-year-old teacher from Ontario, died soon after in hospital. The bodies of brothers Drayden Fontaine, 13, and Dayne Fontaine, 17, were discovered in a house.

A 17-year-old boy, who can’t be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, has been charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder. Friends have said he was an outcast at home and a victim of bullying at school.

Saskatchewan Education Minister Don Morgan says the shock is still sinking in.
“You hear about these things happening in other parts of the world,” he told Global News, “but we never thought it would happen here. We planned and were ready for things, we had violent risk assessment, we had plans for lockdowns, but for it actually to happen is something that was sort of beyond our comprehension.”
Morgan added he is very thankful that first responders and the RCMP reacted as well, and as quickly as they did.
A moment of silence to remember the victims was being held Friday morning at schools across Saskatchewan.

Teachers from La Loche Community School Dene building wrote a letter to their students, saying “We’re still here.”
“The events on Friday were painful and scary and they won’t be forgotten. Some people have expressed concern that some of us have left and the fact is, we are hurt and we are healing but we are still here,” continues the letter posted on Facebook.
“We are the Dene building family. We are supporting each other so we can help support you. We will be back. We will rebuild. We will get better together.” Tweet This
Community leaders in La Loche have been speaking out about a lack of resources for young people in the wake of last week’s shooting.
Morgan says the community’s concerns have been heard.

“We want to work with them defining the path of healing, and that’s something that needs to be worked with through the town and through the school.
Classes have not resumed at the school. Morgan said people still need time to grieve and heal.

However, he added they are planning for classes to resume.
“Within the reasonably near future we’re going to want to have the kids back in school and I’m sure they want to start learning again,” he said.
“We’re starting to look at options for them to resume their education, it may or may not be in that particular structure in the short run, we’re looking at other options that are around, but it’s too early to make a long term plan,” he added.

<http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/05/18/may-19-pontian-greek-genocide-remembrance-day/> dct:description """In 1994, May 19 was selected by the Greek parliament as the day to commemorate the Pontian Greek Genocide by the Turks. The Pontic Genocide is one of the darkest moments in history not only for Greeks, but also for mankind. The Genocide vanished from its ancestral and historic homeland in Pontus a culturally vibrant and unique part of the Greek population that had been fighting for its survival for about 3,000 years.
Records show a minimum 350,000 Pontian Greeks exterminated through systematic slaughter by Turkish troops, deportations involving death marches, starvation in labor and concentration camps, rapes and individual killings. Entire villages and cities were devastated, while thousands were forced to flee to neighboring countries. The Ottoman government’s plan to annihilate the Christian populations living within Turkey, including Greeks, Syrians and Armenians, during World War I was set into force in 1914 with the decree that all Pontian men aged between 18 to 50 would have to report to the military. Those who refused to do so, were ordered to be shot immediately.
Among the causes for the Turkish campaign against the Greek population was a fear that the population would aid the Ottoman Empire’s enemies, and a belief among nationalist Turks that in order to form a modern nation state it was necessary to purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation. With the guidance of German advisers the Turkish regime created the so called amele taburu (labor battalions) were the Pontian Greeks who did not enter the Ottoman army would have to work under inhuman conditions in mines, construction works and quarries.
The Ottoman regime feared the Pontiac population not only because of their rapidly growing numbers that had reached 700,000 by the early 20th century, but also because of the cultural and economic growth of the minority. Cities like Samsous, Trapezous and Kerasous displayed a remarkable growth with dozens of schools, newspapers, theaters and other amenities. The rise of the Young Turks movement, however, would put a brutal end to the thriving Greek community of the area. While the Greek state was busy solving out the Crete problem and in no position to open new fronts with Turkey, the Pontians and many other Greeks across Asia Minor were dislocated and systematically exterminated.
The Pontians tried to fight back and resist the new politics, so they fled high to the mountains and organized themselves in small guerrilla groups. By 1921 historical records show that Pontian fighters numbered some 12,000, a force that was unwisely never deployed by the Greek army. The Greek politics of the time that failed to focus on the issue and the lost hopes of the establishment of a joint Ponto-Armenian country allowed Kemal Ataturk to proceed with the final phase of his plan.
The rise of the Bolsheviks in neighboring Russia deprived the Greek Pontians of the help they received against the Ottomans. The new Russian regime and Germany helped Turkey in all ways possible. While the Greek army was marching in the wilderness of Anatolia, Kemal kept the Greeks busy with guerrilla attacks and simultaneously carried on the massacres in Pontus. By the time of the Asia Minor catastrophe more than 300,000 Pontian Greeks had already lost their lives.
The survivors of the extended slaughters migrated to nearby Russian grounds or were included in the population exchanges that followed the end of the Greco-Turkish war (1919- 22). The Pontians that moved into Greece brought with them their surviving culture, language, customs and traditions, and enriched the social structures of the country by adding their own characteristic features.""" ;

In an announcement, issued on February 3, concerning an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling upholding Germany’s position, that it enjoys state immunity from being sued in foreign courts by victims of Nazi atrocities during World War II, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that the Greek government will study this Judgement closely, in the light of its firm and longstanding position that the matter of German compensations remains open.
The judgement affects the case of the south-central Greek village of Distomo, where Nazi troops killed 214 civilians on June 10, 1944, one of the numerous instances of WWII atrocities in occupied Greece. The court case concerned the confiscation of German property on Italian soil for reparations to be paid to victims of Distomo.
MPs Raise War Reparations Issue
Meanwhile, in Athens, 28 MPs from PASOK, New Democracy (ND), Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) as well as independent deputies tabled a motion in Parliament requesting a discussion on issues concerning the so-called German occupation loan from Greece during WWII, as well as the issue of war reparations to victims of Nazi atrocities and stolen treasures from the country.
In a letter addressed to the presidents of competent parliamentary committees, the MPs called on Parliament to adopt a clear stance on this “crucial national issue.”

Police also released a sketch of the man they believe carried out Monday's bombing and offered a 1 million baht (£18,000) reward for help leading to his arrest. But apart from the rough portrait, authorities had few solid leads.
At a news conference, the national police chief expressed uncertainty about the man's origin. Somyot Poompanmoung said the suspect "looks like a foreigner" but "might have been in a disguise and wearing a fake nose" to conceal his identity.
Two days after the attack, which authorities have called the worst in Thai history, the open-air Erawan Shrine reopened to the public.
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast that left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured at one of the capital's busiest intersections during evening rush hour.
A grainy security video shows the man, wearing a yellow T-shirt and shorts, sitting on a bench at the shrine, taking off a black backpack and leaving it behind as he stands up and then walks away. Time stamps on the video show he left the shrine 15 minutes before the explosion, which struck just before 7pm.
"If citizens or anyone can give us information or clues that lead to the arrest of this man, I have set a reward of 1 million baht," Mr Somyot said, adding that police believe the bomber worked with accomplices.
"He didn't do it alone, for sure. It's a network," Mr Somyot said. Police spokesman Lt Gen Prawut Thavornsiri said the security video appears to show two possible accomplices standing in front of the man who are also considered suspects.
Police composed the sketch based on the video and a description provided by a motorcycle taxi driver believed to have given him a ride on Monday night.
The sketch shows a young man in glasses with bushy, dark hair that is cropped at the sides. The warrant describes him as tall, with a pointed nose and thick lips. He faces six charges including conspiring to commit premeditated murder and conspiring to commit a bombing that resulted in death and severe injuries.
The attack has raised concerns about safety in a city that draws millions of tourists.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha "is worried about the security of people and tourists in Thailand," the police chief said.
Mr Prayuth has called the attack "the worst incident that has ever happened in Thailand" and vowed to track down those responsible.
The Erawan Shrine is a revered spot among Thais and tourists that transcends religion. It is dedicated to the Hindu god Brahma, but is extremely popular among Thailand's Buddhists as well as Chinese tourists.""" ;

Kodnani will serve first ten years in jail for her conviction under Indian Penal Code Section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), after which her life imprisonment under Section 302 (murder) and other sections, which is for 18 years, will begin.
While 31 convicts in the 2002 post-Godhra case have been awarded a life term, one of the absconding rioters will be sentenced on a later date.
Special Court Judge Jyotsana Yagnik had earlier convicted them on charges of conspiracy and murder in the case, even as 29 other accused were acquitted.
Kodnani, who is the first BJP leader to be convicted in a riot case, was the sitting MLA when the massacre in which 97 people were killed on February 28, 2002, took place.
Kodnani and Bajrangi have been convicted under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder).
The Naroda Patiya massacre is the largest single case of mass murder during the 2002 Gujarat riots that broke out following the Sabarmati Express train carnage near Godhra station.

In a sting operation by Tehelka in 2007, Bajrangi had boasted of how he had collected bombs and guns and mobilised a group to massacre the Muslims in the Ahmedabad locality on Feb 28, 2002. His reason: anger over the burning to death of 59 kar sewaks in the Sabarmati Express at Godhra station on Feb 27.
"I could not bear what I sawâ€¦ The next day, we gave them a fitting reply," he told a magazine.
When asked if he was present during the killings, Bajrangi said: "Yes, yes, I was with themâ€¦ So the Godhra incident happened and after what I saw, I just came back to Naroda and we took revenge."
Bajrangi reportedly took the mob through Naroda Patiya and Naroda Gaon, peopled mostly by Muslims. Most of those killed were either hacked or chased into a huge pit and set on fire.
"I came back after I killed them, called up the home minister and went to sleepâ€¦ I felt like Rana Pratap, that I had done something like Maharana Pratapâ€¦ I'd heard stories about him, but that day I myself did what he did."
Maharana Pratap was a 16th century Hindu Rajput ruler of Mewar in Rajasthan who fought against the Muslim invaders to protect his kingdom.
Bajrangi and former BJP minister Mayaben Kodnani are among the 32 people convicted in the massacre, one of the worst instances of mob killing during the 2002 riots in which 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed.

“On Sunday, at 6.30 p.m., without any bad suspicion, they returned home. Somebody knocked on the door and asked: “Are you Armenians?” My sister’s husband answered: “No, we are Azeris”, and they left. A few minutes later there was a phone call: “Kolya, are you at home?” he said “Yes”. They said: “Do not leave, in a few minutes we shall come after you”. 10-15 minutes later some 25 people stormed into their home and started to beat them up. Then they took them out into the backyard, killed the husband immediately, hit the child 5 times on the head, punched my sister severely. After the pogrom-makers left, others came and saw my sister moving. When she noticed they are approaching, she hid the kid behind her body. There was not a single untouched spot on her body; you could not recognize her face. How they killed her…

Danielyan Vitaliy, son of killed Nikolay and Seda Danielyans.
They entered the house and started to raid the flat. Then they took the parents’ passports and read a few words. One of them read out in good Russian “Danielyan”, stressing “yan”turned the page, it said “Armenian”. And he says: “Ok, this is enough”. Then they started to shout that they had come to drink blood. I was hit with a club first, and then – with an ????. Then I came to myself, tried to get my parents up, but my arm was broken, this is why I could not do it. I moved into the building entrance, started to ask the neighbors to call for an ambulance, but everybody was pushing me out and locking the doors immediately.

Assistant to the chief prosecutor of USSR N.Yemelyanov.
We certainly knew that the situation was tense there, the information was there. Then a special group was established in the Prosecution office of the USSR. And if needed we were supposed to fly there and take decisive steps to prevent disorders, and most importantly – secure quality investigation of the crimes that had been committed there. By the end of February we already were expecting that all those demonstrations and talks could shift to violence, as the situation was extremely tense. And we got to Sumgait precisely at the moment of all those disorders. That was a picture, of course… I have been into investigations for quite long, and my people are very experienced, but we were strongly depressed with all that. Everything is burning, apartments are raided, dead bodies, women are raped, and wildly raped – by 20-30 people. This bacchanalia continued for a few days. The law enforcement bodies, militia in particular, never assisted the citizens – people of Armenian nationality.
Senior detective of investigative team of the Attorney’s office of USSR V.Reva.
If the events in Sumgait were covered in time and objectively, then further they would not take such a turn. Because our people were not informed at that time what had happened there. But it was practically genocide there. When a person is being killed just for being of certain origin.

Zinaida Mudretsova, resident of Sumgait, witness.
I was talking to the father and the mother of a young woman who was killed. She was pregnant at her 6th month. Her surname was Manvelyan, name – Lola. Her mother is a teacher, father works at an institute. She was killed brutally. Her father found her in Mardakyan, dozens of kilometers from Sumgait. She had number 71 among unidentified dead bodies. Her father said that he moved around 3 morgues while he was looking for the dead body of his daughter: in Baku, Sumgait and Mardakyan.

Valerij Gasparyan, the former resident of Sumgait, a witness of the events.
The brothers were killed right in front of my eyes. This was going on during three hours – from 11 to 2 at night. All those three hours the brothers were getting beaten. Right under our balcony Valeriy was trying to escape. They got him, threw him on the ground and killed brutally – with knives and stones. I could see how he was being trampled, and then they wanted to burn him. The right side of his head was burnt. Alik was being beaten 30 meters away from his brother, and then he was killed in the same brutal way.

Rosa Danielyan, doctor, in 1988 worked at one of the hospitals in Baku.
This happened on 28 February 1988. My nurse ran up to me, she had gone out into the shop before this. She was crying and yelling. I ask her: “What happened, Laura? What is wrong with you?” We knew nothing at the moment. “Mrs. Roza, there is a truck coming full of killed men-Armenians”. She was crying and yelling. I told her: “What is this, it is not possible?!” “Yes, yes, it is true, I saw it myself, it is true!”.

It was one of the worst natural disasters in New Brunswick's history.
On the evening of October 4th, a tremendous storm tore across the Bay of Fundy. Coastal areas in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Maine suffered major damage.
The storm hit during some of the highest perigean tides, stirring up waves about two metres high. Almost every river from Pennsylvania to New Brunswick was flooded. The gale destroyed miles of the newly completed Windsor and Annapolis Railway. More than 100 people died in the Maritimes alone.
The storm hit before the normal practice of naming hurricanes, so the system officially became known as the Saxby Gale. Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby was a naval engineer who thought he knew a lot about weather. He believed that the winds and the tides were affected by the moon. Saxby had written a letter of warning in which he noted the astronomical forces predicted for October 5, 1869, would produce extremely high tides.""" ;

<http://mentalfloss.com/article/29930/40-years-ago-iran-was-hit-deadliest-blizzard-history> dct:description """Blizzard image via Shutterstock
Forty years ago this week, the deadliest blizzard on record ripped through the lower Caucasus and into Iran, where it left 4,000 people dead. The Blizzard of 1972, as this hellish storm has come to be known, wasn’t your run of the mill squall; it wiped entire villages—200 villages, to be exact—off the map.
Coming on the heels of a series of storms in late January, the blizzard of 1972 traveled through western Iran and into Azerbaijan from about February 3 to February 8, dropping up to 26 feet of snow—that’s a two and half story building worth of snowfall—and snapping telephone lines, burying commuter trains, entombing villages, and crushing cars in its wake.
At the height of this blizzard, authorities estimated that a region about the size of Wisconsin, spanning most of western Iran, was entirely buried for more than a week. Those few who survived the -13 degree Fahrenheit temperatures were without water, food, heat and medical aid for days on end at a time when—just in case these poor people didn’t have enough to deal with—a deadly flu virus was also moving through rural Iran.
On February 9, 1972, after nearly a week of constant snowfall, the blizzard broke for a brief, but merciful, 24-hour period, allowing Iranian rescue workers to be transported by helicopter out to what looked essentially like enormous snow drifts—white expanses where villages used to be.
According to Associated Press reports, some rescue workers who’d been dropped on a snow drift burying a village called Sheklab dug for two days straight, burrowing through 8 feet of snow, only to find 18 frozen bodies and no one—not one single person in a population of 100—still alive.
Another blizzard started up again on February 11, forcing rescue workers to abandon their searches. Army helicopters left two tons of bread and dates scattered over the snowdrifts, in hopes that some people could tunnel their way to the surface, but many never did.
The second deadliest blizzard on record tore through Afghanistan in 2008, bringing -30 degree temperatures and killing an estimated 926 people.""" ;

Emily Glaser, Senior Staff Writer
This article is part of a series The Miami Student is running about the University Archives. All information in the following article was obtained from the University Archives with the help of University Archivist Bob Schmidt.
With the holidays just around the corner, Oxford residents have been lucky-or unlucky, depending on whom you ask-to have avoided any snowfall and the accompanying icy conditions that make present-shopping and holiday traveling unpleasant. But if history is any indication, the worst is yet to come; the worst snowstorm on record at Miami University occurred after the holidays.
The Blizzard of 1978 blew through the Midwest Jan. 26, leaving behind a thick layer of ice underneath seven inches of snow in Oxford, and 60-70 mile per hour winds that caused a wind chill of nearly negative 40 degrees. The result: Miami students received their first day off of school in 14 years-the first since the assassination of President John. F. Kennedy.
The National Weather Service deemed the storm, which was formed by two converging low-pressure systems, a “severe blizzard.” Highways across Ohio became impassable, and cars and homes were buried under snowdrifts. More than 50 people in Ohio died as a result of the storm.
The storm was part of one of the snowiest winters on record, as the Cincinnati area reported 53 inches of snow the winter of 1977-1978. The year prior, 47 inches were recorded, as well as a record low temperature of -25 degrees with a -65 degree wind chill. The closest amount of snow recorded in recent years was 38 inches in the winter of 2009-2010.
Pranksters at Miami posted a sign outside then-Miami President Phillip Shriver’s house that read, “Welcome to Siberia,” in protest of not receiving more time off school.
The storm intensified effects of the already-in-process national coal-miners strike. Icy roads made it difficult for coal trucks to reach their destinations. James Rhodes, then the governor of Ohio, decreed that all state agencies reduce their electrical consumption by 25 percent. In addition, Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company asked its 500 largest customers, including Miami, to reduce its electricity use due to lack of coal supply.
At Miami, this meant drastic reductions in electricity. All academic buildings except Laws Hall and McGuffey Hall were to be closed from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., turning off all lights and heat during that time period. Libraries reduced their hours. Evening classes were consolidated into the buildings that would remain open. Streetlights were turned off, and the use of electric heaters, hotplates, coffeemakers, hair dryers and refrigerators was prohibited in residence halls and offices.
Despite these measures, the university remained open except for the two days following the blizzard. President Shriver said calling school off in unpleasant weather was a “new habit.” He was right, as Miami would not be called off again until Jan. 19, 1994.

According to Article 73 of the Lebanese Constitution, “One month at least or two months at most before the expiry of the term of office of the President of the Republic, Parliament shall convene upon the call of the Speaker to elect the new President of the Republic. However, should it not be convened for this purpose, Parliament shall meet automatically on the tenth day preceding the expiry of the President’s term of office.”
This Article was first amended on May 22, 1948, during the election of President Bechara El-Khoury for the second time, prescribing the holding of the election one month after the amendment of the Constitution. In 1976, it was amended anew and the new text stipulated that the presidential election should take place at least one month and at most six months prior to the expiry of the term of office of the existing President of the Republic. This has allowed for the election of President Elias Sarkis, four months before the expiry of his predecessor’s term.

1. Since the law does not impose specific terms or mechanisms for nomination, MPs did not select a presidential candidate but only enshrined what has been agreed upon outside the Parliament and voted for the candidate that seemed to attract both regional and international consensus. This is why all MPs, or the majority of them, used to attend the Parliament’s session except in two cases:
In 1970 when the failure to agree over one candidate resulted in presidential competition between Suleiman Frangieh and Elias Sarkis. Frangieh won by one vote gaining 50 votes against 49 for Sarkis.

<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-biggest-fear-romney-2020-primary-challenge-23895> dct:description """With Sen. Orrin Hatch’s announcement that he will not run again in 2018, Mitt Romney is on the verge of gaining his revenge against President Donald Trump. Until now, the Republican establishment has lacked a figurehead behind which it could mobilize against Trump. If Romney runs for Hatch’s position, he will be poised to challenge Trump in the 2020 Republican primary and to seek to rejuvenate the GOP establishment. Having failed twice, he may believe that the third time is the charm in running for the presidency.
In declining to run again, Hatch, who has served since 1977, the year Jimmy Carter became president, rebuffed Trump’s pleas to seek a fresh term. Polls indicated that 75 percent of Utahns did not want him to run again. In late December, an editorial in the Salt Lake City Tribune blasted his “utter lack of integrity” and sarcastically named him “Utahn of the Year.”
But Trump had every reason to hope that Hatch would return to the Senate. Romney, whom he humiliated in December 2016 by dangling the prospect of becoming Secretary of State, then standing by passively as Kellyanne Conway made her disdain for him palpable, is the foremost critic of Trump in the GOP and a potential vote for impeachment. Coupled with Doug Jones’ win in Alabama, the Romney candidacy is bad news for Trump.
At a minimum, a Senator Romney would offer a beleaguered Republican establishment the opportunity to regroup. Much depends on Trump’s own fortunes over the next year. In a scathing cover story in the January/February issue of the American Conservative, the historian and editor Robert W. Merry takes a pessimistic view of the Trump presidency. Merry diagnoses a “governing vacuity” at the core of his presidency. While Trump assembled a political coalition, he has been unable to create a governing one. Merry argues that figures such as Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton were capable of a sophisticated political calibration that “seems outside Trump’s capacity.”
According to Merry, “Trump seems to lack the strategic acumen and powers of concentration required to craft a coherent political strategy made up of intertwined initiatives and actions.” Instead, he appears to spend four to eight hours a day watching television in addition to golfing or tweeting ludicrous attacks on everyone from Huma Abedin to James Comey to Pakistan. In his fervor to decry his real and perceived enemies, Trump resembles a machine gun spinning around wildly that has everyone in its vicinity dodging for cover. Indeed, when it comes to Trump’s more bellicose statements, the Wall Street Journal editorial page notes today, he is “paying a considerable political price for that excess with an approval rating below 40% less than a year into his term.”
In foreign policy, Trump seems to be gyrating wildly as well. His administration, which entered office declaring that it would avoid becoming enmeshed in Middle East wars, is now taking a very hardline stance on Iran. Today, UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced, "We must not be silent. The people of #Iran are crying out for freedom. All freedom loving people must stand with their cause." The rhetoric comes straight out of the George W. Bush administration. But what will Trump do if the regime in Tehran launches a bloody crackdown? Stand by passively as did Obama in 2009 during the Green Revolution or intervene? So far, he appears to be conducting nothing more than a show biz presidency. Consistent with this ethos, Trump, in the case of North Korea, has exceeded anything that Bush declared. For good measure, he is also denouncing Pakistan as an ingrate nation and signing off on sending lethal weaponry to Ukraine.
If this keeps up, Romney, who has always been a hawk, may find that he has little to quarrel with Trump about in foreign affairs. But domestically, he will. Romney is the antithesis of Trump—a genuinely successful businessman who pioneered a version of ObamaCare in 2006 as Governor of Massachusetts. Romney and Trump have already traded brickbats in the past. Romney called Trump a “fraud” and was in turn alleged to have “choked like a dog” in his run for the presidency in 2012. As the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake points out, Romney could become a real headache for Trump: “Romney wouldn't necessarily feel the need to temper his opposition to Trump in the Senate. Utah is about equally as anti-Trump as it is pro-Romney. Trump did win the state, but that victory owed almost entirely to the state's Republican lean. Polls there showed Trump's favorable rating as low as 19 percent and his unfavorable rating as high as 71 percent, largely thanks to Mormons disliking him.”
2018 is not beginning well for Trump.

Blast in Istanbul tourist hub 1 of of An explosion of unknown origin rocked the historic centre of Istanbul on Tuesday, causing casualties, reports said.
Ten people were killed and 15 wounded in the suspected terrorist attack.
Ambulances and police were despatched to Sultanahmet, the city's main tourist hub, which is home to world-famous monuments including the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, television reports said.
The blast came after a slew of deadly attacks across Turkey in past months that has left Turkey's largest city on edge.
The force of the blast was sufficient to be heard in adjacent neighbourhoods, witnesses told AFP. TV reports said several were wounded but there was no further detail on the toll.
Turkey is on alert after 103 people were killed on October 10 when two suicide bombers attacked a crowd of peace activists in the capital Ankara, the bloodiest strike in the country's modern history.
That operation was blamed on Islamic State (IS) jihadists, as were two other bloody assaults in the country's Kurdish-dominated southeast earlier in the year.
Turkish authorities have in recent weeks detained several suspected IS members with officials saying they were planning attacks in Istanbul.
But Turkey is also waging an all-out assault on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has staged dozens of deadly attacks against members of the security forces in the southeast of the country.
"Terrorist links are suspected," a Turkish official told AFP of Tuesday's blast, asking not to be named.
Images published by Dogan showed several apparently dead bodies lying on the ground.
Media reports said the authorities were studying the possibility the blast was caused by a suicide bomber but there was no official confirmation.
The explosion was powerful enough to be heard in adjacent neighbourhoods, witnesses told AFP.
Media reports said the blast took place at 0820 GMT around the Obelisk of Theodosius, one of the city's most eye-catching monuments.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said an attack on Istanbul's tourist heart on Tuesday that killed 10 people and wounded 15 was carried out by a suicide bomber of Syrian origin.
"Unfortunately... there are fatalities, including locals and foreigners. This incident showed again we have to stand together in the face of terror," Erdogan said. Reuters, Twitter An explosion of unknown origin rocked the historic centre of Istanbul on Tuesday, causing casualties, reports said.

A group for the victims' families says it believes the grave contains more than 125 people killed by the military.
The search for mass graves follows a government-approved truth commission into atrocities committed by both the military and Shining Path rebels.
The insurgency of the Maoist guerrillas lasted two decades, ending in 2000.
The commission found that the military offered the highland town of Putis, in the southern region of Ayacucho, as a safe haven for civilians fleeing the Shining Path rebels.
It said the soldiers then tricked the villagers into digging their own graves - saying that it would be a trout pond - and then killed them on suspicion of having ties to the guerrillas.
Memorial
The BBC's Dan Collyns in Lima says relatives of the victims, who include men women and children, are now helping forensic experts to identify remains as well as giving testimony to the chief prosecutor's office.
In time, it is hoped a memorial will be built on the site.
Peru's truth commission recommended in 2003 that all suspected massacre sites be investigated, but exhumations have only recently begun.
Our correspondent says very few military officers suspected of involvement in the killings during the two decades of civil conflict have been prosecuted.
Almost 70,000 people were killed during that period. According to the commission the rebels were responsible for more than half of the killings, the military are blamed for the rest.""" ;

BBC News, Ayacucho, Peru
The grave's excavation has given relatives hope of finding loved ones Twenty-four years is a long time to hold on to the memory of a murdered loved one without knowing if you will ever find out what happened to them, or where their body is. And for most of the relatives of the victims exhumed in Peru's biggest mass grave, the possibility of finding justice for their murders would have been buried alongside them. According to the findings of Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2003, those victims - exactly 123 men, women and children - were buried in the remote hamlet of Putis. In a high mountain valley in Ayacucho, Putis is several hours' drive, along a steep dirt road with hairpin bends, from the nearest town. Nowadays, it is deserted. The Peruvian Forensic Anthropology team (EPAF) has set up camp among the derelict stone buildings, sharing the bitterly cold nights with a platoon of soldiers stationed there because the settlement lies on a route for drug-traffickers bringing cocaine from the Amazon jungle to the coast. Despite its remoteness, the testimony of relatives made the main grave easy to find. It was shallow and, on excavation, revealed a twisted mass of skulls, bones and the remains of the clothing people were wearing on the day they were killed. Embedded bullets "There are a large number of children of all ages - from very young children to nine and 10 years old," says Jose Pablo Baraybar, the EPAF director leading the exhumation. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement "We have already found evidence that people may have been shot while in the grave, we have found bullets under the bodies embedded in the dirt." The victims - all peasant farmers from the area - had been tricked by the military, who had set up a base in Putis, into digging their own grave. In 1983 the region, Huanta, was controlled by the Shining Path - a brutal Maoist guerrilla group who had declared war on the state. They had killed all the local officials and the people had fled to the mountain peaks. In November 1984, the army set up its base in Putis and invited the local population to live there under their protection. They asked them to dig a fish pond; then on 13 December they killed everyone and buried them there. After the massacre, the soldiers sold off the villagers' livestock, according the 2003 commission report. Coming home News of the exhumation has spread and Leonilda Cusiche is one of the first of a group of relatives to arrive in Putis, having trekked for hours over the mountains. Speaking Quechua, Peru's indigenous language, she explains that she is looking for her sister who, she believes, is in the grave. With a stoical expression she recounts how, aged 14, she and her family fled the Shining Path after they killed her mother, and hid in mountain caves. But the army were hunting them down too on suspicion that they were rebels. Shortly afterwards soldiers killed her father and two sisters. She managed to escape with her younger sister but they became separated and Ms Cusiche believes she died in the massacre in Putis. At the prospect of visiting the grave she begins to cry, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "Opening up the grave is like re-opening the wound," she says. Forensic biologists have pitched a tent, where they take DNA samples from the relatives to help them identify the remains in the grave. The forensic team has carefully removed remains of about 70 people so they can be individually identified. There is also evidence of about five other graves nearby; one in the old school and even one inside the walls of the stone church, which now stands roofless and covered with weeds. Aurelio Condoray (left) wants to give his dead relatives a Christian burial Aurelio Condoray says he lost about 80 members of his family in the violence of that period. He, like many, stayed away for years. He settled in the jungle, returning only to find the area abandoned. Only now, he says, his gentle eyes widening with excitement, may he return. "I want to bury my mother and brothers, to give them a Christian burial so they can finally have peace," he says. More than 20 years may have passed, but the grief is still raw. The relatives gather at the graveside and begin to weep. Some point as if they recognise a scrap of clothing amid the skeletal remains. As they sob, they mutter to themselves and their dead. Finally, heads bowed and hats off, they join in a communal prayer which lasts for several minutes. 'Just silence' Without truth, can there be reconciliation? In 2003, Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that nearly 70,000 people had been killed or had disappeared during the state's war against the Shining Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) insurgencies between 1980 and 2000. Forensic biologists are removing remains so they can be identified Few doubt that the army was ordered to kill anyone suspected of being a member of a rebel group. But it is hard to understand the logic which would lead them to kill young children, unless they wanted to eliminate witnesses. No-one has been indicted for the massacre in Putis. When the judiciary asked for information about the events or who was in command in late 1984, the response was that all documentation had been destroyed in a fire. "No-one has justified anything - what there is around this is just silence," says Mr Baraybar. "The military are not denying anything, they just refuse to give explanations - and explanations must be given." It had been hoped the largest exhumation in Peruvian history might spur efforts to investigate the fate of about 15,000 Peruvians who disappeared in the "dirty war" - only a fraction of whom have ever been accounted for. Far more disappeared in Peru than in neighbouring Chile during its military dictatorship. The difference in Peru was that many of those people were officially less than full citizens: undocumented, illiterate and indigenous. But painstakingly, Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission through the testimony of such people revealed the existence of atrocities which would otherwise have never been brought to light. The cause of the disappeared in Argentina and Chile have become examples of pursuing justice for crimes of the past long after the end of army rule. Perhaps Peru could be as enlightened as its neighbour Chile where, in 2004, the commanding general of the army assumed the responsibility of his institution for the crimes committed during the military dictatorship. No such admission has been made in Peru which, arguably, has more reason to accept responsibility as these atrocities did not occur during a military dictatorship but under democratically-elected governments.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement A winter storm is gripping the eastern US, dumping up to 16in (40cm) of snow in some areas, snarling up travel and cutting power supplies. Incidents thought to be storm-related claimed five lives and forecasters warned of 35mph (56km/h) winds in what may be the worst snowstorm in a decade. The 16in which fell at Reagan National Airport outside Washington was the most ever recorded on a single December day. The storm system is moving north toward New York and Boston. Parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts could see more than 16in by Sunday night while as many as 10in may land on New York City, forecasters said.

Reagan airport was shut down for the night, most flights from Baltimore were cancelled and there were long delays for passengers using Philadelphia and New York. Roads have been badly affected, too, with one transport official calling it a very serious storm. As Washington's Union Station filled with travellers, some of them sprawled out on the floor, the passenger train service Amtrak said delays between Washington and Boston were averaging between 30 and 60 minutes. At least two trains to Boston apparently departed more than four hours late. Traffic accidents Snow was being cleared from the M&T; Bank Stadium in Baltimore ahead of an NFL game on Sunday

Eyewitness: Eastern US snowstorm Some 500 people sought warmth and refuge in emergency shelters. Three people died in the state. One was killed when a car hit a tree, a second died of exposure and a third was also apparently killed in a road traffic accident. In Ohio, two people were killed in accidents on snow-covered roads hit by the same storm system. The US National Weather Service warned that weather conditions in the Washington area had made travel "extremely treacherous". "Do not travel," it warned drivers. "If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle." Empty malls Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty asked residents to sit out the weekend snowstorm at home where possible. US President Barack Obama, arriving back at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland from the Copenhagen climate conference, travelled into Washington by motorcade rather than helicopter because of the weather. HAVE YOUR SAY The people who were driving small cars were slipping and sliding and crashing into parked cars Steve, Arlington, Virginia Those who did venture out were treated to nearly desolate stores on what is usually one of the busiest shopping days of the year, The Associated Press reports. In snow-bound areas, there were virtually no queues to get a picture with a mall Santa on the last weekend before Christmas, it adds. "It's nice because no one's here," said shopper Nnika White, out buying a drum set for her boy of two in Richmond, Virginia. "For shopping, it's great, but the roads are very, very bad," she added. In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: "Hopefully, we'll have a little bit of a white Christmas." The storm system originated over the Gulf of Mexico, unleashing flash floods in much of the US south-east. The rain turned to snow as the storm tracked north-eastward into sub-freezing temperatures.

At least seven people were killed and more than 70 hurt when blasts tore through crowds celebrating independence day, Mexican authorities have said.
The explosions happened shortly before midnight, as people gathered in the centre of the western city of Morelia.
Local media reports suggest they may have been caused by grenades.
The city is the capital of Michoacan, a state hit by a wave of drug gang violence in recent years. It is not known who was behind Monday's blasts.
The governor of Michocoan, Leonel Godoy, said "organised crime" - a term often used by Mexican officials to denote drug cartels - was behind the latest attack.
Drug-related violence in Mexico has claimed the lives of more than 2,700 people so far this year.
"Without doubt we are faced with a terrorist attack," the governor added.
Shoot-out
The explosions went off in the main square of Morelia as the crowds celebrated the beginning of the traditional re-enactment of Mexico's cry for independence, known as El Grito, or The Shout.
"The dead and wounded... were the poorest people, who have no other form of entertainment," Reuters news agency quoted Mr Godoy as saying.
Dozens of police officers were involved in a shoot-out after chasing suspects near the scene, the local El Sol de Morelia newspaper reported.
It said soldiers were deployed to control routes in and out of the city, which lies some 250km (155 miles) west of the capital, Mexico City.
President Felipe Calderon's office said in a statement that it condemned the violence "in the strongest terms" and would redouble its efforts to support the state and its investigation.

by Marisa Helms , Minnesota Public Radio
Jeff Weise, the assailant in the Red Lake shootings, was reportedly taking Prozac, a popular antidepressant. Some research seems to indicates a link between the medication and suicide attempts and violence. (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images)
Family members of Jeff Weise say they have questions about the medication he was taking up until the day of the shootings in Red Lake. Authorities say Weise shot and killed nine people before turning the gun on himself. Weise was taking the antidepressant Prozac. The shootings are likely to renew the controversy over the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents.
St. Paul, Minn. — Jeff Weise's aunts, Shauna and Tammy Lussier, say they had no idea he would carry out the grisly shootings in Red Lake. He had been living with them for the past seven or eight years.
The two aunts spoke recently to Fred de Sam Lazaro of PBS's NewsHour with Jim Lehrer and Twin Cities Public Television.
They told him they took Jeff to get help for problems he was having with police and at school. They say his treatment included the antidepressant Prozac.
"Actually, they had just recently upped his dosage. He was taking two pills a night, they upped it to three. We think that was too much for him, too much medication for him," they said.
Prozac is the only antidepressant approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use with adolescents.
In October, the FDA ordered that all antidepressants carry prominent warnings about an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children.
In October, the FDA ordered that all antidepressants carry prominent warnings about an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children.
And now, groups oposed to the use of antidepresseants in children are calling on the FDA to investigate the possible relationship between Prozac and the Red Lake shootings.
Critic Vera Sharav is president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, a New York-based nonprofit, promoting openness and accountability in medical research. Her group has been calling attention to the potential dangers of giving children and adolescents Prozac.
Sharav points out that Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine shootings, reportedly was prescribed Prozac. Sharav says Prozac and other antidepressants in the class of drugs known as SSRIs interfere with a person's inhibitions.
"Lots of us have violent thoughts. 'I would like to take this man by the throat, he's bothering me.' But we don't do it. The drug removes that inhibition to act out and that is why you have these explosive situations," says Sharev.
"That's just not a correct scientific statement," counters John M. Plewes, medical advisor at Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac.
Though the FDA warning points out an increased risk of suicidal thinking, Plewes says that doesn't mean Prozac is at fault.
"There is no credible scientific evidence that has established a causal connection between Prozac and either violent or suicidal behavior," Plewes says. "This kind of behavior sometimes is a part of a serious, life-threatening illness -- that illness can be depression or some other illnesses -- but it's characterized by a variety of symptoms. And suicidal acts and thinking are symptoms of depression."
Despite the controversy over Prozac, an official with the American Psychiatric Association says 1.5 million kids are taking Prozac and other SSRI medications.
David Fassler is a trustee of the APA, and a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Burlington, Vermont. He says about half his adolescent patients are on SSRIs, and says they are very effective. But he says medication is best used with a comprehensive treatment plan that includes talk therapy.
Fassler says daily dosage ranges from 10 to 60 milligrams, based on body size and other factors. The severity of a child's depression is not a factor in determining dosage, he says.
Fassler says he makes sure patients and their parents understand the FDA warnings about SSRIs. He says parents need to advocate for their children to find the best treatment.
"There's no right answer for every family. They need to learn as much as they can about the risks and benefits of all treatment options, and the risk associated with not treating problems like depression," says Fassler. "Over half of the kids with depression will eventually attempt suicide. And between 2 and 5 percent will ultimately die as a result."
Whether or not Prozac played a role in the Red Lake shootings, the incident is likely to fuel still more debate over the safety of treating children and adolescents with the medication, and others like it.

Army Specialist Ivan Lopez, 34, has been identified as the gunman who killed three people and injured 16 others before killing himself yesterday at Fort Hood in Texas.

TEXANS 28-44 NEGATIVE ON BETO; SEE HIM AS PHONY, INEXPERIENCED, LEFT-WING, PRO-OPEN BORDERS
Trump, Cornyn Beat Beto by THIRTEEN in New Poll
A January survey of more than 500 Texans likely to vote in the 2020 election is bad news for defeated U.S. Senate candidate Robert “Beto” O’Rourke.
O’Rourke, who narrowly lost to Ted Cruz in the 2018 Senate contest, wouldn’t fare as well against Senator John Cornyn, who is up in 2020, according to a poll released by the pro-Trump Courageous Conservatives PAC. Cornyn leads O’Rourke 50-37 in that contest.
O’Rourke has been mentioned as a possible Trump opponent in 2020, but he’ll have to put together 270 electoral votes without those from Texas, where Trump beats him by a whopping 52-39 margin.
O’Rourke’s problems stem from his poor favorable/unfavorable numbers. Just 28 percent of Texas voters view O’Rourke favorably while 44 percent have an unfavorable view.
Among those voters favorable to O’Rourke, 27 percent said they liked his energy and personality. 19 percent liked his views, 11 percent called him honest and 11 percent said he was “for the people.” 6 percent thought he ran a good campaign. 5 percent described him as open-minded. 2 percent of voters liked the following: immigration stance, down to earth, young.
Other answers: courageous (2), stands for Texas values (2), should be president, good job in Congress, family values, uniting the country, not Ted Cruz, grassroots candidate, not a typical politician, fighter, deserves a chance, moderate stance, views on health care.
With the much larger pool of O’Rourke unfavorables, 28 percent said he was too liberal, a socialist or a communist. 11 percent said he did a bad job in office, 10 percent said he is dishonest or a liar, 8 percent says he has a bad attitude, 7 percent say he supports open borders, 5 percent dislike his views, 5 percent say he is inexperienced, 3 percent say he doesn’t stand for Texas, 2 percent say he is wishy-washy, 2 percent dislike his abortion stand. Other answers: remarks about police (3), too young (2), voting record (2), a disgrace (2), all show, anti-NRA, talks with his hands too much, big government, not believable, acts like outsider, cruel, not a good politician, not wrapped in reality, out for himself, manipulating college students, wants to legalize marijuana, negative ads on Ted Cruz, for big business, not in tune with America, wants to give away our country.
O’Rourke is 25-48 net unfavorable with men and 32-41 with women. His favorable rating does not exceed 34 percent with any age group and his unfavorables are near or above 50 percent with everyone 50 and over. He is just 33-19 with voters under 35. He is 61-8 with those who participated in the 2018 Democratic Primary. O’Rourke is 26-51 negative with those who attend religious services at least once a week, and 30-41 negative with those who never attend.
Trump beats O’Rourke 56-35 with men and 49-43 with women. He wins 60-35 with voters over 65, 56-34 with those between 50 and 64 while O’Rourke leads 49-43 with voters between 35 and 49. O’Rourke leads Trump by 51-30 among those under 35.
“Along with Colin Allred in District 32, Robert “Beto” O’Rourke is one of the two most extreme leftists that North & South Texas have produced in a century,” according to Christopher Ekstrom, chairman of the Courageous Conservatives PAC. “Socialism is back in Texas, and a reckoning is required to vanquish it again.”
Atlantic Media & Research of Nags Head, North Carolina surveyed 504 registered voters with live operators for Courageous Conservatives PAC. Respondents either voted in the 2016 general election or registered since that time and said their chances of voting in the 2020 presidential election were “definite” or “very likely.” 49 percent of respondents were reached on cellphones and 7 percent of surveys were completed in Spanish. The theoretical margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent in 95 percent of cases. Calls were completed between January 5-11, 2019.""" ;

Continuing with the jabs, deadmau5 made fun of his own success by stating that he would play his own hit, 'Ghosts N Stuff,' in a "derp" tone:
So what did deadmau5 end up really doing? He found an online mashup of Martin Garrix's 'Animals' that is remixed with the kids' song 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm' as the beat drop, and played that mashup to the thousands of concert attendees listening to his set. You can hear the reworked version of 'Animals' below. (If you're not familiar with the original version of 'Animals,' we've posted the official music video below the sound clip.)
Listen to Martin Garrix's 'Animals' Remixed with 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm'
Listen to the official version of Martin Garrix's 'Animals'
Afterwards, deadmau5 gave himself a pat on the back for his stunt.
Deadmau5 is no stranger to controversy: He has infamously criticized DJs who he feels simply hit the "play" button on their laptops, and even once wrote a blog post proclaiming that he does it, too. He has also publicly feuded with rapper Flo Rida as well as Avicii , another DJ who has become famous in the pop world. Deadmau5 was replacing Avicii at last night's Ultra Music Festival concert as the headlining artist due to Avicii's health scare earlier this week.""" ;

(GK: Garrison Keillor, SS: Sue Scott, TK: Tom Keith, TR: Tim Russell, LP: Lynn Peterson) GK & LP:
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why Babe
It don't matter anyhow.
Winter is coming by and by, Babe
It's on its way right now.
I wish there were something I could do or say
I wish we had the money to just fly away
But we're broke and married so we've got to stay
Don't think twice it's all right. GK: Winter's arrived in Minnesota. We postponed it as long as possible. End of October. It's time. Nine years ago the famous Halloween Blizzard struck Minnesota ---- 28 inches of snow fell in the Twin Cities, 37 inches in Duluth ----- and trick-or-treaters had to struggle through deep drifts ------ (BLIZZARD) SS: You tie this rope to your ankle and Daddy and I will hold onto the other end. TR (CHILD): Do I have to go? SS: There's three hundred feet of rope, that should get you as far as the Carlsons. TR (CHILD): Maybe I should wait for it to stop. SS: If you need to cut the rope because you find yourself being dragged along behind a car or something, here's a razor blade ---- I'll stick it here inside this apple. Okay? TR (CHILD): Maybe I could go tomorrow. SS: Other kids are going and you can too. You're a Minnesotan, son. Minnesotans don't stay home just on account of a little snow. (BLIZZARD, WOLVES) GK: The blizzard of January, 1975: remember that one? Roads were closed for about 11 days. (TIRES SPINNING IN SNOW) Twenty foot drifts. The train got stuck at Willmar. Eighty mph winds, 35 Minnesotans died from freezing and exposure and you know something, most of them were glad to go---- TR (GEEZER): I feel warm, my whole body feels warm. I hear music, people are smiling at me. My wife's not here. GK: There were temperature drops of 75 degrees when that storm came through, from 40 to 35 below. Eighty below windchill. (CAR STARTING ATTEMPT) GK: There were two more blizzards that winter, in March. Twenty foot waves on Lake Superior. Zero visibility. (FOOTSTEPS IN SNOW) SS: Where are we? TR: Got no idea. SS: You don't think we're near home? TR: What home? SS: Do I know you? TR: I don't think so. SS: I thought you were Bob. TR: Howard. SS: Where'd you come from? TR: Saw you reach out your hand so I took it. SS: Wonder what happened to Bob? TR: No idea. SS: Want to come in the house and get warm? TR: Sure. Why not? GK: The next fall, November 10th, 1975, that was the winter storm that the Edmund Fitzgerald went down in. And then of course there was the November 11th, 1940, blizzard, the great Armistice Day Blizzard. Weather was balmy that morning and duck hunters were out and then it started raining and the rain turned to snow, and 27 inches fell. TR (GEEZER): Yeah, I remember that one. Armistice Day it was. 1941, I believe. GK: 1940. TR (GEEZER): Back there. Forty or forty-one. Right in there. GK: 1940. TR (GEEZER): I remember it, it was in the early forties. Big blizzard. Friend of mine went duck hunting and never came back. GK: Who? TR (GEEZER): I forget his name. But he died in that blizzard. Blizzard of 41. GK: 1940. TR (GEEZER): Your mother and I were trapped in the house for a week. And nine months later, you was born. GK: The blizzard of 1960, that must've been. TR (GEEZER): 1940. I remember it now. (BRIDGE) GK: Winter can come on suddenly. One January day, the temperature dropped 40 degrees in one minute in some places, as a blizzard came in. There have been times when the temperature never got above zero for 19 days straight. At Tower, in 1991, it got down to 60 degrees below zero. At 60 below zero, your spit freezes before it hits the ground.----- (HAWK, SPIT, DING OF ICE HITTING GROUND). In the winter of 1982 we had 38 inches of snow on the ground right here in St. Paul, all at the same time. In the winter of '96, 153 inches of snow fell at Lutsen: that's 12-feet-9 inches. SS: I moved the living room upstairs. Too dark down here. GK: We can go three, four, five weeks in a row without seeing the sun come out, the sky grey, it feels like you're on an entirely different planet, one of the gassy ones, like Saturn. That's the planet of winter. And it's here, folks. October is no indicator of what's ahead. We're stepping off into a new season, the one that can last six months, and that's why, as a public service, we bring you this message from the Minnesota National Guard. (KLAXON WARNINGS) TK (BULLHORN): NON-RESIDENTS, LEAVE THE AREA. (KLAXON) TR (GENERAL): This is General Frank Mills of the Minnesota National Guard. Instructing all visitors to leave the area immediately. (TK BULLHORN: Leave the area.) Go to the airport. This is the last warning you'll get. Winter is a killer. It can come in and grab your leg like you were a pocket gopher and chew you right up. Winter doesn't fool around. This is not a movie. Repeat. This is not a movie. I walk around St. Paul on a winter afternoon, I see the frozen bodies ---- people wearing summer clothes, their bodies stiff, frozen as they tried to unlock their car. They wandered out ---- they thought, Oh the restaurant's only a few blocks ---- a minute later they were stiff as a bridge abutment. People, winter isn't kidding. We native Minnesotans, we can handle it. We can deal with it because we grew up here and we don't know any better, but the rest of you ---- for your own safety, I am ordering all citizens who have resided in Minnesota less than half their lives to report to the airport for evacuation. SS: My husband's a native but I'm from New Orleans. I love the summers here. And fall was so lovely. I liked to sit out on my veranda and sip a cool drink and fan myself. TR (GENERAL): The van is right outside, ma'am. We'll send for you in April. SS: I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. TR (GENERAL): That's exactly why we're doing this, ma'am. GK & LP:
It ain't no use in turning up the heat, Babe
To drive away the cold
And it ain't no use in turning up the heat, Babe
Just try to stay on the road.
Winter is hard and it wants your soul
It makes you feel 86 years old
But it could be worse, so I've been told
Don't think twice, it's all right. (c) 2000 by Garrison Keillor""" ;

Hits: 13397
Lawrence citizens have always emphatically insisted that the only victims during the Lawrence raid were "peaceable, unarmed citizens."
History proves them wrong.
Lawrence citizen Richard Cordley wrote, “It was not the shooting of a few obnoxious persons. The killing was indiscriminate and mostly in cold blood, the victims being quiet, peaceable citizens. None of them, as far as I know, had taken any part in the early disturbances, and none of them were connected with the border troubles during the war. I do not now recall a single military man among the killed….The guerrillas shot the men they found, without knowing who they were or caring what they were.”
The actual truth about the raid can be found in reviewing the historical record. After he gathered his men for the Lawrence raid Quantrill supplied his men with maps with each targeted house marked for destruction and “Death Lists” of individuals to be killed. The names and places shown came as no surprise. In its entirety it showed the enormity of the opposition and the level of the Kansan’s participation in waging war against her neighboring state. The foremost movers against the institutions in Missouri were those from the east that had come to Kansas in military styled companies associated with the New England Emigrant Aid Society. The remainder of the names were radical abolitionists, operators on the Underground Railroad, who had enticed or stolen slaves from Missouri, newspapermen who were guilty of fomenting unrest and calling for invasion and plunder in Missouri and assassination of Missouri slave owners, and naturally any military men either in the Federal army or Kansas militia.
Robert S. Stevens who took an unofficial accounting of the dead and wounded after the raid recorded 133 names of those killed in Lawrence also listing wounded including both white and Negro casualties. General Thomas Ewing’s Official Report on the sack of Lawrence recorded almost the exact number of casualties listing 140 dead, including 14 from the 14th Kansas Cavalry and 20 from the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment with 24 wounded. Captain Henry E. Palmer stated 145 lives lost in his account of “The Lawrence Raid, Running Fight with the Guerrillas,”Lawrence citizen Richard Cordley listed in his account “Pioneer Days in Kansas” 150 dead and 30 wounded. Cordley recounted that “one hundred and twenty-two were deposited in the cemetery, and many others in their own yards.”
Below you will find the names of the victims of the Lawrence raid compiled from several sources and thus there is a larger number listed than from each individual account. A large majority are in the military. Since the Kansas provost-marshal's files were destroyed in the fire that engulfed the building that held its records we can naturally assume from the accounts emulating from Lawrence that the remainder of the names were in the town's militia organization.

CONAKRY, September 24, 2014 (AFP) - Police in Guinea have arrested 27 suspects over the murders of an eight-member Ebola education team attacked by angry locals in an area at the epicentre of the outbreak, the government said on Wednesday.
The victims, said to include local health officials and journalists, went missing after their delegation came under attack during an outreach visit to the southern town of Womey on Tuesday last week.
Eight bodies were recovered from the septic tank of a nearby primary school two days later.
"Most of the main perpetrators of these crimes have been placed under arrest -- a total of 27 people," Justice Minister Cheick Sacko told a news conference in the capital Conakry.
He said the suspects were being questioned in the southern city of N'Zerekore by the public prosecutor.
"The government will see this to the end. I promise to see that justice is done and to make the guilty pay the price for this inhuman tragedy," he added.
The deadliest Ebola epidemic on record has killed nearly 3,000 people in west Africa and infected twice that number, according to the World Health Organization.
The virus emerged in Guinea at the start of the year and has infected 1,008 Guineans, killing 632 of them.
The spread in Guinea has been accompanied by fear and paranoia by villagers who feel the government and the international community cannot be trusted.
Many Guineans believe local and foreign healthcare workers are part of a conspiracy to either deliberately introduce the outbreak, or invented it as a means of luring Africans to clinics to harvest their blood and organs.
Police lieutenant Richard Haba told AFP last week the outreach team was attacked by protesters who had come "to kill them because they think Ebola is nothing more than an invention of white people to kill black people".
At least 21 people were wounded during violent scenes in which the team was pelted with stones, according to local police.
There was further violence on Tuesday in the southwestern town of Forecariah between security forces and locals angry at the burial by Red Cross workers of an elderly woman thought to have contracted Ebola.
Witnesses told AFP on Wednesday protesters threw stones at the burial team, forcing them to flee as traffic came to a standstill and shops and offices were closed.
A local government official said the family had been wrongly informed that the Red Cross were going to cut up the body.
There was no immediate information on the size of the crowd and whether there had been any casualties.

<http://ryanhanrahan.com/tag/great-appalachian-storm/> dct:description """Connecticut meteorologists love talking about nor’easters but do you know about the state’s biggest southeaster? The “Great Appalachian Storm” of November 25, 1950 was one of Connecticut’s most violent wind storms on record. In some towns the wind speeds in 1950 were only exceeded by the great hurricane of 1938!
The storm was only of modest strength in terms of central pressure – 980ish mb. But what made the winds vicious was the 1050ish mb high near Maine. The freakishly strong pressure gradient produced violent southeasterly and easterly winds across New England. Here are some of the wind gusts recorded in Connecticut on November 25, 1950.
Bridgeport – 88 m.p.h.
New Haven – 77 m.p.h.
Hartford – 100 m.p.h.
The 70 m.p.h. 1-minute sustained wind in Hartford remains the strongest wind recorded for the official Hartford records since observations began in 1904. The second highest value is 64 m.p.h. recorded during the October 3, 1979 tornado. In Bridgeport the sustained wind of 62 m.p.h. is one of the highest on record (since 1948) with the highest occurring during Gloria in 1985 at 74 m.p.h. sustained and two other higher wind speeds during the winters of 1964 and 1969. Note on record: 2-minute sustained winds replaced 1-minute sustained winds in 1995.
For a non-tropical storm there’s no question in my mind that the 1950 southeaster was the most violent windstorm we’ve seen. The standardized anomalies from Richard Grumm at the NWS in State College shows a wide area of +4 standard deviation 850mb winds. That’s quite a low level jet! The winds reached 160 m.p.h. on Mount Washington in the core of that LLJ.
Looking at the reports from that day here in Connecticut temperatures in the warm sector came close to 60º with highs in the upper 50s in Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven. The unseasonably warm weather, when coupled with a a ripping low level jet, lead to enough turbulent mixing to mix down destructive winds – in some cases to 100 m.p.h.!
Here are some of the comments from the official weather bureau reports.
Hartford – “Of paramount interest in this month’s weather is the occurrence of “The Great Wind Storm of November 25, 1950″. Considering its great extent, extreme weather of various types, and its unusual meteorological character, this storm will be long remembered. At Hartford, E’ly winds averaged the amazing speed of 38 m.p.h. for the entire day of the 25th, and attained gust speeds of at least 100 m.p.h. on at least 3 occasions between 4:30 and 7:30 p.m..”
Bridgeport -” Storm of Nov. 25th worst since 1938. Station inundated with 4 to 5 feet of water.”
New Haven – “Severe southeast storm on 25th. Extensive wind and water damage to shore fronts. Many trees, wires, antennae down, roofs damaged. Max for 5 minutes: 50 SE at 1:55 PM (17 Hrs.), probably exceeded 8:00-9:00 PM. Fastest single mile: 57 SE at 1:56 PM (17 Hrs.), possible exceeded 8:00-9:00 PM. Gusts: 55 MPH at 1:35 PM; 66 MPH at 4:20 PM; 66 MPH at 7:40 PM; 77 MPH 5 second gust at 4:45 PM… 5 min. max record; fastest mile exceded in Sept. 1903.”
The strong winds produced widespread tree and power line damage across the state. The winds tore a roof off a dormitory at UConn and ripped shingles off roofs across the state. Several shoreline homes lost their roofs according to a Hartford Courant article from shortly after the storm.
The storm surge flooding was extensive on the coast. In New London the tide reached an impressive 7.58ft MLLW. The only storms higher in the last 100 years are the 1938 hurricane, hurricane Carol, and hurricane Sandy. In Stamford at the Hurricane Barrier the tide reached 9.5ft NGVD which was similar to Irene’s tide level.
Much like Sandy, the storm surge flooded large portions of New York City including the lower east side and Laguardia Airport. Sandy’s surge, however, was much more powerful in the parts of the City, like Staten Island and the Rockaways, with Atlantic exposure.
On the Connecticut shoreline houses, cottages, railroad tracks, and beaches were swept away. Newspaper accounts indicate that the sand was several feet deep on coastal roads and was removed by snow plows. Many people had to be rescued from their homes after refusing to heed evacuation orders.
The storm resulted from an exceptionally deep dip in the jet stream and monstrous closed low that formed over the Appalachians in a trough the went negatively tilted. The easiest way to visualize this is to look at the 500mb height anomalies associated with the low. Much like Sandy, there was a large “block” downstream. In the 11/25/1950 case there was a 350+ meter positive height anomaly over eastern Quebec. The upper level low itself over the central Appalachians was an exceptionally impressive 450+ meter negative height anomaly.
This type of unusually deep system lead to unusually cold weather and extreme snowfall in the Appalachians and the Ohio River valley. The storm is one of the worst blizzards in parts of the country. Steubenville, Ohio recorded 44 inches of snow while the synoptic desert of Pittsburgh dug out from 30.5 inches of snow!
In the southeast U.S. the backside of the storm delivered a bitterly cold air mass. The mercury dropped to -3º in Atlanta, GA. Many observing sites saw their coldest November temperatures on record. 850mb temperatures reached an INCREDIBLE -20ºC over northern Georgia at 12z 11/25/1950.
Not very often do you see a -6 sigma 850mb temperature! The exceptional baroclinicity and phasing resulted in what amounted to one of the most impressive east coast storms of the 20th century.
While we frequently refer to the March 1993 storm as the “storm of the century” the November 1950 storm gives ’93 a run for its money. For east coast storms we really had 2 storms of the 20th century.""" ;

Premier Brad Wall is suggesting that it's not likely a northern Saskatchewan high school where two people were shot to death will be torn down.
Wall says there are no immediate plans to demolish the school in La Loche and it will be utilized.
Although, the premier adds it will be a school division decision.
The Northern Lights School Division has said Feb. 22 is the earliest the La Loche high school could reopen.
A teacher and an aide were killed and seven others hurt in a shooting at the school last month and two brothers were also killed at a nearby home.
La Loche interim mayor Kevin Janvier and others have suggested that it needs to be torn down and rebuilt before the community can move forward.
The premier also says he updated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday on issues in La Loche, such as school safety and counselling, the possibility of teaching trades and community development.""" ;

The Eyemouth Disaster of 1881
The worst Scottish fishing disaster ever recorded was the Great Storm of October 1881. In Eyemouth it is known as 'Black Friday.' After weeks of bad weather the local fleet were becoming impatient to go to sea. On Friday 14th October 1881, they awoke to a calm morning. Ignoring the low reading on their barometer, they put to sea. By midday they had just begun their line fishing when the whole country was hit by a violent storm. The boats rushed home but many failed to make it safely into the harbour. They either capsized or smashed on the Hurkar Rocks at the harbour entrance. Their families on the pier looked on helplessly.
A total of 189 men lost their lives that day. They left 93 widows and 267 children. The Berwickshire Coast was worst hit. Eyemouth alone lost 129 men, and one third of its fleet. Others were from the nearby villages of Burnmouth (24), Coldingham Shore (3) and Cove (11). Seven men were also lost from Musselburgh's Fisherrow and 15 from Newhaven. Two days after the disaster, one of the Eyemouth boats, the 'Ariel Gazelle' limped into the harbour. Her crew were all safe. Instead of trying to make for the shore, they had struck out to sea and rode the storm.
A Disaster Fund was set up for the relief of the families of those lost at sea. Money poured in from all over the country. Over £50 000 was collected. Widows received 5/- a week with 2/6d for each child who was attending school regularly. There were also unborn children to consider.
A few years later, work began on Eyemouth Harbour. Some felt that the loss would not have been so great if the improvements had not been delayed. For this, they blamed the 'tithes' disputes, which took place in Eyemouth in the mid 19th century. Bitter arguments took place between the local fishermen and the church, and Willie Spears, known as 'Kingfisher', led the fishermen. It is said that on the morning of the Disaster, he was apprehensive and said there was going to be an earthquake.
The people of Eyemouth will never forget 'Black Friday'. Many in the town are descendants of those who were lost that day. A Memorial stands at the sea front and in 1981, a commemoration service was held to mark the centenary. A special tapestry hangs in the Memorial Room in Eyemouth Museum. It records the names of all the boats and crew who drowned. Beginning with the storm, it ends on a note of hope, with images of new technology and a sunrise signifying a new day. Today the town is the largest fishing port on the South East Coast of Scotland.

The unspoken implication is that the Russians found the corpses of the Tibetan-Agharti adepts who were assisting the Nazi cause and that, like Haushofer, they committed ritual suicide.
Firstly, hara-kiri was a Japanese samurai custom, which many Japanese soldiers in the Second World War enacted to avoid capture. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism, however, consider suicide an extremely negative act with dire consequences in future lives. It is never justifiable. The report inappropriately attributes Japanese customs to Tibetans. Secondly, any soldiers of Himalayan origin found in Nazi uniform would most likely have been Kalmyk Mongols, not Tibetans. Further, the Kalmyks’ fighting in the German army does not prove their support of Nazi ideology or the support of it by their Tibetan Buddhist beliefs. Let us examine the historical facts, supplementing them with information gained from interviews with Kalmyks living in Munich Germany who had participated in many of the events described below.
The Kalmyk Mongols are practitioners of the Tibetan form of Buddhism and have a long history of association with Germans. A large group of them migrated west from the Dzungaria region of East Turkistan between 1609 and 1632. They settled in Russia along the lower Volga, where it empties into the Caspian Sea. There, they continued their nomadic herder way of life.
In 1763, Czarina Catherine II the Great invited almost thirty thousand Germans to settle in the Volga region to the north of the Kalmyks. She wanted them to farm the fertile land and secure it against the “Tartars.” She tried to force Christianity and agriculture on the Kalmyks, causing many to flee back to Dzungaria in 1771. Eventually, however, those who remained in Russia were accepted, especially since they were excellent soldiers. During the Napoleanic Wars (1812–1815), for example, the Russian Army had a Kalmyk regiment. Over the next century, Kalmyk soldiers were prominent in divisions throughout the Czarist Army.
Although the life styles and customs of the agrarian Volga Germans and nomadic Kalmyk herdsmen differed greatly, the neighbors gradually came to respect each other. The Germans, in fact, took interest in the Kalmyks. As early as 1804, Benjamin Bergmann published a four volume work on their language and religion, entitled Nomadische Streifereien unter der Kalmüken in den Jahren 1802 und 1804 (Nomadic Migrations among the Kalmyks in the Year 1802 and 1804). Sven Hedin passed through Kalmykia on one of his early expeditions to Dzungaria and expressed great admiration for its people.
After the Communist Revolution in 1917, many Kalmyks remained loyal to the Czarist forces and continued to fight on the White Russian side, especially under Generals Vrangel and Deniken. Before the Red Army broke through to the Crimean Peninsula at the end of 1920, about twenty Kalmyk families fled across the Black Sea with Vrangel and relocated in Warsaw Poland and Prague Czechoslovakia. A much larger number left with Deniken, with the majority settling in Belgrade Serbia and smaller numbers in Sofia Bulgaria and in Paris and Lyon France. The Kalmyk refugees in Belgrade built a Buddhist temple there in 1929. The Communists severely punished the Kalmyks who remained behind, beheading ten thousand.
In 1931, Stalin collectivized the Kalmyks, closed the Buddhist monasteries, and burned the religious texts. He deported to Siberia all herdsmen owning more than five hundred sheep and all monks. Partially due to Stalin’s collectivization policies, a great famine struck from 1932 to 1933. Approximately sixty thousand Kalmyks died.
After Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in September 1941, Goebbels invited to Berlin several prominent Kalmyks from Belgrade, Paris, and Prague to help with a propaganda campaign. The Nazis wished to win the Kalmyks to the German side against the Russians and never sent any of those under their rule to concentration camps. Thus, Goebbels organized this nucleus into a committee to free the Kalmyks from the Communist regime. In this connection, he helped them print a Kalmyk language newspaper and used them to broadcast radio news in Kalmyk directed toward Kalmykia.
When the Nazi Sixteenth Panzer Division under Field Marshal Mannstein took Kalmykia early in 1942, three members of this committee accompanied them. A number of Belgrade Kalmyks also participated in the invasion, having joined the German army after the Nazi occupation of Serbia in April 1941. The people of Kalmykia greeted the German army with butter and milk, the traditional offering to welcome guests, as liberators from Stalin’s oppressive rule. The Germans said they would dismantle the collectives and would divide and privatize the land. They allowed the Kalmyks to practice Buddhism once more. In response, the Kalmyks exhumed the religious texts they had buried for safekeeping and built a makeshift temporary temple. In November and December 1942, however, the Red Army retook Kalmykia and destroyed everything the people had rebuilt.
The German troops invited the Kalmyks to retreat and continue the fight with them. About five thousand joined the Nazi military, forming the Kalmykian Voluntary Cavalry Corps. Only a few woman and children accompanied them. The Kalmyk troops fought with the Nazi army behind the lines, especially around the Azov Sea. The majority of the Kalmyk population, however, remained in Kalmykia. In December 1943, Stalin declared them all German collaborators and deported the lot to Siberia. They returned only during the Khruschev era, between 1957 and 1960.
In the early autumn of 1944, in the face of the imminent Russian invasion of Serbia, many Belgrade Kalmyks fled to Munich Germany to avoid Communist persecution. A learned Buddhist teacher and several monks accompanied them. At the end of 1944, the Kalmyk cavalry troops that survived in Russia, together with their families, retreated with the German army. About two thousand went to Selesia Poland and fifteen hundred to Zagreb Croatia, where they were reorganized to fight against the partisans.
Thus, although a number of Kalmyks were in Germany and Nazi-held territory in the final months of the war, only a few were in the Berlin area, still engaged in propaganda work. The Kalmyk soldiers in Nazi uniform were in Poland and Croatia, not in Germany. Although several Kalmyk monks performed Tibetan Buddhist rituals in the Kalmyk barracks and homes in Nazi-held territory, they prayed for peace and the welfare of all beings. No Tibetans were among them and they did not conduct “occult” ceremonies for a Nazi victory, as some postwar occult accounts report.
After the war, the Kalmyks left in Western European countries were intered in displaced persons camps in Austria and Germany, especially in the Munich area. Released in 1951, they settled first in Munich. Later that year, the Anna Tolstoy Foundation resettled the majority of them in New Jersey, USA. Tito handed those left in Serbia over to the Soviets, who promptly deported them to Siberia.""" ;

<http://theadvocate.com/news/13048930-123/surveillance-video-released-thursday-shows> dct:description """Recordings of 911 emergency calls and police-radio traffic released Thursday depict the fear and adrenaline among moviegoers and officers after a gunman opened fire 20 minutes into a screening of the film “Trainwreck” at a Lafayette theater.
In response to a number of records requests from media outlets, Joy Rabalais — a Lafayette attorney representing city-parish government — released the audio, a responding officer’s dash-cam footage and The Grand 16 Theatre’s surveillance video showing the shooter’s entrance into the cineplex on July 23.
Mobile/table users: Click here to hear audio of 911 calls.
“He shot right at people,” the first caller told a 911 dispatcher, also reporting through labored breathing that the “older guy” in a white shirt fired “six or seven” shots.
Five calls later, another woman, through tears and panicked breaths, gave a similar description of the shooter. The next caller reported the shooting as he ran through the parking lot toward Johnston Street. Both said they were inside the theater when the shooting began.
Another woman calls next, and in a calm demeanor reported a woman who had been shot had walked out of the theater as she walked inside. Two calls later, a man calmly told the dispatcher, “we need more ambulances.”
A more chaotic scene is heard when a theater employee who worked in the box office reported to a dispatcher that a second person had been wounded.
“There’s two people shot, two people shot,” she said while running toward the victims.
“The ambulance is on the way,” she told someone on scene as people in the background are heard crying.
Mobile/tablet users: Click here to see police dashcam video.
As one officer arrived at the theater, his dash-cam footage shows a crowd of moviegoers congregated on the opposite side of the theater from where the shooting happened.
“He had a handgun!” one woman yelled.
Authorities released only six 911 calls of at least more than two dozen, citing exemptions protecting the victims’ information and extent of injuries along with witness accounts said to be useful to the police department’s open criminal investigation into the shooting, Rabalais said.
Another 500 direct calls made to the Lafayette Police Department about the shooting have not yet been reviewed by the city’s legal representatives.
But another collection of recordings distributed Thursday offer a window into what officers learned as they spoke over police radios that night, gradually realizing the magnitude of what happened in the theater.
“Can you give me any information on a suspect or anything? I don’t want to walk into a guy with a gun,” an officer said.
A dispatcher responded with information about two reported victims, telling the officer “the white male was last seen behind the theater.”
As the officer tells the dispatcher he’s headed toward the back of the theater, another intervened with new information.
“They said he is inside. He is in number 14 — that he is reloading,” an officer said. “He has a weapon. We have an active shooter here.”
“Headquarters, get as many units as you can. Call the S-O and state if we have to,” another officer said to dispatchers, referring to the Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office and Louisiana State Police.
“10-4, 10-4,” a dispatcher replied.
“I need units, and I need units with rifles in here,” an officer said.
“All right headquarters, listen. We need everybody over here. Send anybody you got.”
“10-4,” a dispatcher replied. “We are sending everybody. S-O is also in route.”
“Take it easy,” an officer said. “Everybody’s en route. We’re coming.”
Seconds later, the recording captures the radio calls of out-of-breath and anxious officers entering the theater.
“OK. We’re just advised the suspect shot himself,” a dispatcher told one of the officers.
“What number? What number theater? We are in the theater,” an officer replied.
“Fourteen. Number 14,” the dispatcher said.
“We got one subject down,” an officer said as he enters the crime scene.
“All right, we got several more victims inside!” another officer shouted, his voice quavering with adrenaline. “Suspect is down! Suspect is down! We have several more victims inside with gunshot wounds!”
“We got an additional four or five victims in number 14,” an officer said.
“Actually, six victims. Number 14.
“Headquarters, we got one subject down. With a black handgun.”
“We have the suspect. He is down. We need more units inside to start helping triage. Also, bring first-aid kits. Immediately.”
Authorities also released surveillance video showing the gunman as he purchases a ticket, enters the lobby and walks about 10 minutes late into Screen 14, where he would soon kill two people and injure nine others before turning his .40-caliber, semi-automatic handgun on himself.
The timestamp on the footage is 18 minutes and 25 seconds faster than the real time that night, Rabalais, the city-parish attorney, said.
John “Rusty” Houser, 59, is seen in the video at about 7:20 p.m. purchasing a ticket to the 7:10 p.m. showing of the film. He walked through the lobby, entered a hallway and trailed a man and woman holding hands as they moseyed toward their screen destination.
Houser, of Phenix City, Alabama, began to follow the couple into another auditorium before he turned around and enters Screen 14.
Initial police reports indicate he opened fire inside the auditorium at 7:28 p.m.
The two women who died in the shooting, 21-year-old Mayci Breaux, of Franklin, and 33-year-old Jillian Johnson, of Lafayette, were buried Monday. Of nine who were injured, one person remained in a Lafayette hospital on Thursday.

After Ithaca’s mayor declares a snow emergency, the college closes for the first time in 13 years
Online Sports Editor |
For the first time since March 1994, Ithaca College closed its campus and canceled all classes yesterday because of weather.
The decision to close the campus was made because the forecast called for the heaviest snowfall during the day yesterday, said Dave Maley, associate director of media relations.
Rather than having students and employees commute from off-campus locations and risk dangerous travels, the college closed early in the morning, he said.
“The decision was made to close and not open at all today so we didn’t get into a situation where we had people come in and then close anyway,” Maley said.
Ithaca Mayor Carolyn Peterson declared a snow emergency at 5 p.m. Tuesday, which was still in effect last night. Travel advisories were also issued for the city of Ithaca, warning against nonessential travel.
According to the National Weather Service, upward of 20 inches of snow were
expected between Tuesday night and early this morning. A heavy snow warning was in effect for Tompkins, Yates, Seneca, Southern Cayuga, Steuben, Schuyler and Chemung counties through 10 p.m. yesterday.
Winds between 10 and 20 mph and gusts of up to 30 mph were expected to drop temperatures to as low as 15 degrees below zero.
While the heavy snowfall was expected to end late last night, scattered snow showers will continue into this morning, according to the National Weather Service.
Cornell University closed its campus at 12:30 p.m. yesterday as a result of increasingly heavy snowfall. TCAT buses maintained their normal routes and schedules through early last night.
According to Maley, closing the college yesterday will not affect the academic calendar for the spring semester. He also said as of last night, he was unsure of whether the college would resume its normal schedule today.
“[Yesterday] morning I began relaying the information to the media about our closing at just before 5:30 [a.m.],” Maley said. “We’ll [announce a closing] as early as possible, but not prematurely.”
The last time the college closed its campus was more than 10 years ago, according to Maley. Unlike yesterday, the county shut down all its roads, forcing the college to close its campus, as well. As of yesterday afternoon, the county had not shut down any roads.
While students had the day off from classes, essential employees, including staff members of all dining halls, the Health Center, the Physical Plant and Residential Life, had to brave near-blizzard conditions in order to get to the campus. Mary Kranz, the supervisor of nurses at the Hammond Health Center, said it was important for the college to maintain a residential atmosphere in the midst of the storm.
“Ithaca College prides itself on being a residential college,” Kranz said. “If they’re going to have kids living here on campus and encouraging that, then we need to provide the services so that they have them when they’re here.”
Investigator Tom Dunn began his shift at 3 p.m. yesterday. He said the inordinate amount of snow led to a slight increase in calls.
“It was busier than your average day,” Dunn said. “We had some slips and falls, some accidents with people and their snowboards, another person was injured playing football — just a number of outdoor activity injuries.”
Kranz said the winter weather usually leads to more student injuries and illnesses.
“When it starts to get snowy out there’s a lot of snowboarding and sledding and kids jumping around,” she said. “But there’s been a lot of flu on campus, so we’ve seen flu-like symptoms and colds.”
According to Kranz, the Health Center staff met Tuesday to devise a plan that accounted for traveling in the heavy snow. The workers in closest proximity to the college were selected to work if the college closed.
With most students enjoying the day by staying warm indoors, a number of students could be seen enjoying the snow. A group of four students created a makeshift snowboarding hill out of a 15-foot high snow bank outside the Campus Center, extending down to the handicapped railing by the Center for Natural
Sciences, and grinded by the more skilled snowboarders. Random groups of students could be seen playing football on the quads or outside the Fitness Center.
Whether or not the college is closed today, Kranz won’t have to worry about commuting.
“I’m going to stay here overnight,” Kranz said. “The great thing about the Health Center is that we have beds.”""" ;

<http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/hundreds-of-thousands-still-without-power/> dct:description """Hundreds of thousands of people in six states across the Northeast remained without power on Monday, as utility crews, expecting some help from warmer temperatures, worked to repair the damage wrought by a severe storm that struck on Friday.
The system was one of the worst ice storms to strike New England in years, initially cutting off power to more than a million people, dumping a foot of snow and ice on some areas, and forcing thousands to flee their homes for shelters. As temperatures rebounded and soared past 40 degrees on Monday — reaching as high as 60 degrees in some isolated areas — the ice melted and allowed utility crews to more quickly accomplish the task of restoring downed power lines. But emergency officials said they continued to worry that a widespread thaw might cause bent trees to whip back up and obliterate more power lines.
Many public schools in the six affected states — New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and upstate New York — announced closings on Monday, and public officials said emergency declarations would remain in effect. In Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick encouraged many non-emergency state employees to stay home from work if conditions in their areas remained dangerous.
As of early Monday morning, more than 300,000 homes, offices and businesses remained without power throughout the region. Many of those outages were concentrated in New Hampshire, one of the hardest-hit areas. Officials with the Public Service Company of New Hampshire said on Monday they were still trying to restore power to 138,000 customers, about a third of the 322,000 who were affected in the state at the height of the outages on Friday.
To speed the recovery effort, hundreds of National Guard soldiers were dispatched to the state on Monday to help clear trees from roads and remove other debris.“They are working on getting the power back but it is labor-intensive work,” Jim Van Dongen, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Bureau of Emergency Management, told Reuters.
In Massachusetts, meanwhile, officials said that slightly more than 100,000 customers were still without power, down from over 300,000 at the height of the ice storm on Friday. President Bush declared nine of the state’s 14 counties in states of emergency over the weekend.""" ;

SHARMINI PERIES, EXEC. PRODUCER, TRNN: Welcome to The Real News Network. I'm Sharmini Peries, coming to you from Baltimore. According to the CIA and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, it is estimated that at least 3,000 young men from Tunisia, mostly under the age of 30, has visited Syria to be trained by the Islamic State. This is critical information relevant to unpacking who is responsible for the attacks that took place in the Tunisian capital, Tunis. The two gunmen in military gear rushed the Bardo National Museum in Tunis on Wednesday. They killed 19 tourists, and two dozen more were injured before security forces raided the building to end the siege, killing the two assailants. Joining us now from New Orleans, Louisiana, is Mohamed-Salah Omri. Mohamed is an associate professor of modern Arabic language and literature at the Oriental Institute at the University of Oxford. Thank you so much for joining us, Mohamed. MOHAMED-SALAH OMRI, ASSOC. PROF., ORIENTAL STUDIES, UNIV. OF OXFORD: Thank you. Glad to be here. PERIES: So, Mohamed, what do you know so far about the incident that took place? And who's responsible? OMRI: Well, first of all, my heart and condolences go to the victims and parents and friends and through the Tunisians who I think are in shock at this moment. What actually seemed to have happened is that two people, possibly more, disguised in military gear, entered the Bardo Museum, which is a national institution and a world-renowned museum, which is adjacent to the parliament, and went on a shooting rampage. And the disastrous outcome is what you outlined in the news a minute ago. PERIES: So the attack came days after the death of Ahmed Al-Rouissi, a Tunisian who's also known as Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi, who led the contingent of Islamic State fighters in Libya. He was killed in clashes with the Libyan troops, I understand, in Sirte, which is a stronghold of the former president Gaddafi. Now, what do we know about this kind of influence that's going on in Libya and its relationship to what's happening in Tunisia today? OMRI: Well, the borders with Libya have been a source of concern ever since the revolution in Libya started, actually. But while the flow of people at the beginning was mostly refugees, and a lot of them still living in Tunisia, that particular border, as Libya's situation went downhill and very violent, became porous for smuggled goods, but also for the movement of people across from Tunisia to Libya, and then on to other parts, like Syria, but also of Libyan, mostly, weapons coming in back from Tunisia, to Tunisia, or Tunisians go and train or run away. For example, answer Ansar al-Sharia, who were accused and their leader accused of the killing of the left-wing leader, Chokri Belaid, ran, basically, and took refuge in Libya, and Ahmed al-Rouissi, one of the key suspects in that killing, seemed to be part of that contingent. So as long as--you know, basically, what happened to Libya has a direct effect on what happens in Tunisia. PERIES: And so begin explaining to us what is happening in Tunisia that is causing such a exodus of young people to go to a place like Syria and to get trained by the IS. OMRI: At certain level, the number is shocking, because really you don't associate Tunisia--there were always [incompr.] with that high number of militants intent on taking part in this sort of quote-unquote holy war executed from Syria and Iraq. But the numbers are very high. And unemployment itself doesn't explain it. There has always been a high level of unemployment. Social conditions do not explain it. There was a lot of recruitment efforts, I think, made by radical elements, Salafists and others, at the beginning of the first few years of the revolution. There was a climate of freedom and movement for everybody. And I think a lot of people, including preachers who came from the Gulf region and other places--and a lot of money reportedly moved, in order to facilitate recruitment. So a lot of mosques in Tunisia turned into places where you'd actually recruit and indoctrinate young men, mainly (but also some women) and then send them off. And I think that can be explained by a lack of, if you like, political will and opening up of the security situation in a chaotic post-revolution situation, in addition to very hard organized work by the recruiters and their allies and a lot of money. That led, I think, to these numbers. PERIES: Now, Tunisia is being held in high regard as a success story of Arab Spring having brought about democracy and having done it peacefully after the revolt and rebellion. Now, what are the conditions on the ground now? And is that a true story? Or is that a myth I just described? OMRI: At the political level, I think, still believe that the process in Tunisia is very, very good and on track. Tunisia had witnessed a number of very successful and free and fair elections since 2011, unlike almost any other country in situations similar to that in that part of the world. There was several transitions between--and government, peacefully. The economy did not stop altogether. The social life continued, and a lot of opening up of the society. The economy was shaken, and continues to be shaken, I think. So at the political level, I think the writing of the Constitution and a whole arsenal of laws have been enacted, and there is currently a permanent parliament that was [incompr.] elected and an executive branch also elected. And the other bodies that are emerging from the new constitution are underway. So I think in that sense the process has been successful. Has Tunisia been able to contain the festering terrorism that started first in the fringes and directed itself at the military and the security services and then seem to have moved on now to the tourists for very specific reasons that we can come back to? I don't think it has. But so that's, I think, a picture as I describe. PERIES: Elaborate on that point. Why the targeting of tourists? OMRI: Well, I think that's the lifeblood, more or less, of Tunisia, and its soft spot as well. Tunisia before 2010, I think it received about 7 million tourists. And there was a lull in tourist activity, but that--then that picked up. So tourism is a main source of foreign currency for the country. The openness of the country continued, and the image of marketing, if you like, Tunisia as a place where you can come have fun has a cultural riches as well, succeeded, didn't--there was no major setbacks. So what it was--in a sense, this was an expected target, because, remember, if people are intent, if people are intent on breaking an economy like Tunisia, what you do is you simply hit the tourism sector. We remember, there was a case like this one in Egypt, called Luxor, an attack on tourists, and that led to a hiatus, if not a almost complete shutdown of tourism, for about two years in Egypt. PERIES: Right. And this is very clever in that sense, as the European and the rest of the Western world cannot just dismiss it as something that happened in Northern Africa. This really hits home. So in terms of targeted strategy of the IS, it's a very clever one. And finally, Mohamed, my last question to you before you go--I know you're very busy today and probably has a number of other interviews to do--what do you think will be the response of the state to this incident now? OMRI: Well, the response of the state at the public statements are strong and united. And there was, I think, even a public response in terms of demonstrations and so on. But my feeling and hope, actually, is that the government takes the question of terrorism more seriously than it has thus far. We know, for example, that the enactment of a legislation against terrorism has been slackened in the previous parliament and in this one. That's for three years. But the action against terrorism has been there, but it has not been through a strategy. And I think that all led to a sense of confidence among the terrorists. So I hope that this will spell the end of that lax response and lack of strategy on the part of the government. PERIES: Mohamed, thank you so much for joining us today. OMRI: Thank you.

<http://todayshistorylesson.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/the-midwests-weather-playground-turns-violent/> dct:description """Samuel Glenn was a Sergeant in the Signal Corps. His job was to, three times a day, take weather measurements and then send them up the chain to the weather guys. The weather guys would then plot those readings on maps, which would give them a picture of what the weather was doing.
These days, computers and sophisticated electronic sensors handle most of these measurements (and many more besides) almost instantaneously, but in the 1880’s, that was how it was done…and Glenn was dedicated to his task.
At 11:42am on January 12, 1888, Glenn had slowly (he was fighting a stomach illness) made his way to the roof of the station in Huron, South Dakota. His readings earlier in the morning showed temperatures that were more than 20 degrees warmer than the previous day. The reason? That surge of warm, moist air that we talked about the day before yesterday.
All throughout the Midwest, it was one of those “throw-open-the-doors-and-raise-the-windows” kind of days. Temperatures that had been well below zero for some time were now, in places, 30 above zero…it was like spring. Hundreds of children, kept home because of the cold, not only went to school, but did so without their heavy coats…some without coats at all.
Glenn’s position on the roof gave him a perfect view of what happened in that minute between 11:42 and 11:43, and it’s recounted in David Laskin’s brilliant book The Children’s Blizzard. “‘The air, for about one (1) minute, was perfectly calm, and voices and noises on the street below appeared as though emanating from great depths. A peculiar ‘hush’ prevailed over everything. In the next minute the sky was completely overcast by a heavy black cloud, which had in a few minutes previously hung suspended along the western and northwestern horizon, and the wind veered to the west (by the southwest quadrant) with such violence as to render the observer’s position very unsafe. The air was immediately filled with snow as fine as sifted flour. The wind veered to the northeast, then back to the northwest, in a gale which in three minutes attained a velocity of forty (40) miles per hour. In five minutes after the wind changed the outlines of objects fifteen (15) feet away were not discernable.'”
Within two hours, Glenn would be experiencing wind gusts of nearly 80 miles per hour. That massive storm that two colossal fronts had created was now smashing into the Midwest with the coverage of a hurricane and the power of a tornado (many witnesses reported the tornado-esque sound of a freight train). Along with the gale force winds came snow, some comprised of water droplets blasted by the wind into needles that made it impossible to see, others crushed to a dust-like consistency that made it nearly impossible to breathe.
As the massive blizzard blasted through each succeeding town, it largely caught everyone by complete surprise. The weather changed in the matter of a minute or two. Today, we have computerized weather models that allow forecasters to make at least general predictions far in advance. What’s more, we actually have a communication system in place that doesn’t require oats to run or fingers to tap. But in 1888, those systems didn’t exist. Even if storm warnings were given promptly, their transmission was still largely by word-of-mouth or a paper pinned up at the post office.
Some school teachers immediately released their students to race home, but it was already too late. Others kept them in the school houses to ride out the storm, but the blizzard was so violent that the buildings couldn’t keep out the cold and the wind.
Many that tried to make it home either became lost in the almost complete blindness, or succumbed to the brutal windchills. The temperatures?…some stations reported drops of 18 degrees in just three minutes.
It was a story that was played out over and over as the storm blew east and south. In its wake it left the real killer…brutal, brutal cold. Behind the storm came high pressure and Arctic air. In many midwestern locations (including the Iowa town in which I live), the historical record lows for January 12th, 13th, and 14th are still dated 1888. And the frigid blast continued south, dropping temps in Dallas into the 20’s and to near freezing as far south as Mexico.
Hundreds of children and not a few adults, disoriented by the blinding snow and exhausted by efforts to reach safety, now faced temperatures of -40°F. They simply couldn’t do it, and so they died…by the hundreds. Sadly, some of these may have been saved by 20th-century medical practices, but they, like the weather and communications systems, didn’t exist in the 19th century.
The Children’s Blizzard (so named due to the number of children lost) claimed as many as 500 lives. One historian would write, “A scene became quite familiar in many localities, the arrival of a party in quest of a doctor and bearing either on their arms or in some sort of conveyance, the half frozen body of a neighbor or two who have been exposed to the storm…”.
In the 1880’s, the Midwest was still pretty much the “wild west”, and people choosing to settle there – many amid promises of land and a bright future – quickly discovered a very harsh and unforgiving region. But nothing could really prepare these men and women for the brutality of the Children’s Blizzard.
Back east, people in the relative safety and warmth of their cities took comfort in (and sometimes boasted of) their “advanced” protection. But 1888 was just beginning, winter wasn’t nearly over, and the east would soon feel it’s wrath as well.

The city of Vaughan got a small dose of good news in the wake of Thursday's devastating tornado -- only 44 homes have been deemed unsafe and an unsalvageable, down from an initial estimate of 200.
One school has also been deemed unsafe. Orders have been issued to restrict access to those structures.
"We're asking residents to out and secure their homes as soon as possible," Vaughan's Mayor Linda Jackson told a late Friday afternoon news conference, adding the state of emergency will continue until at least Saturday.
However, she also believes the estimate that 600 homes suffered damage to still be accurate.
Environment Canada said Friday it believes the damage comes from an F2 tornado.
"We've seen one car that was flipped end over end from a stationary position," Arnold Ashton said Friday. "That's not easy to do."
Homes had their entire roofs lifted off. The roofs in the affected area are of a sturdy design, "so it takes a lot of strength in the wind to take them off," he said.
An F2 tornado -- the Fujita scale goes from zero to five, the most powerful -- would generate winds of 180 to 240 kilometres per hour, Ashton said.
"I've lived in Vaughan for 40 years myself and I've never seen any devastation like this," Jackson said. "It's very overwhelming in the fact that there was not one casualty, and not one serious injury."
Jackson also thanked surrounding municipalities for offering to help in the recovery effort. Both Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Toronto Mayor David Miller offered their assistance Friday morning.
"I have spoken to Mayor Jackson and have offered Toronto's assistance to Vaughan should it be required," Miller said in a statement.
McGuinty said Emergency Management Ontario would be assisting in the clean up of damaged neighbourhoods on Friday.
There are four "critical areas" in the City of Vaughan, with police, fire and rescue personnel on site, Jackson said.
Andrew Park and Martin Grove Road
Moonstone Place and Houston Drive
Gamble Street and Islington Avenue
Melville Avenue and Haymer Drive
Jackson said building inspectors will be out on Saturday in those hard-hit areas to assist homeowners.
The city of Vaughan declared a state of emergency Thursday at around 7 p.m. after the storm tore through the area, leaving more than 7,000 homes and businesses without power.
Two centres were established:
Evacuation cente at Father Fulfon Community Centre, 8141 Martin Grove Rd., Woodbridge
Emergency shelter, Maple Community Centre, 10190 Keele St., Maple
The city encouraged people to register at one of those centres. The Insurance Bureau of Canada (416-362-9528, ext. 4700) has representatives there.
Those with hydro issues are aslled to call Powerstream at 1-877-777-3810.
People can call Access Vaughan at 905-832-2281. The line will be staffed between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Tornadoes were also reported in Newmarket, Milton and Durham. Environment Canada is still investigating other possible tornado sites.
Death in Durham
Elsewhere, police in Ontario's West Grey municipality confirmed Friday that an 11-year-old boy died when the storm struck Durham, Ont., south of Owen Sound.
He was attending a day camp when the storm hit a conservation area. West Grey Police Chief Rene Berger said emergency crews performed CPR on the boy just before 4 p.m. Thursday, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. His name was not released, at the request of his family.
Six other people suffered minor injuries.
Environment Canada also believes the Durham tornado to be an F2.
The storm system moved west to east across southern Ontario on Thursday, with tornado warnings starting in the late afternoon and continuing on well into the evening.
It also passed over Toronto, where a funnel cloud was reportedly seen near the central intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets.
Miller said Toronto handled hundreds of calls for problems such as fallen trees or disrupted hydro, but it was spared the level of destruction that was visited upon Vaughan.

<http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/mobile/the-sky-was-green-barrie-looks-back-on-fatal-tornado-30-years-later-1.2387150> dct:description """It's been nearly 30 years since a powerful tornado ripped through the Barrie, Ont., area, killing 11 people and leaving a wide path of destruction, but the memories of the natural disaster are still fresh in the minds of many residents.
Carol MacMillan was mowing her lawn on May 31, 1985 when she noticed a sudden change in the air, alerting her to the fast-approaching twister.
"The sky was green," MacMillan recalled. "You could feel it was almost an electrical static in the air."
The north-east travelling tornado ended up missing MacMillan's home and instead moved down into a valley, obliterating other buildings in its path, including Natalie and Verne Ferrier's house. The pair was standing in their garage with two friends when the tornado struck.
"We didn't see it coming because it was behind us," Natalie Ferrier told CTV Toronto on Friday.
The tornado blew away the garage and uprooted trees that could be seen flying over top of them. A number of branches landed on Ferrier, and her husband was struck by a piece of farming equipment.
"I was laying under a bunch of trees so they had to lift them off and (my husband) got hit by a plow," Ferrier said.
The tornado then travelled east over Highway 400, carving out a path of destruction approximately 600 metres wide. A home where a 12-year-old girl and her grandmother were staying at the time was on that path. The girl helped saved her grandmother by leading them to a basement storm cellar.
"She took them into these doors and this is where they stayed," said Linda Marek, who now lives in the home. "When they opened the doors, they could see the sky."
In total, 13 tornadoes touched down in Ontario that day, killing 11 people -- eight in Barrie and three in the nearby community of Grand Valley. Across North America, dozens of twisters also struck Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, making the disaster one of the most intense tornado outbreaks to hit the region in history.
The fatal Barrie twister was rated an F4 on the tornado scale, as violent winds on that day topped more than 330 kilometres an hour.
Technology in those days meant that residents only had minutes to run to safety, but today, that warning time has increased to 15 minutes and experts predict that will likely increase in the future.
"Are we eventually going to see 15 to 30 minutes, 30 to 40 minutes? I think it's going to happen but it's difficult to say what that timeline is going to be," Environment Canada meteorologist Geoff Coulson said.
Records show the 1985 Barrie tornado is still considered the strongest one to ever touch down in Ontario. Experts say storms of that magnitude typically come around every 15 years.

Updated
An Australian man, who was among 23 people killed when gunmen stormed a famed museum in Tunisia's capital, has been identified as Javier Camelo.
The dual Australian-Colombian national and his mother were among at least 20 tourists killed at the Bardo National Museum near the Tunisian parliament.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop released a statement on Thursday, saying consular officials confirmed a dual Australian-Colombian citizen, who was a resident of New South Wales, was among the deceased.
Later, in Question Time, Mr Abbott said the Government's "deepest sympathies and condolences go to his family and friends".
"His family are being rendered every possible consular assistance," Mr Abbott told Parliament.
"Plainly, it is an attack by Islamist extremists on a fledgling democracy, a democracy which had thus far proven quite effective in resisting the kind of extremism characterised by Al Qaeda and its variants and the ISIL or death cult in the Middle East."
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten described the attack as an act of murder.
Speaker Bronwyn Bishop visited the museum where the attack took place as a guest of the Tunisian Government last year.
"I was in that museum. I met with many of the new people forming that new democracy, the new constitution," she said.
"The efforts and hopes and aspirations they have for all their people, men and women alike, and I just feel that the strength we can convey to them to say that we feel with them that they will persist in their ideals and will not be dissuaded by terrorism is something we all feel."
Twenty foreign tourists were killed in the attack, Tunisia's health minister said in a new toll.
"Thirteen people (killed) have been identified and seven are being identified," Said Aidi said.
He said the dead included three Japanese nationals, two Spaniards, a Colombian, a British woman, a Belgian woman, two French citizens, a Pole and an Italian.
Mr Aidi said a policeman was also killed but he did not mention a second Tunisian victim initially reported by the authorities after the attack.
The Colombian foreign ministry confirmed two nationals killed in the attack were a mother and her child who were enjoying a family holiday.
The ministry confirmed the father of the family survived.
Mr Essid said Kalashnikov-wielding gunmen, dressed in military uniforms, opened fire on the tourists as they were disembarking from a bus and chased them inside the museum.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Tunisia — the birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement — has struggled to tackle a rise in attacks from Islamist extremists.
In a televised national address, Mr Essid declared: "All Tunisians should be united after this attack which was aimed at destroying the Tunisian economy".
Analysis: correspondent Matt Brown The first Tunisians heard about the shooting was a live cross from a reporter in the parliament, which is just next door.
They said they were being surrounded by security personnel — they and the parliamentarians — and that two men with Kalashnikov assault rifles had attacked the tourists.
The gunmen were apparently killing at random and it was not until the security forces moved, in obviously a reasonably sensitive area, that the two attackers were killed.
A security guard was possibly also killed by the security forces when they moved.
The majority of the death toll are foreign tourists. So it is obvious that if that is what the attackers wanted to do, that is a good place to go.
The prime minister of Tunisia said in a national address that this attack was an attack on the economy which was obviously a reference to the fact that tourism is one of the pillars of Tunisia's economy and this really could make a serious dent in that trade because these victims were largely from Europe.
Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi also addressed the nation, promising a merciless "war against terrorism" in the wake of the attack.
"I want the Tunisian people to understand that we are in a war against terrorism and that these savage minorities do not frighten us," he said in brief remarks on television.
"We will fight them without mercy to our last breath."
Television footage showed dozens of people, including elderly foreigners and one man carrying a child, running for shelter in the compound, surrounded by security forces aiming rifles into the air.
Health minister Said Aidi told reporters that 38 others had been wounded in the attack, including citizens of France, South Africa, Poland, Italy and Japan.
The attack appeared to be the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al Qaeda suicide bombing on a synagogue killed 14 Germans, two French and five Tunisians on the island of Djerba in 2002.
Some officials, including French prime minister Manuel Valls, said hostages were taken at the museum but this was not confirmed by Tunisian authorities.
Interior ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told reporters that "two or more terrorists armed with Kalashnikovs" had targeted the museum next to the Tunisian parliament.
Mr Aroui said about 100 tourists had been inside the museum at the time of the attack.
He said "anti-terrorist units" had entered the museum but refused to confirm reports of a hostage taking.
Politician Monia Brahim said the gunfire prompted parliamentary committees to suspend their meetings as politicians were ordered to assemble in the main chamber.
"There was enormous panic," another politician, Sayida Ounissi, wrote on Twitter, saying the attack took place during hearings on Tunisia's anti-terrorism law.
Tunisia has seen an upsurge in Islamist extremism since the 2011 revolution that ousted longtime strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Dozens of police and military personnel have been killed or wounded in attacks blamed on Islamist militants.
An army offensive against the jihadists, who are linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, has been underway since 2012 but the ground and air campaign has failed to eliminate them.
The country is also fighting against the radicalisation of Muslim youth, with authorities saying as many as 3,000 Tunisians have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight in jihadist ranks, including the Islamic State group.

Updated
Australia's ambassador to Turkey says he saw flames shooting up and engulfing vehicles when a car bomb exploded at a busy transport hub in Ankara, killing 37 people.
Key points: Blast in Kizilay Square kills 37 people, injures scores more
Australian ambassador James Larsen was just metres from the explosion
He has described a chaotic scene
No Australians killed or injured in the blast
The explosion in Kizilay Square in the capital Ankara, a key commercial and transport hub close to the city's embassy area, left more than 100 people injured and reduced several vehicles including a bus to burnt-out wrecks.
Security officials have said there is evidence one of the two suspected bombers was a woman who joined militant group the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK, three years ago.
Ambassador James Larsen in his car with his 12 year old daughter when the bomb went off on the other side of the traffic lights they were sitting at, about 20 metres away.
"As is always the case with these instances, you hear a pop, and then of course, we saw flames shooting up and a bus and car catching alight and flames spreading out," he told 7.30.
"It was very distressing. There was a great deal of movement amongst the people around; it was a very, very crowded area.
"I said to my daughter 'make sure you put your head down low in the car on the floor' so she was away from any glass.
"I moved the car to the side of the roadway and called the office to make sure that we initiated our crisis procedures."
Mr Larsen said emergency services were very quick to respond.
"It's a well-policed and well-serviced area, so you had police and emergency services people moving in very, very quickly and dealing with crowds and looking very carefully at the site of the blast," he said.
No Australians killed in blast
Mr Larsen said the Turkish Government told him no Australians or other foreigners were killed or injured.
The ambassador said Australians looking to travel to Turkey should consider the advice on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Smart Traveller website.
"We have been advising for some time of the risk of terrorist incidents. They could occur anywhere in Turkey," he said.
"Our mainstream Turkish travel advice is exercise a high degree of caution but as you get down to the south-east, we say reconsider your need to travel.
"Within a 10 kilometre boundary of the Syrian border... we say do not travel."
Violence has spiralled in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish south-east since a two-and-a-half year ceasefire with the PKK collapsed in July.
But the militants, who say they are fighting for Kurdish autonomy, have largely focused attacks on the security forces in south-eastern towns, many of which have been under curfew.
Police have detained four people in connection to the bombing, the second such strike at the administrative heart of Ankara in under a month.
In response to the attack, Turkish planes carried out strikes on Kurdish separatist positions in northern Iraq.
A police source said hours after the explosion that there appeared to have been two attackers, a man and a woman, whose severed hand was found 300 metres from the blast site.
The explosives were the same kind as those used in a February 17 attack that killed 29 people, mostly soldiers, and the bomb had been packed with pellets and nails to cause maximum injury and damage, the source told Reuters.
Turkish authorities have imposed a news blackout and barred local media from showing images of the dead or revealing further details of the investigation.
Local hospitals are posting the names of the dead, and relatives have held funerals for at least 17 of those killed.

<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-16/robert-xie-trial-blood-stains-helped-convict-murderer/8184856> dct:description """Blood stains, shoeprints and a slip of the tongue were among the key pieces of evidence used by investigators to prove Robert Xie was guilty of Sydney's shocking Lin family murders.
A tiny stain discovered on the floor of his North Epping garage, almost a year after five members of the Lin family were murdered a short distance away in July 2009, could have been the difference between Xie being convicted and walking free.
Loading...
It was among a series of exhibits tendered during Xie's six-month trial that have now been released by the NSW Supreme Court.
The evidence also includes video footage of police interviews, in which Xie denies knowing anything about the killing, and audio of hysterical triple-0 calls made by Xie's wife Kathy Lin after she found some of the victims' bodies.
"I'm not sure but maybe somebody killed, killed my brother's family," she told a triple-0 operator after she went to the home of her brother, Epping newsagent Min Lin, who had failed to show up for work.
Photographs taken during a police search of Xie's garage almost a year later show a ramshackle of old furniture, some pieces stacked on top of others.
DNA tests found blood from four of Robert Xie's victims in a stain on his garage floor. ( Supplied: Supreme Court of NSW )
They also show a blood stain on the garage floor, which came to be referred to as "stain 91" during Xie's murder trial.
It was subjected to DNA analysis and prosecutors said it contained a mixture of at least four of the victims' blood.
It is believed Xie returned to the garage after the murders and failed to notice the stain.
Xie was arrested and charged in May 2011.
By a majority of 11 to one, a jury last week found Xie guilty of murdering Mr Lin, his wife Lily, sister-in-law Irene and two young sons Henry and Terry.
All were beaten with what police suspect was a hammer and most also suffered neck compression injuries and asphyxia.
Shoeprints reveal Xie acted alone
Bloodied shoe prints matched a type of shoe worn by Robert Xie. ( Supplied: Supreme Court of NSW )
The evidence released by the court also includes photographs of bloodied shoeprints found on the carpet of the Lin family home.
Those impressions were matched to a particular model of shoe known to have been worn by Xie.
Xie's legal team claimed the shoe prints could have been created by more than one type of shoe. ( Supplied: Supreme Court of NSW )
The absence of any other relevant shoeprints meant police could confidently say there was only one killer involved in the crime.
During the trial, Xie's lawyers claimed the shoe impressions could have been left by a number of different brands.
They also refused to accept that stain 91 was actually blood, and said the DNA could have been transferred to the garage floor in a number of different ways, unrelated to the murders.
Xie participated in a number of police interviews and his wife was also questioned extensively by investigators.
In one police interview, Xie told officers he had seen Mr Lin on a bed after his wife discovered the bodies.
But Mr Lin's body was actually only discovered by police hours later, because it was concealed by a doona.
Xie called the officer-in-charge the next day, fearing he had incriminated himself.
Police photographed Robert Xie's garage during a search in May 2010. ( Supplied: Supreme Court of NSW )
In her triple-0 call, Mrs Lin can be heard speaking in Cantonese, begging her husband to stay with her at the crime scene until police arrive.
But Xie insisted on leaving the murder scene so he could pick up his parents-in-law from their home in Sydney's west.
Police believe Xie used this time to dispose of the murder weapon.
Mrs Lin has told the ABC it has been a traumatic few days for her and her husband, and they need time to talk to his lawyers about their next steps.
She repeated Xie's courtroom declaration that he did not kill her brother's family.""" ;

As police continued to piece together what drove Mr Miles to shoot dead his wife Cynda, daughter Katrina and children Taye, 13, Rylan, 12, Ayre, 10, and 8-year-old Kayden on their Osmington Road property near the West Australian holiday town of Margaret River, Mr Cockman staged an impromptu press conference, baring his soul to the media just 48 hours after his world was torn apart.
Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 57 seconds 57 s Grieving father speaks about deaths of four children
The grieving father was certain the 61-year-old murdered his family before taking his own life, and believed it was his own heartbreak over the plight of two of his children that culminated in the explosive act of violence.
The pain of two sons struck down
Mr Cockman said Mr Miles had struggled for years to recover from the shock after one of his sons took his own life.
He said when he recently learnt another of his sons was seriously ill with kidney problems, it tipped him over the edge.
"Peter has been just trying to hold it together for a long time," Mr Cockman said.
"I thought, 'There's no way possible he could lose another son, he'll kill himself'.
"But I thought, 'No he won't do that either because he's so close to my kids that he would not leave the kids upset for the rest of their lives about it'."
Mr Cockman said that through Mr Miles's emotional turmoil, the slaying of his family may have emerged in his mind as a way to "fix" his pain.
"He's thought this through, he's not snapped," he said.
"He's just gone, 'Right, I can't kill myself, I can't live any more, so this is it for me, but I need to take out everyone with me because that will fix the whole problem'."

A methodical crime
In a candid address that came as a shock to police, Mr Cockman described in detail what he had been told by the investigating officers about how the mass shooting unfolded.
He said he had been told Mr Miles first shot his daughter and four grandchildren while they slept in their beds, in a shed that had been converted to a second house on the property.
He then turned the gun on his wife in the living room of their house, before placing a triple-0 call to police alerting them to his crimes.
When they arrived, Mr Miles was also found dead from a gunshot wound.

Mr Cockman said he no longer felt angry, just incredibly sad for his four young children who would no longer have a chance to live out the hopes and dreams he held for them.
The struggle to return to normality
The last of the children's bodies have now been removed from the crime scene and funeral plans are underway as the children of Margaret River return to school today.

Education Department Southwest Region director Neil Milligan said the coming weeks would be challenging for many local students.
"On Friday the Department of Education immediately provided specialist services to support students and staff at schools in Margaret River. This support will be in place again today and maintained for as long as required," he said.
"Staff from the Department, including lead school psychologists, will be available to support parents and others in the community as they respond to this extremely challenging situation."
WA Education Department School Psychology Service manager Chris Gostelow said teachers should reassure students they were safe and that mass shooting events were not common occurrences.
"I think we need to reassure kids that this is an extremely rare event, it's not the sort of event that happens all the time thankfully and that they are safe. They're safe at school and they're safe at home," he said.
Mr Gostelow said trauma could make communities draw closer together.
"Communities will often see these horrible situations as situations where they can actually come together and renew their connections and even grow in certain ways," he said.
As a team of specialist investigators in blue forensic suits continue their work on the Osmington Road property, the regular rhythm of rural life slowly, painfully begins to return.
"It is tragic but life has to go on," neighbour Richard Dossor said.

"I finished my day yesterday mowing grass and chopping firewood and this morning we were tagging lambs."
Police Commissioner Chris Dawson revealed yesterday the local officers who first responded to the horrific crime scene on Friday morning were also back at work.
"The officer in charge and the other officer attending are on duty today," he said.

"We will provide them with support, but they're both going as well as can be expected and I've got full confidence in them.
"Communities such as Margaret River have seen trauma before and they will recover, but this will take some time."
Those traumas include a 1996 rockfall on a beach at nearby Gracetown, which killed four children and five adults, raging bush fires, and several shark attacks in the region, the latest just last month.
Australian Medical Association president and West Australian local Michael Gannon said the trauma of this incident would no doubt be visited on every person in the town.
"Small rural communities are very tight-knit, this will have mental health consequences and I would encourage anyone who feels they need help to seek it from their GP," Dr Gannon said.
"It's a fabulous part of the state that most of us know reasonably well. They will bounce back, it's a strong community, but at times like this it's important it comes together, and it's not a sign of weakness if you're suffering mental health problems to seek help.
"Margaret River is one of the more famous parts of Western Australia, and it's sad now outside our great state, and internationally, it will be associated with this tragedy."
Member for Warren Blackwood Terry Redman said the horrific event had hit very close to home for many in his electorate.

"It's the sort of stuff you read about in papers that happens somewhere else, not in our own community, and that's going to take some time to get over," he said.
"We try and get back to business as normal, the community will certainly be endeavouring to do that, and I guess as time goes on you talk a little less about it.
"But it doesn't take away what will be a pretty significant issue in the history of the region and the history of Margaret River."
A father left with nothing but questions
As the people of Margaret River rally together and try to move forward, Mr Cockman questions how he will manage to do the same.
Still very much in shock, he said the true loss of his four young children was still yet to sink in.

Posted
Domestic flights from Melbourne to Sydney are expected to experience delays for most of the day, after New South Wales was hit by a severe dust storm.
The storm has blanketed Sydney airport and many parts of New South Wales, and is said to be the worst to hit the state in nearly 70 years.
Several international flights bound for Sydney have been diverted to Melbourne Airport, while some flights from Tullamarine to Sydney have been delayed by up to five hours.
Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Carly Phillips says some flights have been cancelled altogether.
"It will take us a little time to get things back on schedule," she said.
"Sydney's operating on a limited capacity, so as flights can start to get in there they will, but it will take a little while for things to return to normal.\"""" ;

By Europe correspondent Philip Williams and staff
Updated
An Australian has been killed in a stampede at an outdoor music festival in Germany.
Nineteen people were killed and 45 seriously injured at the Love Parade in the city of Duisburg north of Dusseldorf on Saturday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) says a 27-year-old woman from New South Wales died in the crush of people who surged through an entry tunnel.
A spokesman for DFAT says the Australian Embassy in Berlin is seeking urgent advice from the German authorities to determine whether any other Australians were caught in the stampede.
Witnesses said the trouble started as crowds trying to reach a parade area pushed into people trying to leave.
During the panic, victims fell and were crushed by people trying to flee the area.
At least 10 people were revived at the scene but paramedics and police were too late for many.
Helicopters were used to ferry the injured to local hospitals.
The Love Parade is one of the biggest techno music festivals in the world and used to be held in Berlin.
Police had been concerned about the massive buildup of revellers who were overwhelming the access points to the festival.
They decided to allow the festival to continue, fearing another panic if they tried to call it off.

Djibouti incumbent wins one-man poll
Misanet / IRIN, 12 April
Djibouti's incumbent president, Ismail Omar Guelleh, won 100 percent of the vote in Friday's presidential election - in which he was the sole candidate – according to the official news agency, 'Agence Djiboutienne d'Information' (ADI). President Guelleh will now serve a second and final six-year term as leader of the Horn of Africa nation.
'ADI' reported that 78.9 percent of approximately 197,000 registered voters cast their ballots - at 200 voting booths - across the country. Some 5.7 percent of the votes cast were reported void.
International news agencies said that police had used tear gas on Friday morning to disperse a crowd of between 300 and 500 pro-opposition demonstrators outside the headquarters of the umbrella opposition movement, the Union of Democratic Alliance.
The agencies further reported that opposition parties - which had boycotted the election - had rejected the outcome, describing it as "ridiculous, rigged and rubbish". The Djibouti Human Rights League reportedly said that in reality, many people had not voted.
Members of the opposition were also quoted as saying that official figures depicting a high voter turnout were fraudulent, as turnout was twice that of the 2003 legislative elections when the opposition did not boycott the poll.
President Guelleh's Union for Presidential Majority party won all 65 parliamentary seats in 2003's legislative election, amid opposition accusations of widespread rigging.
International observers from the Arab League and the Francophone Organisation said that Friday's election was conducted under peaceful conditions, and took note of improved operations at polling stations.
President Guelleh, Djibouti's second head of state, was first elected head of the strategic Gulf of Aden nation in 1999, taking over from his uncle, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who had ruled the country since it gained independence from France in 1977. "I regret having no opponent," President Guelleh told the French newspaper 'Le Figaro' in an interview published on Friday.
Djibouti, a country of 700,000, served as an operations base for the US during the 1990-1991 Gulf War, and France continues to have a significant military presence in the country. More recently, the US has stationed hundreds of troops in Djibouti as part of its effort to counter terrorism in the region. Also Germany has troops stationed in the country.
The US State Department has, however, critisised Djibouti's human-rights record, saying that security forces have committed "serious human-rights abuses," and accusing the government of limiting citizens' rights to change their government.
A 2005 US State Department report said that some opposition leaders and the press in Djibouti effectively practiced self-censorship, and refrained from organising popular demonstrations to avoid provoking a government crackdown.

<http://www.aihgs.com/> dct:description """In this hard economic era, companies are trying all possible ways to minimize their overall operational expenditure. One of them is by outsourcing secretarial services. When it comes to areas such as secretarial and administrative tasks, these services are providing great solutions for many companies. Here is a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of relying on both in-house and outsourced company secretarial services, you should know.
Advantages of Outsourced Company Secretarial Services
Outsourced company secretarial services do present a wide variety of value-added benefits, both startups, and established firms.
Cost Efficiency
The biggest benefits of using outsourced secretarial services are the amount of company operational expenditure you can be able to cut down on. To begin with, you won’t have to invest in a comprehensive training program or refresher course for secretaries. You will not have to invest in the normally expensive office equipment that is necessary to retain in-house secretaries. You will also not be obliged to foot regular employee pay and work benefits for secretaries. All of these factors will be the sole responsibility of the company whose services you outsource.
Versatility of Services
Now more than ever, you will be able to outsource any particular secretarial service your company requires at any moment. Most of the most reputable companies who provide these services make it their primary business to retain a team of secretaries who are experts in specific fields of this profession. Some of the most notable are statutory financial returns, tax records maintenance, business paperwork filing, company resolutions preparation to mention but a few. These are extremely specialized skills that can require substantial investment if you decided to employ in-house secretaries.
Enhanced Company Efficiency
It is a well known that outsourcing secretarial services do in fact improve office efficiency. In turn, this improves productivity. These professionals are always dedicated to the projects that are handed to them and will always ensure they perform a professional and exemplary job.
Disadvantages of Outsourced Company Secretarial Services
Finally, outsourcing company secretarial services can prove to be a hindrance to the more established businesses. Like it had been earlier noted, the level of trustworthiness and accountability isn’t always at par. Additionally, you will not have direct control over the duties you delegate to your chosen outsourcing company.
Confidentiality and Trustworthiness
To begin with, the sensitive nature of this job, corporate entities deeply appreciate having secretaries whom they can absolutely trust. Secretaries often have to process very sensitive documents like tax returns, file confidential documents and review secret company resolutions. This means having an in-house set of secretaries they have vetted is an essential consideration.
Accountability and Accessibility
For the more the established business entities, having someone whom they can access on a daily basis is critical. Also, having someone who can always be accountable for his or her actions is also important. This provides the firm assurance that they will always be in a position of having some high level of direct control over the tasks they allocate to them. This cannot be so with outsourced services.
Significant Costs Involved in Retaining In-House Secretaries
First of all, to hire regular in-house secretaries, you will have to make a colossal investment in accessing such services. This includes comprehensively training your secretaries to be able to efficiently undertake the various administrative tasks you set for all. Additionally, you will have invest in the necessary equipment and office space for them to be fully operational. Thirdly, you will have to meet regular human resources expenditure such as salaries, PAYE tax, pensions, sickness pay, and vacation pay. All of these costs can be overwhelming for a startup or even a small business establishment.
In-House Office Politics Influence
With in-house secretaries, there is always a high possibility of petty office politics influencing the quality of work done. Interpersonal employee relationships can make some secretaries prefer working for certain ‘bosses’ than others. Also, the level of confidentiality, as well as discretion, can also have a toll on the way the job is handled.""" ;

<http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/01/davutoglu-says-isis-assad-partners.html#> dct:description """Being an academic versed in international relations, Davutoglu should also have had a better focus on which global and regional powers would support Assad.
In hindsight, that all looks like wishful thinking. Such assumptions also appear seriously off the mark for someone who should have been better informed about the demographic structure of Syria and the depth of the sectarian fault lines in the country.
For Davutoglu, the situation in Syria was simply about a ruthless dictator killing his own people. He never considered the possibility that this crisis had the makings of a civil war, not unlike the one in the former Yugoslavia. Davutoglu’s assumptions were based on the notion that in time, the Syrian regime would fall just like those in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya and be replaced with an elected government.
In a rare admission that things are not going according to his expectations, Davutoglu now acknowledges, albeit indirectly, that the activities of radical Islamists in Syria are making Assad the lesser evil for the international community. This stands in stark contrast with his predictions less than two years ago that Assad had only months, if not weeks, to go.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has rarely been correct in his predictions about Syria. Just about every plan and expectation he had for this country has gone awry in ways he never factored in. Some of his assessments about the current situation appear equally questionable. For example, he is saying now that Turkey's new bane in northern Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), is in league with the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
The situation in Syria also undermines Davutoglu’s claim made on a number of occasions that Turkey understands the region better than most for historic and cultural reasons. This does not appear to be the case from today’s vantage. At any rate, not everyone in the region welcomes such remarks, seeing in them neo-Ottoman ambitions.
Assad is therefore not the only Middle Eastern leader who must be looking with some satisfaction at the corruption scandals and political difficulties the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is embroiled in presently. And there is no love lost for Erdogan on some Arab streets, of course.
The number of governments that want less involvement by Turkey in the region, however, has increased, especially after Erdogan revealed his sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood and pursued policies reflecting sectarian biases. Turkey is trying to work itself out of this corner now by courting Baghdad and leading Shiite figures in Iraq — not to mention Iran — but regaining confidence will take time.
The bottom line for Erdogan and Davutoglu is that Assad remains in power, despite all efforts to oust him by military means. Not only has he survived thus far, but he has also worked himself to the settlement table. Erdogan and Davutoglu are loath to see this, having built their expectations on Assad’s demise. Given the troubles Erdogan faces at home, however, perhaps Assad believes he might even outlive him politically.
All of this is a far cry from Davutoglu’s claim that a day will come when not a leaf will move in the region without Ankara’s approval. “The greatness of a nation is measured by the geography it spreads across, as well as the values it spreads. No one has the right to limit this horizon and geography,” Davutoglu said during an address at a conference in the industrial city of Kocaeli in May.
“If this restoration succeeds as it should, then a leaf cannot move in this geography or in the world without the will of our people,” he added, overlooking the fact that many leaves were already moving in the Middle East at that stage with no input from Turkey. Such remarks were widely met with ridicule among Turks, who see that Turkey has more adversaries and rivals in its region now than in the past.
Meanwhile, aware of the difficulties Turkey is facing in Syria today, Davutoglu seems to have decided on Erdogan’s tactic of finding unlikely causes for some of them. The most urgent problem for Turkey in Syria at the moment is ISIS, which is trying to entrench itself in northern Syria and in Iraq’s Anbar province.
Ankara, it is rumored in diplomatic circles, is currently working with elements close to “moderate” Salafists in the region operating under the banner of the Islamic Front, a Saudi-backed anti-Assad coalition of diverse groups, which is also fighting ISIS for control over northern Syria.
The mysterious truck halted by police in Turkey as it headed for the Syrian border, but which was not allowed to be searched by the government, is thought by many to have contained military equipment for one such group — possibly Syrian Turkmen, judging by remarks from government officials.
The government nevertheless continues to reject accusations by the Assad regime that it is arming Islamic terrorists in Syria — a claim Damascus has also taken to the UN Security Council. In an exclusive interview on Jan. 9 with the semi-official Anadolu News Agency, Davutoglu said these claims were part of a “psychological onslaught against Turkey,” and tried to turn the tables on ISIS and Assad.
“ISIS emerged on the scene and started fighting opposition forces just when the opposition in northern Syria grew strong. There is a partnership behind the curtains between them and the regime. The regime points at these groups and says ‘There is terrorism,’ thus legitimizing itself.” Davutoglu said.
He added that the methods employed by some radical groups were also making Assad seem the lesser evil for a public increasingly fed up with these groups. There is indirect acknowledgment in this remark that Assad is regaining some legitimacy thanks to jihadist groups, which are of grave concern to the West, too.
Discussions with diplomats indicate that the West is also not so sure about some of the groups operating under the Islamic Front, which Ankara is said to be backing, together with Saudi Arabia. An increasingly wary Turkish public is wondering how Turkey will extricate itself from embroilment with these groups in Syria.
Meanwhile, Assad’s compliance with the Russian-brokered plan for his chemical weapons stockpiles has also earned him praise from some Western officials, much to Erdogan and Davutoglu’s annoyance, of course. Ankara, however, has few options left on Syria today other than going with the flow of events it has little or no control over.
On the other hand, the rationale behind some of the arguments coming out of Ankara when faced with undesirable developments in the region does not contribute much to shoring up Turkey’s wavering credibility.""" ;

<http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/turkey-ankara-fear-reigns-after-bloody-bombings.html> dct:description """Fear is palpable across the city, especially in shopping malls, which have become an Ankara hallmark in recent years. Boasting 33 shopping malls, the capital — whose dull landscape pales in comparison to picturesque Istanbul — is often the subject of jokes to the effect that shopping malls are the seafront promenades and picnic sites for Ankara's residents. Jokes aside, the malls attract tens of thousands of people every day, not only for shopping but also for leisure and socializing.
The blast, echoing across the city, targeted a transport hub, claiming 37 lives. The mayhem took residents' fear and panic to new highs, with the press drawing comparisons between Ankara and Baghdad. The daily Cumhuriyet reported that Ankara’s death toll from terrorism since October surpassed those of Beirut, Kabul and Mogadishu.
To soothe jitters, a few days later Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu introduced preparations for a special security plan , but only three weeks later, on March 13, Ankara was thrown into deeper shock after another suicide car bombing, also claimed by the TAK and similar to the previous one. It struck Kizilay Square, the very heart of the city, only 200 meters (0.1 miles) from the Prime Ministry.
The string of attacks began Oct. 10, when two Islamic State (IS) militants blew themselves up in a crowd gathered for a peace rally near the main train station, killing 102 people. Then, on Feb. 17, two suicide bombers from the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), a radical group said to be an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), slammed an explosives-laden ca r into a military bus convoy exiting the barracks a few hundred meters from parliament and the General Staff headquarters. The huge explosion, which killed 29 people, most of them army personnel, was heard across the capital, sending shockwaves among residents.
Ankara was a small provincial town when it became Turkey's capital 93 years ago. Today, it is the country's second-largest city with a population of 5 million. Over the past five months, three massive bombings have struck the city, claiming some 170 lives and leaving residents on tenterhooks. Fears are rife that this once-tranquil city is on its way to becoming another Middle Eastern capital mired in terror and bloodshed.
Al-Monitor visited two of the largest malls on March 16 to feel the pulse of the city. At Ankamall, a largely empty parking lot greeted the eye. Security guards estimated that the number of visitors was “down by at least 50%.” Inside the building, silence reigned in place of the usual bustle. When asked about the missing throngs of shoppers, a cleaner remarked, “How else could it be so clean? If it goes on like this, the economy will collapse, and we’ll be left without jobs. Why is this all happening? Who are we fighting with?”
Two young sales clerks chatted with gloomy faces at a cosmetics counter. It was around 4 p.m., and they had yet to sell anything, they grumbled. In a nearby coffee shop belonging to Turkey’s biggest chain, waiters tended to only five tables. One of them recounted how the packed mall was deserted within two hours after the last bombing.
“Most of the tables would normally be occupied at this hour,” he said. Another waiter chimed in, reproaching the wave of panic and simmering rumors of fresh attacks. “There was supposedly a bomb alert for this shopping mall as well. But I’m not nervous. It could happen anywhere. Plus, if people are already talking about it, [the bombers] would no longer do it here even if they intended to,” he said.
A couple of kilometers away, the outdoor parking area of the Armada mall also had plenty of vacant spots. Its food court, usually jam-packed, was similarly quiet. Chats with employees revealed two prevailing feelings: The third bombing had a much more traumatic effect than the previous ones, and the return of the crowds will take longer.
In the office wing of the building, an employee on his way home said, “Almost all the offices have been deserted. I work with foreigners, and they are all gone as well. What has become of our country?”
I then went to the store of a friend who is a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Neither she nor any customers were around. In a brief telephone conversation, she said that business had been bad for some time now, and the bombing rubbed salt into the wound. She seemed to put little responsibility on the government, however, instead blaming the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), which the AKP accuses of collaborating with the PKK. “I just can’t tell you how angry I am with all those who voted for the HDP!” she said.
Some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away, the scene of the third bombing, Kizilay Square, was unprecedented. It was around 6:30 p.m., rush hour, the time at which the bombers had struck. Ankara’s main juncture — through which some 1 million people pass on a normal day — looked almost unrecognizable with so few people. One could even count the pedestrians waiting at traffic lights. The shattered storefronts facing the explosion remained covered.
Farther uptown, Tunali Hilmi, one of Ankara’s liveliest avenues, lacked both its pedestrian throngs and traffic crawling at the pace of a turtle. More than half of the shops were closed. In the ones that remained open, one could discern only gloom, making one ask, “Where is this going to end?”
The entertainment sector has also been badly hit. Irfan Demirkol, owner of the largest cinema in the Kizilay area, told Al-Monitor, “No one came on the first day [after the blast], so we canceled all the screenings. It’s the second day that we’ve closed all the halls again. We are waiting for the fear and panic to pass. After the previous bombings, it took three or four days. The bus stop, where the blast occurred, is used both by our employees and customers. This alone can explain how frightened we are. This is not about personal or corporate concerns, but we want the country to be a safe place because small businesses suffer the most.”
Orhan Karsak, who owns a plaza with more than 100 shops in Kizilay, said, “Shopkeepers can’t do business because people are staying at home. As a result, they start asking for rent discounts or expect sacrifices from employees. We had just begun to return to normal after the second blast, and now we are back to ground zero.” The government should activate support facilities designed for extraordinary circumstances, he stressed, “or else small shopkeepers will crash.”
The regional manager of a popular retail chain, who requested anonymity, said, “Everyone is in a panic. Friends are calling to urge me to stay at home, speaking of bomb alerts. The real danger, however, is that people seem to acquiesce to this state of affairs. Same with us. We are supposed to call clients and make sales, but one feels psychological pressure, like ‘What am I after?’ The customers’ return to the shopping malls will take much longer this time.”""" ;

Imagine your posturing self-assurance as you parade on the dockside at Port Melbourne, dressed in the finest fashions the colony of Port Phillip can offer. Your beautiful new bride is elegantly bubbling beside you whilst showing off the latest copy of high Paris couture. Yes, my boy, you have made it! The year is 1859.
You came to the Victorian goldfields a pauper and struck it rich. You look across the bay to Frankston, Mount Martha, Dromana and Tubbarrubba where shortly even more goldfields will be pegged out. This was an era like no other and rags to riches were common, with no conniving government tax collectors to strip you of your 'Paul Hogan' fortune.
Now with ritzy wealth reflected in your grand finery, you are boarding the luxurious steam clipper 'Royal Charter' to fast tack up Port Phillip Bay and head home to England. Doubtless the gentry will fawn over your new found colonial riches.
This sleek iron sailing ship is a modern technical marvel. She is the fastest steam clipper in the world and on this trip she will break the Melbourne to England record by touching down in 58 days. Built for the Australian run, she is 80 meters long and weighs 3000 tonnes. She is carrying 388 passengers and 112 crew. But what else? This is a 'gold' ship. She is bursting with over 70,000 ounces of gold ($98 million today), 48,000 newly minted sovereigns, and the personal gold wealth (uncalculated) of passengers who struck it rich on the Victorian goldfields.
As you steam by Perth on September 1, 1859 all the passengers are delighted by an incredible phenomena. It is the 'Aurora Australis', but one so bright it lights up the night as if it were day. The captain, Thomas Taylor, notes he has never seen an Aurora this close to the equator before.
Skies all over planet Earth erupted in red, green, and purple auroras so brilliant that newspapers could be read as easily as in daylight. On the other side of the world, a brilliant Aurora Borealis is seen as far south as the Caribbean and Hawaii. This was the largest geo-magnetic storm ever recorded (NASA). Telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed. Telegraph pylons threw sparks and telegraph paper spontaneously caught fire. But this was only the first portent from the heavens.
Just two months earlier a massive earthquake had occurred in Erzurum, Turkey, of force 9 on the Mercalli scale. Over 16 thousand people had perished. Was there a strange connection between these two events? But even stranger coincidences were to follow.
The rest of the 'Royal Charter's' journey was pure bliss. The luxury cabins were a delight. The company boisterous and the sharing of 'wealth laden' future dreams enervating. As she beat down towards the English Channel all seemed well. But when she reached the north-western tip of Anglesey, on October 25, the barometer was dropping. The master, Captain Thomas Taylor, was advised to put into Holyhead harbor for shelter but he continued on to Liverpool.
During the night of October, the winds rose to Hurricane force 12 at over 160 kmh, in what became known as the 'Royal Charter' gale. Its direction changed from E to NNE, driving the ship towards the coast of Anglesey.
At 11 p.m. she anchored, but at 1.30 a.m. on October 26 the port anchor chain snapped, rapidly followed by the starboard. Despite cutting the masts to reduce the drag of the wind, the 'Royal Charter' was driven inshore, with the steam engines unable to make headway against the gale. The ship initially grounded on a sandbank, but in the early morning the rising tide drove her to the rocks.
Battered against the rocks by huge waves whipped up by winds of over 160 kilometers per hour, she quickly broke up. Most of the passengers and crew, a total of over 450 people, died. Many of them were killed by being dashed against the rocks by the waves rather than drowned. Others were drowned, weighed down by the belts of gold they were wearing around their bodies. The survivors, 21 passengers and 18 crew members, were all men, with no women or children saved.
The 'Royal Charter' storm was the worst of the entire nineteenth century with a total of 133 ships sunk during the storm. The death toll was around 800. What had caused this unprecedented megastorm? I believe we can look to another event that shows us precisely where our weather comes from.
In the heavens, the solar superstorm of 1859, also known as the 'Carrington Event', was the most powerful solar storm in recorded history. Richard Carrington sketched its magnitude whilst observing the bright flashes of a solar flare on the surface of the sun.
This was the same event that caused the disruption of telegraphs, the extreme glow of the Aurora Australis, earthquakes in Turkey, and finally the massively destructive 'Royal Charter' mega-storm. Quite probably 'synchrotron' radiation poured down on Earth. Tempel's observations came shortly thereafter, when he sketched an enormous Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), with its terrible body blooming out as far as the width of the sun itself, during a solar eclipse a few months later. The electromagnetic connection with the sun controls our weather, not puny mankind with his imagined impact.
One more phenomena occurred that is painfully coincidental and baffles modern science. The world wide flu epidemic of 1859 was one of the worst ever, causing half a million deaths (Duffy. J.- Louisiana University press). Could solar flares and the CME's synchrotron radiation stimulate viral growth?
As for the gold, many an Anglesey resident became rich overnight, and to this day salvage divers seek to recover some of the wealth with no success.
Note: Whilst filming on the Jurassic coast in England, I spoke to one of these professionals involved in the last attempt in 2005. Expert salvage diver John Ledger gave me some souvenirs from his incredible memorabilia. A few lead balls of rifle buckshot, a broken plate and some 'Royal Charter' ship's rivets. These I have with me as I type this tragic tale - a sad legacy that has returned to Melbourne some 150 years later.

On-again, off-again nature of talk about 2002 Gujarat riots, on the heels of Godhra carnage, is preposterous. It is outrageous and disgusting to raise such issues, rendered irrelevant with the passage of time, to tarnish the image of India, booming with economic activity. It is disrespectful to the nation of one billion people.
The so-called ‘Tehelka expose’ has, in fact, exposed the hollowness of pseudo-secularists, who flourish on such ‘gossip’. Such loose discussions, brought to the fore repeatedly, should be put to an end once for all. The drum-beaters of secularism are deliberately orchestrating of what they call ‘sting operation’, when the Assembly elections in Gujarat are approaching. It is the height of stupidity to claim that the ‘expose’ just ‘coincided’ with the announcement of the Assembly poll in Gujarat.
In the first instance, such ‘exposures’ are politically-motivated. The ‘power hungry’ Congress politicians know when and how to operationalise their ‘mischievous designs’, how to indulge in dirty tricks and how to mould public opinion. They raise the bogey of Gujarat riots, without bothering to mention about Godhra mayhem, in which 58 Hindu Kar Sevaks were roasted alive while they were traveling in the Sabarmati Express. The reaction to Godhra was Gujarat riots.
The question is what was the need to reopen healed up wounds. If it was needed at all, why ‘publicity’ was not given to these killings six months earlier? What was done is done; cannot be undone. No sane person will gloat over the killings or justify them.
But raising such issues repeatedly cannot be justified. More so since the secularists across the country did not bother to talk about the gruesome killings of nearly 1200 Kashmiri Hindus in early 1990 and later in sporadic incidents of ethnic cleansing. These killings and the resultant mass exodus of 5, 00,000 Hindus from Kashmir Valley are a blot on the Indian democracy.
Hardly 15,000 Hindus are left in the valley now. Have they no right to live in their land of birth? Have they no democratic rights? The Human Rights organizations and the Amnesty International are just feigning ignorance about the apathetic conditions of the Kashmiri Hindus. So far the Indian Government’s internal policy priorities are concerned human rights of Kashmiri Pundits have been locked in the boot.
Since there is so much talk about post-Godhra carnage by secularists, may I ask them why they are not equally strident in the case of Kashmiri Hindus’ plight. Why don’t they pause for a while to wonder what was the fault of the Kashmiri Hindus to be marginalised and neglected in their own country? What crime had they committed against the majority Muslim community in the Valley?
After the mass exodus, their houses were looted and set on fire. Temples and other places of worship were burnt down. The Hindus were compelled to dispose off their properties at throwaway prices, so that they don’t dare to return to the Valley. Is this secularism? Is this democracy? No eyebrows were raised about the pogrom of the Kashmiri Hindus.
For Kashmiri Hindus, secularism has been buried in the graveyards of Kashmir. The moderate Muslims were helpless as the radicals are holding the sway. And they just advised the ‘Hindu brethren’ to leave for lack of security.
To cap it all, some maverick writers believe that killings of Muslims in Gujarat, as exposed by Tehelka, should not be suppressed. Does it mean, what has happened to Kashmiri Hindus and non-Kashmiri Hindus, who had also settled there for decades, should be suppressed? It is shameful. Why was not any commission set up to go into the killings and forcible exodus of Kashmiri Hindus?
Why are there one-sided sting operations? Is it not a new weapon in the hands of the secularists to divide the society on communal lines, keeping in mind the vote bank policy?
The authorities in Godhra, soon after the mayhem, had made an unsavoury statement that those who had burnt alive the karsevaks were “uneducated, without jobs and poor. Most of them, called Ghanchi Muslims, live in poverty and have no economic activity” How amazing? The Godhra officials were forced to make confusing statements to suppress the truth about Godhra.
These tactics are sure to boomerang and destroy the age-old residual communal harmony. They should realize such exposures will retaliate on them, just like terrorism has boomeranged on Pakistan. Dr Sachidananda Sinha has well said: “Where there is no vision, the people perish”.
Maverick writer Farzana Versey argues that the cause of Kashmiri Hindus has been romanticized. In a recent news paper article, “Fission Kashmir” (September 7, 2007) she remarks: “Unlike the 140 terrorist groups, the Pandit lobby is strong. It can organize itself. Displaced Pundits are now demanding reservations in the Jammu and Kashmir legislature and government jobs, as well as setting up of three townships in the Valley for their rehabilitation”. What is wrong in making these demands?
Unlike Versey, some Pakistan journalists appear to sympathise with Kashmiri Pundits. They visited the migrant camps in Jammu and saw things for themselves. They have taken up the cudgels for speaking the truth. For the past 17 years, the Pundit community has lost its cultural moorings. They have lost their identity as an ethnic group, and are unable to preserve their traditions and customs.
Some Indian journalists are talking about ‘nailing the guilty of Gujarat’. Their response is based on Tehelka’s investigations, which, according to them, has ‘provided evidence on tapes ‘of stories relating to the Muslims’ killings by top functionaries of the BJP and Sangh Parivar.
Well, if that is indeed the case, what about nailing known JKLF activist Bitta Karatay, who, in a recent TV interview had claimed responsibility for killing scores of Hindus, with many more on his hit-list. He was in jail for 16 years on the charge of murdering a score of Kashmiri Hindus.
The Supreme Court has released Karatay recently for ‘want of evidence’.

<http://www.axs.com/how-miami-s-ultra-music-festival-became-a-worldwide-phenomenon-45274> dct:description """The Ultra Music Festival is one of the world’s biggest showcases of DJ’s and electronic music, and over the years, the festival has grown to be a worldwide event, with cities around the world getting in on the Ultra festivities that sets Miami el fuego every year.
So how did Ultra get to the point where it is now a worldwide phenomenon? For the answer to that question, you have to go back to 1999, the year the festival was founded by Miami business partners Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes.
The festival was named in honor Depeche Mode’s hit 1997 album, Ultra, and on March 13 of that year, at the end of the annual Winter Music Conference, the first Ultra Music Festival was underway. At the time, Ultra was just a one-day affair, and the first ever artists to play at the festival included Josh Wink and DJ Baby Anne.
The first Ultra was on South Beach, at Collins Park, which provided a tropical and known location for music fans. The first festival was a success, as over 10,000 concertgoers converged on South Beach to attend the event, but the duo who put the concert together lost nearly $20,000 that year on the festival.
So, for the 2000 edition, the duo partnered with Coolworld Entertainment, which provided stable financial backing, and the event was even more successful. Due to the increased attendance, the organizers decided that Collins Park was not large enough to handle the festival’s rising popularity; so for the 2001 edition, they moved it from South Beach to downtown Miami’s Bayfront Park, which provided an equally scenic atmosphere, but with larger space to accommodate larger crowds; and from that point on, the festival took off.
Ultra got so big, that other cities around the world were interested in partnering with the organizers to host their own Ultra festivities. The first international city to join in on the event was Ibiza, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea near Spain, in 2007; and from there, other cities joined in on the party, which included Sao Paulo (2008), Seoul (2012), Johannesburg/Cape Town (2014), and Tokyo (2014).
Although Ultra has expanded worldwide, the main festival still resides in Miami, and it is here every March that the Magic City becomes the worldwide epicenter for electronic music.""" ;

<http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1084202/exclusive-ultra-music-ultra-music-festival-announce-global> dct:description """Ultra Music and Ultra Music Festival (UMF) will announce today that they are joining forces in what is being called a "global alliance," Billboard.biz has learned. The two companies will form one of the most powerful independent entities in electronic dance music (EDM), linking Ultra Music artists like Deadmau5, Steve Aoki and Calvin Harris with UMF, the world's biggest EDM event brand (with six festivals worldwide) - in a time when many players, small to large, are selling to corporations.
"I think we've both come to a realization that a stronger link between different music areas make the combined Ultra brand even stronger," Ultra Music President Patrick Moxey told Billboard.biz exclusively. "We have various new CDs and DVDs which will be coming out to support the expansion of the live music experience that [UMF co-founder and CEO] Russell [Faibisch] is setting up around the world. We have many new technology ideas we are discussing, but certainly we want to innovate to bridge the gap between the live experience and the recorded music experience around electronic dance music."
Ultra Music Fest Expanding To Six International Sites
On their own, the two Ultras are bastions of EDM independence: Ultra Music, Moxey's record label, publishing house, management company and media platform in one, with an artist roster that ranges from underground (Bloody Beetroots) to mainstream (Pitbull and Calvin Harris); and UMF, the original Miami EDM super-festival, which has grown to six events internationally (including this month's inaugural UMF Korea, the country's biggest EDM event ever with over 60,000 attendees; and UMF Chile, which was just announced this week). But together, they form a uniquely potent platform, one able to take an artist from unknown, to chart and festival fodder in a single deal; and able to hold its own against increasingly hefty, corporate-backed competition.
While traveling through China, Faibisch sent Billboard.biz an email with his thoughts on the partnership: "With Ultra Music being the world's #1 independent edm label, and Ultra Music Festival being the world's premiere edm festival, together with our existing businesses and the expansion that each of us is undertaking, we believe the Ultra brand offers something that absolutely no other edm brand can," he wrote. "A wide array of premium products, services and content including festivals/live events, record label services, film/video productions, live streams, original online TV programming and more."
Ultra Music Teams With Wynn Las Vegas For New Label, Releases Featuring Afrojack, Avicii, deadmau5, More
If it's a proactive move, the timing couldn't be better, as corporate entities like Live Nation and Robert F.X. Sillerman have been snapping up everything from U.K. festival brand Cream, to Donnie Estinopal's scrappy middle-America promotion company Disco Donnie Presents, with new acquisitions seemingly announced weekly. "We are in a time when corporations are aggressively buying their way into our scene "brand by brand," Faibisch said. "And we choose not to sell out, but instead are coming together to strengthen one another."
The alliance adds to Ultra Music's recent deal with Wynn Resorts, the hotel group that's been instrumental in making EDM the soundtrack to Las Vegas. That partnership will include compilation releases branded for Wynn's four nightlife venues, as well as video content and distribution on Ultra's popular YouTube channel.
Two Questions at a Bar With Ultra Music's Patrick Moxey @ MIDEM
For UMF's part it also has its own YouTube channel (UMF TV) as well as a SiriusXM radio show (UMF Radio) and its own film company which recently released the film "Can U Fell It' (UMF Films).
News of the union might come as a surprise to those who thought that the Ultras were always all one (never true); and to others who thought them at odds (they have worked together in the past): There was a court case over use of the name in the early 2000s - Moxey founded Ultra Music (then Ultra Records) in 1996, while Faibisch and partner Alex Omes founded UMF in 1999 - but neither party has ever been willing to speak to it, and given today's announcement, it seems moot.
Ultra Music Fest 2012: 10 Things Seen & Heard Friday
"We are very excited about this new stage of collaboration between Ultra Music and Ultra Music Festival," said Moxey. "Everything remains the same with our two separate companies but we both believe this alliance benefits the growth of the Ultra brand."
"It is a win-win situation for everyone." added Faibisch.""" ;

<http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/06/03/victims_lament_massachusetts_tornadoes_huge_toll/> dct:description """The town was filled yesterday with the sound of buzz saws and the squeaking of metal gutters blowing in the wind, and it smelled of sawdust, pine, and gasoline. Downed trees covered entire streets.
“I don’t think there’s any question that we’re in the tens of millions’’ of dollars in damage, said Kerry, who joined Patrick and US Senator Scott Brown at a morning press conference across the street from the First Church of Monson Congregational, which lost its steeple and was one of at least 77 buildings severely damaged in town.
He did not provide a figure, although Senator John F. Kerry earlier yesterday estimated that the state’s damages are enormous.
State and federal officials were tabulating the damage, and Patrick said that total would probably be presented to federal officials in a request for aid within weeks.
He said there were no reports of missing persons.
Most of the damage occurred in fewer than half of the 19 communities hit by the tornadoes, Patrick said. He confined his emergency declaration to those eight or nine towns and cities. He said the 1,000 National Guard troops he ordered to duty spent the day in those communities, helping direct traffic and maintain security, remove debris, conduct well-being checks, and search for survivors in the hardest-hit areas.
“To all of those who have been touched by this, who had their lives turned upside down . . . I just want to assure you that you’re not alone,’’ he said.
Patrick noted the heroism of a woman who died while protecting her daughter in West Springfield and said he had a message for Bay State residents who suffered losses.
Officials said at least 200 people were injured and about 290 people remained in shelters yesterday, roughly half the number who sought refuge on Wednesday. About 40,000 homes and businesses remained without power through yesterday afternoon.
“We are now in effect transitioning from life safety response and search and rescue to the assessment and recovery and cleanup work,’’ Governor Deval Patrick said in an afternoon news conference yesterday at the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framingham.
The violent storm, which killed at least three people, spawned three tornadoes that destroyed nearly 200 buildings in West Springfield, Monson, and Springfield, and many other buildings across the region, authorities said. One of four people reported to have died as a result of the tornadoes on Wednesday was an elderly man in Springfield who suffered a heart attack before the powerful storms struck, local police said.
SPRINGFIELD — A day after deadly tornadoes ripped through Central and Western Massachusetts, dozens of injured residents were recovering in hospitals, hundreds were homeless, and tens of thousands remained without power.
In West Springfield, local police said Angelica Guerrero, 39, died while huddling over her 15-year-old daughter in the family’s bathtub as the storm destroyed their home. The daughter survived.
Police said a tree killed Sergey Livchin, 23, when it fell and crushed a car in the city.
“If you take a look at the destruction down there, it’s amazing that there weren’t more deaths,’’ said West Springfield Police Chief Thomas Burke. “In the 41 years that I’ve been here, I’ve never seen anything like this.’’
Mayor Ed Gibson said the tornado struck a 2-square-mile area in West Springfield, injuring at least 13 people who were transported to a local hospital. At least 88 buildings were destroyed, officials said.
In Brimfield, crews began removing thousands of felled trees, repairing hundreds of yards of downed power lines, and sifting through dozens of demolished homes.
At the Village Green Family Campground off Route 20, where authorities said a woman died after her mobile home was tossed in the air, some upturned trailers had been crushed by fallen trees.
Lester Twarowski, 50, the campground owner, said all 97 trailers on the campground were destroyed.
At the Brimfield Elementary School, where an emergency shelter had been set up, town residents hugged each other and lamented the destruction of their homes.
Kimberly Ladue, 47, said she had just left home when the storm hit. When she returned yesterday, she was astounded by the devastation.
“It looks like a nuclear holocaust,’’ Ladue said. She said that the 400 acres of forest behind her house are “almost obliterated’’ and that a tree fell through her bedroom window.
Ladue described her home as “unlivable,’’ and she wasn’t sure what to do. She had recently renovated the house and had spent years grooming the gardens. “It’s so devastating,’’ she said. “I’m at a loss. I’m at an absolute loss.’’
Don Johnson, 70, said his three-bedroom Cape was a total loss. He said wind blew the house off its foundation, moving the structure about 7 feet. No one was home at the time.
“Forty-five years I’ve lived there,’’ he said. “Raised . . . three families, grandkids and great grandkids.’’
Phil Carpenter, Brimfield’s director of emergency management, said about 60 people came through the elementary school shelter on Wednesday night.
“There’s some horror stories,’’ he said. He was advising people to call their insurance companies.
In Westfield, Mayor Dan Knapik said about 100 homes suffered damage and at least 10 of them are uninhabitable. He said hundreds of utility poles and trees were down and more than 100 vehicles were damaged.
He said the Munger Hill Elementary School suffered a direct hit and would remain closed indefinitely, because much of its roof and many classrooms were destroyed.
“Compared to other cities, we’re incredibly lucky,’’ he said. “I’m stunned and amazed we didn’t have a loss of life.’’
At a press conference yesterday morning at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mayor Domenic J. Sarno and other local officials said about 250 residents had sought shelter the night before at the MassMutual Center, and five of the 35 people treated for injuries were in critical condition. A Hampden assistant district attorney suffered a fractured skull when she was hit by flying bricks as she left the Hampden County Hall of Justice.
“What occurred here is unprecedented,’’ Sarno said of Springfield, where at least 35 buildings were lost.
Sergeant John Delaney of the Springfield Police Department said there were eight arrests in Springfield from the time the storm hit through yesterday evening, compared with 30 on an average day.
He said some roads in the East Forest Park neighborhood remained inaccessible yesterday because of fallen trees; hundreds of homes there suffered damage.
In the neighborhood, Jim Graham sat on the steps of what had been the lovingly renovated home where, 24 hours earlier, he and his wife had expected to spend the rest of their lives.
A beer by his side and a cellphone at his ear, Graham, 44, spoke with an insurance adjuster about the next step in a life stripped of all material belongings.
The roof had been ripped off the kitchen of his two-bedroom home. His garage was reduced to splinters, and his street was an obstacle course of uprooted trees that resembled giant match sticks.
“It doesn’t even look like a house; it looks like a war zone,’’ Graham said. “I don’t know whether to cry, scream, or jump up and down.’’

<http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/02/16/survivor_ala_prof_in_slayings_shot_methodically/> dct:description """The Norfolk County district attorney at the time was William Delahunt, now a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts. He was traveling in the Middle East and did not reply to repeated requests for comment.
John Polio, who headed the Braintree police force at the time, at first defended the handling of the case. The 87-year-old said Tuesday that he recently read a 1987 report on the investigation written by a state trooper. At the time, he had not seen the document. But now, he says, "I would have wanted a lot more questions answered."
She was caught but never charged. Police said it took 11 days before they could interview family members because they were so distraught. When they finally did, authorities decided to let her go, declaring the whole thing an accident.
But police and witnesses say she fled with the gun to a car dealership, where she pointed it at employees and demanded a getaway car. She told them her husband was going to come after her and she needed to flee.
She told police she thought she had ruined the kitchen, but did not realize she had hit her brother. She said she ran away and thought she dropped the gun, which went off a third time. She did not remember anything else until she was taken to a police station.
She said the gun went off again as Seth, a Northeastern University freshman and a virtuoso violinist, walked across the kitchen.
Bishop said she accidentally fired the gun in her bedroom as she tried to unload it, then went downstairs to ask her brother to help, according to a police report.
Bishop's father later told police he and his daughter had a disagreement and she went to her room. She said she had wanted to learn to load a shotgun her parents had bought after a recent break-in.
The story started more than two decades ago when police were called to the Braintree, Mass., home Bishop shared with her parents. Authorities found her 18-year-old brother, Seth, dead of a shotgun wound to the chest.
In the days since Friday's shooting, revelations about Amy Bishop's past have raised questions about whether much of the violence could have been prevented. In the latest twist, police said Tuesday that Bishop had also been charged with assaulting a woman in 2002 during a tirade over a child's booster seat at a restaurant.
Now, a quarter-century later, Amy Bishop is accused in another shooting -- an attack that killed three fellow biology professors at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.—When a young woman in Massachusetts killed her brother with a shotgun blast in 1986, authorities waited more than a week to question family members and the death was ultimately ruled an accident.
The current district attorney, William Keating, said Tuesday that newly found police reports show there was probable cause to arrest Bishop in 1986 on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.
But, Keating said, the reports do not contradict accounts that the shooting was an accident.
Bishop and her husband, James Anderson, graduated from Northeastern in 1988 with biology degrees. In 1993, Bishop earned a doctorate in genetics from Harvard.
That same year, she and her husband were questioned in another unsettling episode: Two mail bombs were sent to a Harvard professor she worked with at Children's Hospital Boston. The explosives did not go off.
Anderson told The Associated Press he and his wife were among a number of innocent people questioned by investigators who cast a wide net. He said the case "had a dozen people swept up in this, and everybody was a subject, not a suspect."
"There was never any indictment, arrest, nothing, and then everyone was cleared after five years," he said.
Anderson also said his wife had been writing a novel at the time that was reviewed by law enforcement. The Boston Globe, citing a law enforcement source it did not identify, reported that it was about a woman who had killed her brother and was hoping to make amends by becoming a great scientist.
But Anderson said the novel was not autobiographical.
"It was just a novel. A medical thriller is the best way to describe it," he said.
Then in 2002, Bishop was charged with assault, battery and disorderly conduct after a 2002 tirade at the International House of Pancakes in Peabody, Mass. Peabody police Capt. Dennis Bonaiuto said that Bishop became incensed when she found out another woman had received the restaurant's last booster seat. Bishop hit the woman while shouting, "I am Dr. Amy Bishop," according to the police report.
Bonaiuto said Bishop admitted to the assault in court, and the case was adjudicated -- meaning the charges were eventually dismissed.
Bishop and Anderson moved to Huntsville in 2003, where they were raising their four children. Bishop appeared to be a rising star at the university -- she developed a new type of portable cell incubator and won $25,000 in a statewide business competition in 2007. She appeared, smiling, on the cover of a local tech magazine that touted her advances.
But she was denied tenure by the university, and she was vocal among colleagues about her displeasure over being forced to look for work elsewhere after this semester.
Bishop also filed a complaint last year alleging gender discrimination by the university. The university denied the allegations, which are in a complaint pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint itself, filed Sept. 15, was not immediately available.
Joseph Ng, an associate professor who worked with Bishop in the biology department, was in the cramped faculty conference room when gunfire erupted Friday afternoon during a monthly meeting.
About a dozen teachers and staff members were sitting elbow-to-elbow at a long table when Ng heard the "pop-pop-pop" of a 9 mm handgun.
He watched several of his colleagues go down, starting with the ones close to Bishop. He and the rest of the survivors dived under the table desperate for cover. Three people were wounded.
Within seconds, the shooting stopped. During the lull, Debra Moriarity, a biochemistry professor, scrambled toward Bishop and urged her to stop, he said.
Bishop aimed at Moriarity and attempted to fire, but the gun did not go off. Moriarity then led the charge that forced Bishop out the door into a hallway. Her colleagues barricaded themselves in the room, and Bishop was arrested moments later outside the building.
"Moriarity was probably the one that saved our lives. She was the one that initiated the rush," Ng said. "It took a lot of guts to just go up to her."
On Tuesday, the 44-year-old Bishop was under extra guard at an Alabama jail. Students and victims' relatives want to know how someone with such a tortured past could ever have been hired at a state university.
"Do they not do background checks on teachers? How did all this slip through the cracks?" nursing student Caitlin Phillips asked.
University President David B. Williams defended the decision to hire Bishop. He said a review of her personnel file and her hiring file raised no red flags.
Police ran a criminal background check Monday, after she was charged with one count of capital murder and three counts of attempted murder.
"Even now, nothing came up," Williams said.

Author Luke Waterson has drawn inspiration from the story of Cardigan Castle
A PRINCE who prized bards above bloodshed – that is Lord Rhys according to a West Country author who is publishing a novel on the first eisteddfod next month.
Somerset-born Luke Waterson has been fascinated by the landscape and history of Wales since he was a small boy – but it is the story of Cardigan Castle and that first eisteddfod in 1176 that has inspired his latest novel Song Castle.
“The fact that Lord Rhys and Cardigan Castle was a beacon for culture in an era that was renowned for its bloodshed is just compelling,” he said.
“I’ve always wanted to write a big novel on Welsh history. The story is not just about the festival but also the journey of the people who came to Cardigan Castle that Christmas of 1176.
“We know that bards came from all over Britain and France but is it possible they came from further afield?
“In my novel I have a character journeying to Cardigan from Persia. Could that have been possible? They came to Wales not for war, not for fighting but for poetry.”
Luke will be giving a talk on his book and the first eisteddfod at Cardigan Castle on Thursday, 26 April, at 6pm – two days before the 821st anniversary of Lord Rhys’s death.
“The few sentences that are written about what we now know as the first eisteddfod are tantalisingly short,” he said, “but we do know that this festival attracted people from all over the known world.”

Darren Bernhardt, Saskatchewan News Network; CanWest News Service Published:Â Thursday, January 11, 2007
SASKATOON -- It will go down as one of the most intense blizzards in the city's history, claiming the lives of two people on a reserve and grinding Saskatoon to a virtual halt.
"We're ranking right up there with a first-class Prairie blizzard," said Environment Canada's Larry Flysak. "It's an extreme event. We've got it all. It's something we'll always remember."
A motorist and a tow truck driver discovered the bodies of two people along an access road on the Onion Lake First Nation just after 10 a.m. An 18-year-old man and 38-year-old woman, both residents of Onion Lake First Nation, were caught in the blizzard and died from exposure after attempting to walk home from their vehicle, say RCMP.
The only Saskatoon storm in the past half-century that comes close to Wednesday's occurred Dec. 12, 1955. It lasted 26 hours with winds hitting 121 kilometres per hour and leaving nine centimetres of snow behind. The 2007 blizzard began around midnight Jan. 10 and grew stronger through the day with winds pushing 90 kilometres per hour and snow totals around 25 centimetres by 6 p.m., with more to come.
"It's tough to calculate newly fallen snow in a blizzard because it's blowing around so much," said Flysak.
The blizzard obliterates the single-day snowfall record for Jan. 10 in Saskatoon. The greatest accumulation recorded on this date was 10.2 centimetres in 1938.
Since 1953 there have been 18 blizzards recorded in the city but other than in 1955, none compare to the snow and duration of Wednesday's blast, though Edward William "Ted" Meeres might disagree.
He died at age 27 after being trapped in an 1888 blizzard, making his way home from a neighbour's house on the spacious Prairie. He wanted to check his livestock and lost his way. The location today is approximately the corner of Broadway Avenue and 10th Street.
Almost 120 years later, Mother Nature has proven she still wields power. Abandoned vehicles littered the city Wednesday, paralysed by the snow and poor visibility.
All branches of the public library closed in the afternoon as did city leisure facilities, indoor skating rinks and public schools. Several businesses were allowing their employees to go home early while the University of Saskatchewan shut down along with SIAST Kelsey campus and government agencies.
All services are expected to resume at U of S today, although classes will be held at the discretion of the colleges. SIAST expected to reopen classes today.
About 40 staff and students at U of S were planning to spend the night on campus in residence lounges. Some public schools students were also contemplating nights away from home.
Students riding a bus from Mount Royal Collegiate found themselves unable to get home and were taken to Dundonald School for the night.
Public schools spokeswoman Joy Adams Bauer said school administrators will staff any school housing students overnight. Contingency plans are in effect and officials are making sleeping arrangements and providing food.
At Centennial Collegiate, assistant principal Tom Sargeant was busy pushing cars out of the snow in the school's parking lot. Forty students were stranded at the collegiate into the evening, waiting to see if they could get home. "Until the last student leaves, I'll be here," Sargeant said.""" ;

Quebec and eastern Ontario were slammed with a nasty mix of snow, rain and wind Monday, leaving thousands without power as a fierce spring storm barrelled up from the U.S. eastern seaboard.
Snowfall and high winds knocked tree branches down in Quebec City Monday morning.
(CBC)
More than 100,000 Quebec households still don't have electricity, as heavy winds and wet snow knocked out sections of the province's power grid.
In eastern Ontario, more than 20,000 customers were without power as of noon Monday, with blackouts reported in Kingston, Brockville, Perth, Winchester and Vankleek Hill.
The worst-hit areas include Quebec's Lanaudière and Laurentian regions. Blackouts were also reported in Gatineau, Quebec City, Laval, Montreal, the Eastern Townships and the Outaouais.
Hydro-Québec was forced to cut power in some areas in order to complete repair work on damaged lines, said spokeswoman Flavie Côté.
"There are some times when our teams have to go on site and create a secure zone to be able to work on the distribution system, which means no electricity will go through the lines for a certain period of time," she told CBC.
The massive spring storm also forced several Quebec schools to close for the day, including Lanaudière and Laurentian area schools in the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board.
Other schools closed on Monday include Joliette elementary and high schools in Lanaudière, Rawdon elementary and middle schools, Franklin Hill Elementary in Repentigny, Morin Heights Elementary and Ste-Agathe elementary and high schools.
Significant accumulation in the forecast
Between 15 and 25 centimetres of wet and heavy snow are expected to fall in Cornwall and Prescott, Ont., according to Environment Canada.
In Ottawa, members of Parliament returning from a two-week Easter break will be greeted by 30 to 50 millimetres of rain and snow.
In Montreal and southern Quebec, between 12 and 20 centimetres of slushy snow fell overnight, according to Environment Canada, with more to come in the Laurentians and Lanaudière.
Quebec City, meanwhile, had wind warnings for northeasterly gusts that were expected to blast at up to 90 km/h Monday, with five to 10 centimetres of wet snow expected before the day's end.
The wet snow is causing significant water accumulation on highways, and Transport Quebec officials are warning drivers to slow down and allow for extra braking time.
Storm echoes in Maritimes
The snow won't push into the Maritimes, although New Brunswick is expected to get 60 millimetres of rain and some strong winds.
As well, a storm surge warning is in effect for an area stretching from Halifax to Yarmouth.
The storm coming into Canada made its way through the eastern United States from New York, which was bombarded by rain Sunday.
At least one person died and hundreds of flights were cancelled along the U.S. eastern seaboard Sunday as a result of the storm.
That's on top of the five deaths blamed on the same storm system as it swept through the Plains on Friday and Saturday.
Authorities in South Carolina said one person was killed and four seriously injured when high winds damaged dozens of homes in Sumter County.
Airlines cancelled more than 500 flights at the New York area's three major airports.
The storm also forced the cancellation of five major league baseball games.
More than 140 millimetres of rain had fallen in the New York region by Sunday night and up to 150 millimetres more was predicted to fall by the morning.
Authorities warn that high tide is likely to bring coastal flooding on Long Island, where falling tree limbs have cut off power to 1,500 households.""" ;

Highways around Saskatoon, North Battleford, Melfort and Wynyard were closed as high winds and snow hit hard throughout much of the central part of the province.
Two people died after their car got stuck in the storm near Onion Lake First Nation. The 17-year-old boy and 38-year-old woman tried to walk to safety and died overnight Tuesday.
Environment Canada meteorologist Bob Cormier said the province was being split in half by the weather system.
Areas above a line running from Lloydminster to Saskatoon to south of Hudson Bay were being slammed by as much as 20 centimetres of snow and blizzard conditions. Saskatoon was one of the worst affected areas.
Driving 'could be suicide,' says trucker
Truck driver Peter Spock was among those who had to put their plans on hold. Spock was planning to haul a load to Burnaby, B.C., on Wednesday but decided to wait out the storm at a Husky gas station in Saskatoon.
Driving through the storm wasn't worth the risk, Spock said.
"It could be suicide. Me and the truck could be in the ditch and the load and everything," he said.
Brenda Hrabia, who works at a Super Stop near North Battleford, said even the truckers had pulled off the icy roads.
"The back is full of truckers. It is a total whiteout. The winds are really bad here," she said early in the day.
"I've never seen a storm like this in years. It's terrible."
Police respond only to emergencies
Saskatoon police were advising motorists to travel as little as possible. Police said that while the blizzard continued, they would be responding to emergency calls only.

They reported they were extremely busy. Car were abandoned in snowdrifts and ditches around the city.
The fire department asked people in the city not to use cellphones unless necessary to allow emergency services to get their messages through.
Public schools cancelled classes and asked parents to pick up their children. Some post-secondary institutions were closed.
The Saskatoon airport closed and the city's bus department said it would shut down at 6 p.m. The Saskatchewan Transportation Co. said no buses were running out of either Saskatoon or Prince Albert.
Taxis were running and city tow trucks said they were operating, although not on highways.
Prince Albert also hit hard
The wicked weather also hit Prince Albert in full force.
Blizzard conditions forced at least one local airline to cancel all flights in and out of the city and Prince Albert's First Nations University campus shut down for the day.
People in the southern portion of the province weren't seeing as much snow, but were also experiencing strong winds, blowing snow and low visibility.
There was some good news for Saskatchewan residents, however.
About 360 striking snowplow operators agreed to return to work Tuesday as the blizzard headed east. The union said it was concerned about the ability of managers to keep up with the road clearing that would be necessary.""" ;

In court in Meadow Lake, Sask., the accused pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of first-degree murder, as well as to seven counts of attempted murder.
He was originally charged with four counts of first-degree murder, but the Crown applied to have two of the counts reduced to second degree.
The Crown also confirmed in court Friday its application to have the accused, who was 17 at the time, be sentenced as an adult if convicted. The defence has opposed it, lawyer Aaron Fox saying there are a number of factors that come into play, including moral culpability and the teen's background.
The accused, who can't be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was charged in relation to two shootings in La Loche on Jan. 22.
On that day, two teenage brothers were shot and killed at a house in the Dene community of about 3,000 people. Shortly after, two teachers were killed by gunshot wounds and seven others were injured at the La Loche Community School.
The four deceased were:
Marie Janvier, 21, a teacher's assistant.
Adam Wood, 35, a teacher.
Brothers Dayne and Drayden Fontaine, 17 and 13, respectively.
Seven others were sent to hospital in Saskatoon for treatment.
Hearing to be held in La Loche
The hearing to determine whether or not the teen will be sentenced as an adult if convicted will be held in La Loche.
"It's important for cases like this, that are very serious, that the matters be dealt with in the community where the incidents arise," the judge told court. "It's important that the community be able to be there and see the justice process unfolding for them."
Crown prosecutor Lloyd Stang agreed.
As is allowed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, psychological and psychiatric reports will be prepared for the hearing, which has been scheduled for May and June 2017.""" ;

Hours later, police announced that young woman, Reese Fallon, had died, along with a 10-year-old girl. By the time the shooting stopped, 13 more victims, ranging in age from 17 to 59, had suffered gunshot wounds. Several of those people remain in hospital Monday night after undergoing life-saving surgery.
The gunman is also dead. Faisal Hussain, a 29-year-old Toronto resident suffered from severe mental health issues, according to his family. Ontario's police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), is still trying to figure out whether he was killed in a gunfight with police, or by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Falagario, a long-time resident of the area, said she heard a number of gunshots — police said the shooting started around 10 p.m. ET — then people running. Her husband raced from their home to a nearby ice cream parlour, and she followed.
Soon, they were both holding Fallon, who had been shot.
"I was just talking to her… to this beautiful girl," Falagario told CBC Toronto.
"I just talked to her, let her know she's not alone. She's not alone."
Linda Falagario, left, was shaken by the shooting, especially because she has a young daughter of her own, right. (CBC)
Wiping away tears beside her own young daughter, Falagario said she hopes Fallon's family knows their daughter was loved and cared for in her final moments.
Fallon had graduated from Malvern Collegiate Institute in Toronto just last month, and was set to attend McMaster University in Hamilton in the fall. She was also well known in the community for her work with the young Liberals group.
The shooting also claimed the life of 10-year-old Julianna Kozis of Markham.
Another man, Md Ashaduzamman, was trying to keep a girl of about the same age alive at a nearby cafe.
The shooting happened on the Danforth, a popular strip of restaurants and bars close to Toronto's downtown. Many witnesses described the crack of gunshots ringing out in the night, and then running for their lives when they realized what was happening.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said police don't know what prompted the attack, however this summer has seen a spate of gun violence in the city. Just days before the mass shooting, police had deployed hundreds more officers onto the streets during the evening hours.
"There is no magic pill that we're going to take to say all is well," Saunders told reporters at police headquarters.
"It's not going to happen overnight."
Saunders said officers made it to the scene in minutes. In the coming days, police will maintain a heightened presence on the Danforth, he said.
​Earlier, Saunders urged the public to share any information they have about the shooting, including video of what happened. He said the investigation is still in its early stages.
"I'm looking at every single possible motive for this," he said. "When you have this many people struck by gunfire it's a grave concern."
Firearm found after gunfight
The SIU, which investigates all cases of death and serious injury involving police in Ontario, is also probing the situation.
"How the man sustained his injury and what transpired are part of the SIU's investigation," said SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon.
Police say the motive for the attack is unknown. 'I'm looking at every single possible motive for this,' said Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders. (Paul Smith/CBC)
According to the SIU, Hussain walked along Danforth Avenue firing at various groups of people several times with a handgun, which has since been recovered.
The SIU said police officers located him on Bowden Street, near Danforth and Broadview avenues, and an exchange of gunfire took place. Hussain then fled, and was found dead on Danforth Avenue a short time later.
The SIU's investigation will focus solely on what occurred on Bowden Street, while the Toronto police will investigate what happened on Danforth Avenue, Hudon said.
Police have not said how Hussain died but said no officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire.
'Unspeakable act'
Mayor John Tory extended condolences to the families of the victims and thanked first responders for rushing to the scene to treat the injured. He said the shooting was an "unspeakable act," and called it an attack on the city.
"Our entire city has been shocked by this cowardly act of violence. As I said earlier this morning at the scene, I'm, of course, angry as we all are that someone would carry out such an attack, which really amounts to an attack on our city itself," Tory told city council.

"The gun violence in any part of our city is horrible and completely unacceptable."
Tory acknowledged that Toronto has a gun problem. He said he plans to reach out to provincial and federal officials to discuss public safety and the legality of guns. He said the city will be relentless to find out why the shooting occurred.
"In times of such horror, it is good to know that Toronto is not alone and Toronto will never be alone, and most important of all, that the people of Toronto will never be alone," he said.

On Sunday, Tory asked anyone with information — including video surveillance footage, dashcam video or cellphone recordings — to contact police.
Toronto Coun. Mary Fragedakis, whose ward includes Danforth Avenue, told council in tears that the victims and loved ones are in her thoughts and prayers.
"This is so heartbreaking," she said.

Violent thunderstorms and suspected tornadoes swept across southern Ontario on Thursday — killing at least one person, downing power lines and trees and ripping off roofs in several communities.
The death occurred in the town of Durham, police confirmed without giving details. A tornado reportedly touched down in the community, about 50 kilometres south of Owen Sound near Lake Huron and 180 km northwest of Toronto.
Multiple tornado sightings were reported across the province, including this one in Collingwood, Ont. ((Submitted by Cathy Butler))
Environment Canada meteorologist Geoff Coulson said at least three buildings in Durham suffered damage when the storm hit around 4 p.m. ET. Without confirming a tornado, the agency warned of potential twisters occurring through Thursday evening.
In the wake of eastbound storms that swept through the Greater Toronto Area, the City of Vaughan declared a state of emergency. The city just north of Toronto opened shelters for residents displaced from their homes.
About 120 seriously damaged homes in Vaughan had to be evacuated, said York Region Fire Chief Greg Senay.
The powerful storms overturned vehicles, lifted roofs off homes and pulled air conditioners out of windows.
The storm gradually lost some power as it crossed the eastern part of Ontario. Late Thursday night, the last tornado watches for the Kingston area were dropped by Environment Canada.
Severe thunderstorm warnings remained up for an area stretching from Pembroke to Ottawa and Brockville.
An estimated 69,000 Hydro One customers were reported to be without power in the wake of the storms, while Toronto Hydro said an unknown number of its customers were without power due to multiple outages.
Flights affected
The severe weather caused dozens of delays and cancellations at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.
"It's the same as any time we have a storm. It takes some time to come back to normal," Greater Toronto Airports Authority spokeswoman Trish Krale told CBC News, without elaborating on how many flights were affected.
Pearson has a policy requiring ground crews to be pulled from outside work when lightning strikes are recorded in the vicinity of the airport, she noted. "There was quite some time the ground crews were inside," Krale said.
Barn thrown
"It was a full-blown tornado, without any doubt," Durham-area resident Philly Markowitz said.
A barn on her property was picked up and thrown into her home, she told CBC News.
"The house directly across the road from me is missing a roof," she said. "The house next door to me — the barn is missing. We can't find the barn."
The town of Durham, Ont., about 60 kilometres south of Owen Sound, was reportedly hit by a tornado on Thursday afternoon. ((CBC))
Coulson said an unconfirmed tornado sighting was also reported in Craigleith, near Collingwood.
Possible twisters
A tornado reportedly hit near Vaughan Mills Shopping Centre, just north of Toronto, as a thunderstorm moved in a northeasterly direction, according to Environment Canada.
York Region police dispatched crews to the scene but didn't immediately confirm the presence of a tornado to CBC News.
The town of Milton, west of Toronto, also may have experienced a tornado.
"[It] looks like a tornado touched down here," resident Rod McLachlan said. "The roof is off a [former] church and a whole street is littered with branches broken off of trees."
Commuter Jane Taguicana told CBC News she was on a GO Train going toward Milton at around 7 p.m. ET when the train stopped for more than an hour. Passengers were told the train was delayed by fallen trees on the tracks, as well as signal problems.
The Toronto Transit Commission said a northern section of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway service was shut down from Downsview station to Wilson station. Shuttle buses were in service, the TTC said.
'The barn is missing. We can't find the barn.' —Philly Markowitz, who lives near Durham, Ont.
The town of Markdale, east of Durham, was also reportedly struck by a tornado.
"[They were] the highest winds I've ever seen in my life going by," Mark Worthington of True Value hardware in Markdale told CBC News.
"Trees were ripped down, 60-foot trees have been pulled out of the ground, we lost about a quarter of our roof and we have a barn outside and half of the roof is off of it as well."
Markdale's deputy mayor, David Fawcett, said the community's cemetery "has been hit really, really hard."
He estimated that 40 to 50 trees had been knocked down by the storm. Tombstones were also toppled, likely by the falling trees, he said.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement, saying: "Our thoughts and prayers are with any who have [seen] loss of life or been dislocated because of this and obviously the Government of Canada, where appropriate, will work with local and provincial authorities to deal with the situation.\"""" ;

Ontario's police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), released Hussain's identity on Monday evening, hours after investigators say the 29-year-old Toronto resident opened fire on a number of Danforth Avenue restaurants in an attack that has left the city in shock.
Witnesses captured several chilling images and videos of the attack, which took place around 10 p.m. ET on Sunday and left a 10-year-old girl and 18-year-old Reese Fallon dead. More shooting victims remain in hospital, with some having undergone multiple life-saving surgeries, according to doctors.
Hussain died of a gunshot wound after exchanging fire with Toronto police. The SIU is looking into whether he was shot by police, or himself.
Family condemns 'horrific actions'
Hussain's family emailed a statement to CBC Toronto saying they are devastated by what happened and that their son was struggling with "severe mental health challenges," including psychosis and depression.
"We are at a terrible loss for words but we must speak out to express our deepest condolences to the families who are now suffering on account of our son's horrific actions," the family's statement said.
"While we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end."
Earlier Monday, police searched Hussain's residence in the city's Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood, but have yet to release a potential motive for the shooting.
On Tuesday, the federal public safety minister's office said local police will continue to lead the investigation into Hussain's background.
"There is no national security nexus at this time," communications officer Hilary Peirce said in an email to CBC.
Several friends and neighbours who spoke with CBC News described Hussain as quiet and shy, and some were aware of his mental health problems.
Aamir Sukhera ran a public-speaking club, Toastmasters, that Hussain attended. He said Hussain told him he had psychosis and depression and was seeing a psychiatrist.

"I thought [Toastmasters] would be a good idea for him — it might help him open up and speak," he said. "And through the process, I discovered he had some sort of mental illness and that he was seeking help for it."
Sukhera said Hussain was polite, humble and reserved and that he wasn't violent.
During the attack, the gunman, dressed all in black with a black baseball cap covering part of his face, calmly walked down the Danforth Avenue sidewalk before turning and firing a black handgun into a restaurant.
Another image, captured by a store owner's surveillance system, appears to show him walking with the gun hanging by his side.

Other witnesses said he zig-zagged across the popular street — the heart of Toronto's Greektown — just to pick off targets.
Hussain died shortly after exchanging gunfire with Toronto police officers on Bowden Street, not far from the strip of restaurants where the attacks took place.
At an afternoon news conference, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said the motive for the attack is still unclear, and he urged the public to provide any information they can about the incident.
Saunders said no officers were injured during the firefight.
The SIU investigates all cases of death or serious injury involving police.
The SIU says a post-mortem will be conducted on Hussain on Tuesday.
Here is the entire statement from Hussain's family:
"We are at a terrible loss for words but we must speak out to express our deepest condolences to the families who are now suffering on account of our son's horrific actions.
"We are utterly devastated by the incomprehensible news that our son was responsible for the senseless violence and loss of life that took place on the Danforth.
"Our son had severe mental health challenges, struggling with psychosis and depression his entire life. The interventions of professionals were unsuccessful. Medications and therapy were unable to treat him. While we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end.
"Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy. We will mourn those who were lost for the rest of our lives.\"""" ;

<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ap-lax-shooter-opened-fire-while-officers-on-break/> dct:description """LOS ANGELES, Calif. - Minutes before a gunman opened fire in a Los Angeles International Airport terminal last fall, killing a security screener and wounding three other people, the two armed officers assigned to the area left for breaks without informing a dispatcher as required.
The Los Angeles Airport Police Department officers were outside Terminal 3 when
uthorities say Paul Ciancia opened fire with an assault rifle in an attack targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, two law enforcement officials said. The officials requested anonymity, saying they were briefed on the shooting but were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.
As terrified travelers dived for cover, TSA officers — who are unarmed — fled the screening area without hitting a panic button or using a landline to call for help. It took a call from an airline contractor to a police dispatcher, who then alerted officers over the radio — a lag of nearly a minute and a half, the officials said.
Before officers could get to the scene, Ciancia fatally wounded TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez and then headed to the screening area where he shot two more agents and a traveler, authorities said. Ciancia was eventually subdued after being wounded by officers in the gate area of the terminal.
Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox
When the shooting started, the two officials say one of the armed officers assigned to the terminal was at or just outside an adjacent terminal. One of the officials said the officer was on a bathroom break and the other foot-beat officer was in a vehicle on the tarmac outside Terminal 3, headed for a meal break.
The new details about the whereabouts of the two officers come as authorities review the overall response, including whether emergency medical personnel were forced to wait longer than necessary to remove Hernandez so he could be taken to a hospital. Hernandez did not receive medical care until 33 minutes after he was shot. A coroner's release said he was likely dead within two to five minutes.
Departmental procedures require that officers notify a dispatcher before going on break and leaving their patrol area in order to ensure supervisors are aware of their absence and, if necessary, a relief unit can be brought in to cover their area.
Airport police union chief Marshall McClain said the two officers assigned to Terminal 3 still were in position to quickly respond to the shooting. He said he'd spoken with both and confirmed one was "going to the restroom or coming back from the restroom" and the other was headed out on a meal break but still within his patrol area.
"He hadn't gone on break yet. He was going to go on break," McClain said. What typically happens is, "if you're going to go on a lunch break, you get to your location and you tell them that you're there." Officers often do this in order to maximize their lunch break so they don't lose time while traveling.
Within a minute of the dispatcher's call, that officer had stopped someone who ran out of the terminal and the other officer was heading toward the shooting, McClain said.
Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview that he's watched surveillance video and received briefings on the investigation. While officers were able to take Ciancia into custody within five minutes of the shooting, he said, "It could have been a lot worse."
Whatever the investigation's conclusions, Garcetti said, "I want to make sure that in any terminal, there's always somebody there, that a bathroom break doesn't result in somebody, even for a few minutes, being out of the action."
According to investigators, Ciancia, originally from Pennsville, N.J., arrived at the airport on Nov. 1 with the intention of killing TSA workers. Authorities have said Ciancia had a grudge against the agency, but they have not indicated what prompted it.
After entering the terminal, police say Ciancia pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and began spraying the area with gunfire. Hernandez was mortally wounded and became the first TSA agent to die in the line of duty.
The dispatcher's alert over police radio brought an officer on a Segway, another on a bike, one on a motorcycle, two in a patrol car and one on foot, said one of the law enforcement officials. Two of the first responding officers shot Ciancia, who survived and now faces murder and other charges.
Airport Police Chief Pat Gannon lauded his officers for what he called a swift and brave response to a gunman. He said he was "comfortable with what the officers were doing at the time that the shooting occurred and their ability to respond to the incident."
"It's not about who was or was not there and how that all occurred," Gannon said. "Those officers responsible for that terminal were there as quick as anybody else was to deal with those particular issues. They were not goofing off."
Airports are allowed to make their own security plans for armed officers, as long as they follow basic guidelines and get their plans approved by the TSA. An updated policy at LAX was outlined last April in an internal memo that was verified by one of the officials.
Officers assigned to the terminals must inform supervisors when they want to take a break. "Absent exigent circumstances, (the units) shall not leave the assigned terminal area without prior authorization and a relief unit," the memo stated.
In an important change, officers no longer were required to remain at a podium by the screening area. In an effort to make security plans less predictable, they are allowed to roam the terminal provided they can respond to an emergency at the screening station within three minutes.
TSA Officer Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union, said removing the officers from the podiums at the screening stations has been unnerving for screeners.
"They're not there, and you're saying to yourself, 'Oh, hopefully nothing happens right now,'" Payes said.
TSA Administrator John Pistole testified before lawmakers two weeks after the shooting and said his agency was conducting its own review. As part of it, they are looking at "how do we ramp up the unpredictable random patrols by armed officers — at and through checkpoints — that may now be doing other things."
He said the agency was also examining, as part of its review, whether there should be a radio system that puts security screeners and airport police on the same channel.
Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent who was chief of homeland security and intelligence at LAX from 2007 to 2010, said the combination of the officers being away and the policy change gave Ciancia the soft target he wanted. Had officers still been stationed at the screening area, "that arguably would have put them in a position to know about the incident and respond to it in a much more reduced time span," he said.""" ;

Security forces denied the kidnappings. Nigeria's government and military have been widely criticized for their slow response to the abductions of more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped April 15.
There was no way to safely and independently confirm the report from Kummabza, 95 miles from Maiduguri, capital of Borno state and headquarters of a military state of emergency that has failed to curtail near-daily attacks by Boko Haram fighters.
Aji Khalil, of a local anti-Boko Haram group, said Tuesday the abductions took place Saturday in an attack in which four villagers were killed.

CBS News contributor Debora Patta said two sources in Nigeria who have contact with Boko Haram both told her on Tuesday that the reports of another mass kidnapping were accurate, according to people they had spoken to in Kummabza. Both sources -- one who is involved in the government's unofficial negotiations with Boko Haram and the other a lawyer with ties to the group -- said the Islamic militants were likely responsible for the kidnapping, but noted that there had been no claim of responsibility.
Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained members in exchange for its hostages.
Both the source involved in the negotiations, and a separate security official told Patta on Tuesday, independently, that they believe Boko Haram likely kidnapped another large group of civilians in an effort to strong-arm President Goodluck Jonathan to the negotiating table to expedite the release of the group's jailed members.""" ;

<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trial-set-to-begins-for-minnesota-man-who-shot-teens-in-his-home/> dct:description """LITTLE FALLS, Minn. - Attorneys will begin selecting jurors today to decide whether a central Minnesota man acted reasonably in November 2012 when he repeatedly shot and killed two teens or whether his actions amounted to a cold-blooded, calculated execution.
After 65-year-old Byron Smith shot a teen, 17-year-old Nick Brady, who had entered his home, authorities say he dragged the boy's bloodied body into a basement workshop, sat down - and waited.
When another teen, 18-year-old Haile Kifer, began descending the stairway minutes later, Smith fired again. The girl tumbled down the stairs and he shot her some more, including what he allegedly called "a good, clean finishing shot" into her head as she gasped for air, according to a criminal complaint.
It was Thanksgiving Day, 2012, and Smith left the teens' bodies in his basement overnight before asking a neighbor to call police, the complaint said.
Smith, of Little Falls, claims he was defending himself. Though the teens were unarmed, he told police he'd been burglarized before and feared they had a weapon. He faces two counts of premeditated, first-degree murder in a case that rocked this quiet city of about 8,000 and stirred debate about just how far a person can go to protect one's home from a potential threat.
The trial is expected to stir up emotion in this rural area that straddles the Mississippi River about 100 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Many residents who spoke to The Associated Press said that the teens were wrong to enter Smith's home - but that he went too far. Still, some believe Smith was justified. Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel's office received several calls in the days after the killings, some of them critical of the charges.
"There will always be those people that think that he did nothing wrong, regardless of the facts," Wetzel told the AP last week. "But once all the facts are known, I think the number of people who think he did nothing wrong is going to be reduced dramatically."
Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but authorities have said Smith crossed a line when he continued to shoot the teens after they were no longer a threat.
Smith's attorney, Steve Meshbesher, said the evidence will show his client is innocent of the accusations against him. Prosecutor Pete Orput said he is looking forward to letting jurors decide whether Smith's actions were premeditated.
Messages left with family members of the victims were not returned.

According the complaint, Smith told authorities he was in his basement that Thanksgiving Day when he heard a window break upstairs and heard footsteps in his house. He saw Brady coming down the basement stairwell, then shot him. Brady fell. And as Brady was looking up at Smith, Smith shot him the face, the complaint said.
The complaint said Smith told an investigator: "I want him dead."
Smith said he dragged Brady's body into his workshop, then sat in a chair. When Kifer came down the stairs, he shot her too. After she fell, he tried to shoot her again but his gun jammed, and she laughed, the complaint said. Smith pulled out another gun and shot her several times in the chest, acknowledging he fired "more shots than I needed to," the complaint said.
He allegedly dragged her into the room with Brady. Kifer was still gasping for air, so he fired what he called a "good, clean finishing shot" under her chin "up into the cranium," the complaint said.
Smith is a retired security engineer for the U.S. Department of State. His job would have focused on technical security issues for U.S. embassies, such as building layout and alarms.
Meshbesher, Smith's attorney, has said Smith's home had been broken into a half-dozen times in the months before the shootings, and he installed a security system to protect himself.
Evidence expected to be presented at trial includes video surveillance of the teens entering Smith's home, as well as an audio recording of the killings. Prosecutors have said the audio tape shows four shots were fired at Brady, and that Kifer can be heard 10 minutes later saying, "Nick?" before more shots were fired. Prosecutors have said Smith can be heard telling Kifer: "You're dying."
Assistant Morrison County Attorney Todd Kosovich has said the killings were an "ambush" and that Smith removed light bulbs from sockets and sat by a tall bookcase so the teens couldn't see him as they came downstairs.
Kifer and Brady were cousins and were well-known in the community. Both were involved in sports, and Kifer worked several part-time jobs, according to online obituaries.
But a different picture of the teens emerged after their deaths. Authorities have said a car linked to Brady and Kifer contained prescription drugs that had been stolen from another house, apparently the day before they were killed. And court documents from another case show Brady had burglarized Smith's property at least twice in the months before he was shot.
Some residents said they were anxious for the trial to start and that it will bring some answers.
"So many things just don't make sense," said Bernie Jeub, 69, of Royalton, a community near Little Falls. "There's no doubt about it - the kids shouldn't have been there. But did he have to do what he did?"
Kathy Carlson, 57, of Little Falls, said the killings made her angry.
"He should go down," she said of Smith. "They didn't have the right to go stealing, but he didn't have the right to kill them."
If convicted of first-degree murder, Smith faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release.""" ;

<http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-gage-park-killings-family-dog-survived-20160205-story.html> dct:description """After hearing her six neighbors were likely slain in their Gage Park neighborhood home, Markita Williams thought their dog was probably dead as well.
But when an officer came out with a visibly shaking Pelusa in his arms, Williams said she felt a great sense of relief.
"Pelusa always barked and made noise so I just assumed she hadn't made it," Williams said.
Earlier this week, Williams had knocked on the victims' front door to ask them to move a truck, but there was no response and no noise from the family dog.
Then, after the killings, "The police asked me to keep the dog so she would not be in the way of their investigation," Williams said. "She was whimpering and a bloody mess."
Williams took in Pelusa, who her family has known for about three years since they moved next door to the victims, she said. Pelusa, a Spanish word meaning fuzz or fuzzy, was familiar with Williams and her family. But that seemed to give little comfort to the dog.
"She had blood on her mouth and we tried to give her a bath, but she took off," Williams said.
Instead, Williams' daughter wiped her down with a washcloth. Pelusa "was fighting. She wasn't having it."

Bathing wasn't the only thing that proved difficult. Pelusa refused to eat the dog food Williams bought.
"We put the dog food in a bowl and she wouldn't touch it," Williams said. "I decided to feed her by hand, but she wasn't having it."
Thursday night, Williams said the dog continued to cry and shake.
"I just wish I knew what she was thinking when everything happened in her house," she said. "I can't imagine what she saw or how she is feeling, I just know she is petrified."
When Williams let the dog out Friday when Williams went out herself to see the news crews, Pelusa's reaction confirmed she was very afraid.
"She was shaking so bad,"Williams said.
At some point, Pelusa was taken to the backyard to relieve herself.
"She started to walk over toward her house and my daughter carried her back," Williams said. "Then Pelusa just stared in that direction.
But Friday afternoon, Pelusa started to perk up when she smelled Williams preparing beef tacos in her kitchen.
"She followed me around in the kitchen so I gave her some of the beef once it was done," she said.
"She ate the ground beef so I put more in her bowl and she cleaned the bowl out," Williams joyfully said. "Now we know she eats table food."
Williams acknowledged her family aren't "dog people," but she is willing to give Pelusa shelter until things are figured out.
"I'm waiting for their family members to come and decide if they want to take her," Williams said. "We are not sure if we will keep her if they refuse, but whatever happens I want her to have a loving home after everything she has witnessed. I can't imagine what she saw, but I'm glad she was spared.\"""" ;

<http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-gage-park-slayings-20160205-story.html> dct:description """The Cook County medical examiner's office determined Friday that the deaths of all six people inside a Gage Park home were homicides, five of them from "sharp force" or "blunt force" injuries and the sixth from gunshot wounds.
The six family members were found dead a little after 1 p.m. Thursday when police were called to a home in the 5700 block of South California Avenue because a man who lived there had not shown up for work.
The medical examiner's office did not release their identities officially, saying in a release that "in all homicides, official identification must be done visually by next-of-kin or by scientific means, for example using fingerprint matches."
But relatives have identified them as Rosaura Hernandez and Noe Martinez, in their 60s; their son Noe Martinez Jr., in his 40s; Maria Herminia Martinez, in her 30s; and her two sons, Alexis and Leonardo, 10 and 13.
The older man and the children died from "multiple sharp-force injuries," according to the medical examiner's office. The older woman died from "multiple sharp- and blunt-force injuries," while the younger man died from "multiple blunt- and multiple sharp-force injuries," according to the office. The woman in her 30s died from "multiple gunshot wounds."
Police had said Thursday that they could not rule out the possibility that one of those found dead may have committed suicide, but the medical examiner's office ruled all of the deaths homicides.
Earlier in the day, Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy said at a news conference that there was no sign of gunfire in the home. Roy said the doors were locked, there was no sign of forced entry and the home was not ransacked.
He said the six were killed between late Tuesday afternoon and Thursday morning. Asked about a motive, Roy said it was too early in the investigation to say. He would also not comment on whether police had any suspects in mind.
"This is a complex investigation," he said. "We're working meticulously, which means we take our time. ... We take our time, but with a sense of urgency, making sure we didn't miss anything."
Police are not ruling out any possible scenario at this point, Roy added.
"Everything from a domestic incident, possible robbery or even possibly something nefarious that could have targeted the family is being explored," said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi in an email.
Their bodies were found around 1 p.m. after police were asked by a co-worker of one of the residents to check on him because he had not shown up the last few days. Police were told it was "out of character" for him.

One of the responding officers radioed in: "Roll ambulance this way. We got people passed out. Don't know if they're dead or what. We'll make a forced entry too."
"About how many people you got down?" a dispatcher asks.
"So far we see just one down, but the neighbors say that there's six people living there," the officer says, then adds, "Send a sarge over here, it's a bloody mess."
The officer said a resident near the back door appeared to have been "stabbed multiple times." He had not yet checked the other bodies.
The family of the victims has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to cover funeral expenses.
"This has shocked and left their family, relatives and loved ones speechless and heartbroken as the household was nothing but a loving and gentle family that was always quiet," the family says on the website. "In the time of need the family asks for help in both prayers and donations to help send the bodies back to Mexico, where they would've wished to be buried.
"The donations given will help send the bodies to Mexico and help with the funerals and burying ceremonies of all six members," it adds. "God bless everyone, every little bit helps and is appreciated greatly."
The victims were not removed from the home until about 10 hours after they were discovered as forensics investigators worked the crime scene.
Erik Serrano, 23, stood alone in front of the home around midnight as white trucks pulled up in the alley and workers carried out the victims. His girlfriend lives across the street.
"It's just sad," Serrano said. "How can someone kill a child? They're heartless. ... They need God. They need church."
It was the silence that Serrano most noticed. "It's so quiet. It's weird. You always hear cars here because California is a major road."
After midnight, Serrano walked away. By 4 a.m., police opened up California Avenue to traffic, leaving a section of red tape wrapped in front of the house.
Hugo Lopez, who lives next door to the victims, also called the slayings "heartless" and said he was shocked this happened in his quiet neighborhood.
"It's really sad," he said.""" ;

<http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/06/omaha.shooting/#cnnSTCText> dct:description """LINCOLN, Nebraska (CNN) -- The troubled teen who killed eight people and himself at an Omaha, Nebraska, mall was placed in a mental health treatment center five years ago after making homicidal threats toward his stepmother, a state official said Thursday.
Todd Landry, director of the Nebraska Division of Family and Children's Services, described for reporters the laundry list of residential treatment centers and group and foster homes where Robert Hawkins spent much of his teen years, because of his behavioral and psychiatric problems.
At one point during that period Hawkins also filed a report with police alleging he was molested by a roommate at one of the facilities. The case was resolved internally, according to the report.
Asked about the allegation, Landry responded, "I can't confirm or deny that that may have happened."
Hawkins was sent to Piney Ridge Center in Waynesville, Missouri, on May 18, 2002 -- a day after his 14th birthday. The center specializes in mental health and substance abuse services, according to its Web site.
Landry, reading from a juvenile court petition filed by Sarpy County, Nebraska, said Hawkins was placed at the center because of "homicidal threats to his stepmother."
"He also had two psychiatric hospitalizations, and has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, mood disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and parent-child relationship problems," Landry said.
He offered no details about the problems with the stepmother.
When the teen went to live with friends of the family one and a half years ago, "issues with the stepmother" were the reason, said Debora Maruca-Kovac, into whose house he moved. Watch her describe their last conversation »
Landry divulged only information from public records, as allowed by law.
Hawkins was a ward of the state from September 17, 2002, through August 24, 2006. Parental rights were never severed, authorities said.
Among the problems cited in the records were his involvement in a fight and substance abuse problems.
Nebraska court records show a Hawkins with a matching age had a juvenile criminal history including charges of alcohol and drug use, disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He is listed in the records as living with a foster parent.
According to Landry, Hawkins' treatments were extensive, and cost the state $265,000 while he was in its custody.
"This tragedy was not a failure of the system to provide appropriate quality services for a youth that needed it," he said.
Maruca-Kovac described Hawkins on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Wednesday night as "kind of like a pound puppy that nobody wanted."
Paraphrasing a suicide note he left in their home, she said, "He didn't want to be a burden to people and [said] that he was a piece of s--- all of his life and that now he'd be famous." Watch officials detail the rampage »
Hawkins' body was found on the third floor of the Von Maur store inside Westroads Mall. Police believe the attacks were premeditated, but the victims were targeted at random.
Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Hawkins visited with a friend before going to the mall, and he sent a text message to a girl, apparently a recent ex-girlfriend. He also left voicemail for his mother, Warren said.
Maruca-Kovac told CNN Hawkins left the house Wednesday about 11 a.m., and called her about two hours later, sounding upset.
"He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry," Maruca-Kovac said. He told her he had been fired that day from his job at McDonald's, she said. See a map of where the shooting took place »
"I said, 'Come home and we'll talk about it.' "
"He said, 'It's too late.' He said he'd left a note explaining everything."
The suicide note left at Maruca-Kovac's home was turned over to police, who wouldn't divulge its contents.
"He basically said how sorry he was for everything," Maruca-Kovac told CNN on Wednesday night. She described Hawkins as well-behaved, although "he had a lot of emotional problems, obviously."
This past summer, Hawkins tried to enlist in the U.S. Army but was turned down, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. The source didn't want his name used because revealing information about potential recruits is against military rules.
The two recruiters who spoke with Hawkins said he appeared to be a typical teenager.
"He said he'd had a rough time in his life and wanted to see about changing it," Army Sgt. Edward Dust said.
Hawkins had been on antidepressants but stopped taking them because they made him feel "weird," Maruca-Kovac said. There was no public information on how long he had been off the medication or what the medication was.
When Hawkins moved in with Maruca-Kovac's family, Maruca-Kovac said, he felt mistreated and rejected by everyone. He also suffered from depression.
"When he first came and lived with us, he was in the fetal position and chewed his fingernails all the time, and was unemployed, and hopeless. After awhile, he got a job and came out of that," Maruca-Kovac told CNN. He also got a haircut, and seemed happier, she said.
She said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather. Although police haven't completed tracing the weapon Warren said police believe Hawkins stole the firearm, which was stored at his stepfather's residence. Warren said it was an "AK-47 assault weapon."
Maruca-Kovac said her family is "devastated" by what happened.
A friend, Shawn Saunders, told CNN, "It's still hard to imagine the guy that I knew, that I used to hang out with, was capable of something like this." Watch how Saunders learned Hawkins was the shooter »
He added, "I'm not sure the level of depression, I just know he was on antidepressants the last couple of months. I guess it was just getting worse over time with the loss of his job and I guess issues he had going on with the girlfriend at the time." E-mail to a friend

<http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/weather/12/04/northwest.storms/index.html> dct:description """(CNN) -- A pair of storms that slammed into the Pacific Northwest had much of the region under water Tuesday, leaving five people dead, thousands without power and major highways shut down.
The governors of Oregon and Washington have declared states of emergency, hoping to speed relief efforts after storms that pushed up water levels in some areas 25 feet in less than 48 hours.
"My priority is to ensure the safety of Oregonians by providing whatever resources they need to stay warm and dry and protect their property," said Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski.
The floodwaters came frighteningly close to some motorists.
One recalled driving in reverse for half a mile Monday evening after realizing his commute home might end badly.
"You don't realize how quickly you can become a victim. It scared the living crap out of me," Ed Crowdis told The Associated Press.

"They're moving down the streets, and through the backyards," Maj. Mike Braibish, spokesman for the National Guard, told the AP.

There were also forced evacuations in many places, including the Seattle area. Monday was the second-wettest day in the city's history, officials told CNN affiliate KING-TV. Floodwaters also made a mess of homes and stores in suburban Seattle.
"It's done; we're out of business," wine shop owner Steve Body told KING. "We just grabbed everything and took it to higher ground." Check out a map of the flooding »
Despite the dangerous conditions, people in some areas were reluctant to leave, but many were finally persuaded to flee. Firefighters in Centralia, Washington, made the situation clear to Katrina Puris and her family, the AP reported.
"They were yelling: 'If you're not coming out now, we're leaving,' " Puris said. "So I just grabbed everything I could and we just ran."
Her three young children were calm as a truck took the family to higher ground, but Puris was terrified, she told the AP.
"They were pretty good. They were all quiet," she said. "I was scared. I was bawling."
U.S. Coast Guard and Navy helicopters have been plucking people from danger zones, sometimes from rooftops, according to KING-TV.
"If there's anyone out there right now ... if they need assistance, we'll try our best to come to their rescue," said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Tara Molle.
The storm that hit the region Monday brought hurricane-force winds only a day after another severe storm system had moved through. Watch howling winds lash Washington »
"It's a double whammy we're getting here -- first we had a huge windstorm that went on for more than 12 hours," said Grays Harbor County, Washington, Sheriff Michael Whelan. "We have, literally, across the county, thousands of trees down." See photos of the flooding »
Whelan said 80 percent of his county, on the coast in western Washington, remained without power Tuesday afternoon.
In Centralia, about 8 feet of floodwater shut down Interstate 5, which runs between Seattle and Portland, Oregon.
It may reopen Thursday, pending a damage assessment, the AP reported.
"We've got to be able to see if we have structural integrity in the highway," said David Dye, deputy secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation, according to the AP. "We've got lots of debris, garbage, tires, dead rats everywhere."
About 54,000 vehicles usually use the highway daily, according to Paula Hammond, secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation. She and Gov. Chris Gregoire said it's too soon to know how much damage had been done to I-5 and other roads in the region, but it is expected to be major.
"We've already had a call from the Federal Highway Administration asking what they could do and our message was clear -- bring out your checkbook," Gregoire said. "We cannot tell you the damages right now but they are obviously going to be significant."
On Monday, Washington's National Guard took part in about 150 search-and-rescue missions. By 4 p.m., 75 people had been rescued, according to Gregoire, and operations continued until about 10 p.m.
In Oregon, more than 550 people were in Red Cross shelters Monday night.
By Tuesday afternoon, the rain in Oregon and Washington had mostly stopped and floodwater had started to recede. The storm system moved into the Upper Plains and Midwest, with parts of North Dakota likely to get up to 9 inches of snow. E-mail to a friend

iReporter Candy Novoa says she woke up Friday to find a tree branch lying across her neighbor's car.
The National Weather Service said sleet and snow, along with more than half an inch of ice that accumulated on roads in some areas, had made driving treacherous. In Massachusetts, work crews struggled to clear the debris because the powerful storm left roads and bridges covered in ice.
Gov. Deval Patrick told WCVB-TV in Boston it would be optimistic to think power would be restored by Monday.
"This is not going to be a couple of hours," Patrick said. "It's likely to be several days."
Patrick mobilized 500 National Guardsmen to help clear roads, WCVB-TV reported. Utility company National Grid reported that nearly 300,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts were without power.
Schools were closed across the state, as authorities warned ice-laden branches could snap and down power lines
"This is a serious storm," John Maserjian, a spokesman for Central Hudson Gas & Electric in upstate New York, told CNN. "We have contended with worse storms in past years, but this is among the worst."
In New Hampshire, more than 300,000 residents had no electricity, CNN affiliate WMUR in Manchester said, citing reports from four of the state's utility companies.
The station reported that fire departments across the state were scrambling to respond to reports of transformer explosions, downed power lines and utility poles, as well as burning and felled trees.
The New Hampshire state fire marshal's office told WMUR a 49-year-old man died during the ice storm. WMUR reported a 49-year-old man died from carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to heat his camper using a generator.
Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency and issued a statement, saying, "With rain expected to continue and temperatures expected to drop as the day progresses it is important that the state has all its resources available to manage this situation."
Amtrak train service between Albany, New York, and New York City was suspended Friday morning, as was service between Portland, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts. Ice and wind caused tree limbs to clutter the tracks and work crews could not clear them.
Amtrak said it hoped to have service restored by Friday evening rush hour.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning Friday morning, saying that increasing winds and significant amounts of snow and sleet were expected. The deteriorating conditions could result in further damage to trees and power lines, the weather service said.
Central Maine Power had 220,000 homes and businesses without electricity, spokesman John Carroll said Friday afternoon.
In upstate New York, two utility companies reported that more than 200,000 customers were without power
More than 50,000 Central Hudson Gas & Electric customers in the Hudson River Valley were without power early Friday afternoon, said Denise VanBuren, a spokeswoman for the utility.
Mutual aid crews in neighboring areas are spread thin, VanBuren said, so utility officials are requesting help from out-of-state crews, meaning power is not likely to be restored until Sunday or Monday.
National Grid in New York reported more than 185,000 customers lost power in 23 counties. The company also had 22,000 customers in New Hampshire and 6,000 in Rhode Island without power.
Residents also were having to contend with floods caused by excessive rainfall and blocked storm drains.
The power outages raised concerns about the health of senior citizens in Holden, Massachusetts, and Goffstown, New Hampshire.
Medical crews in Goffstown evacuated the Villager Nursing Home after the facility lost power. Residents were moved to a nearby middle school, WMUR reported.
In Holden, senior citizens requiring oxygen were transported to a local hospital or a makeshift shelter at the town's senior center, according to WCVB.
"Stay home if you live in Holden. Don't come to Holden if you work here," Holden Fire Chief Jack Chandler told WCVB.
Friday's weather service forecast called for continued snow showers and temperatures below freezing across the Northeast. Snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches were expected.

Authorities identified the shooter, seen in a yearbook photo, as Michael McLendon, 28, of Kinston, Alabama. more photos »
Authorities identified the shooter as Michael McLendon, 28, of Kinston, Alabama, in Coffee County. Speaking at several news conferences on Wednesday, authorities also released a detailed timeline of the rampage -- which lasted less than an hour -- and identified the victims.
Investigators late Wednesday said they were closer to finding a motive behind why McLendon would fatally shoot his mother in his hometown of Kinston before moving on to open fire in Samson and then Geneva.
"Evidence collected does indicate his reasons -- what the reason are I can't get into right now," said Lt. Barry Tucker of the Alabama Bureau of Investigations. "He was somewhat depressed about job issues, but the information we have does not specify [the motive] was job-related."
Coffee County District Attorney Gary McAliley told the newspaper in nearby Dothan that McLendon likely planned the rampage for a while. He said investigators have found dozens of ammunition boxes, military and survival gear and medical supplies at McLendon's Kinston home.
The Alabama Bureau of Investigation said authorities recovered a phone list and a notebook from the home, "but there is no evidence that indicates a hit list of any kind."
Tucker said the notebook contained, "a couple of pages of notes, people he worked with, places he worked -- it was over a year old." Asked whether the notes expressed grievances against others, Tucker said no.
The assault Tuesday ended at the Reliable Metal Products plant in Geneva, 24 miles from Kinston. Police said McLendon engaged in a shootout before killing himself inside the building.
McLendon shot and killed at least 10 people, including two children, and wounded at least four others, officials said.
McLendon, who had no known criminal record before carrying out the rampage, worked briefly as a police officer in Samson, but failed to complete the "required training" at the police academy in Montgomery in 2003, according to Alabama State Trooper Capt. Marc McHenry.
He "didn't last a week and a half" at the academy and received no firearms training there, Murphy said.
"We believe he fired in excess of 200 rounds during the assaults," Alabama State Police Cpl. Steve Jarrett said. See photos of the shooting scenes »

The rampage began Tuesday afternoon when McLendon shot and killed his mother before setting fire to the home he shared with her in Kinston, near the Alabama-Florida state line. He then headed to Samson, where he opened fire on his uncle's front porch as his uncle and other relatives stood outside with the neighbors from across the street. Mayor: "Shock and disbelief" »
Those neighbors happened to be the family of Geneva County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers, who was later involved in a shoot-out with the gunman, unaware that McLendon had shot and killed his wife and young daughter and critically injured his nearly 4-month-old baby, Ella Kay.
A family friend found the couple's 4-year-old son hiding in the Myers' home after the shooting.
Five people, including Myers' wife, Andrea, and their 1½-year-old daughter, Corinne Gracy, were killed on the porch. McLendon then opened fire on his grandmother, who was standing in the doorway of her home next door. Watch deputy ask for prayers for wounded daughter »
Alina Knowles was in her home in Samson when she heard the gunman fire on the porch so many times that it sounded like a horror film.
After the shooting stopped, Knowles saw the gunman flee the area and drive around the block. Watch the aftermath of the shooting spree »
Knowles, a certified nurse assistant, looked around for survivors. She saw members of Myers' family dead on the porch, but nobody's chest was moving to signal they were alive.
Then she heard Myers' baby girl, Ella Kay, crying.
"[I] picked her up, came between the two vehicles," she said. "Saw him coming up the road, ducked so he wouldn't see me, as he was coming up this way I ducked, was still ducking and moving around their van trying to keep him from seeing me with that baby."
Knowles said she knew if she wasn't careful, the gunman would target her.
"I would have been dead," she said. "I would have been on that ground there."
Knowles was able to get the deputy's child and herself to safety. But the horror of the events sticks with her.
"I was scared," she said. "The scene I saw, there was no words for it. None at all. There is no describing what I saw."
McLendon then shot and killed two bystanders in Samson before heading to Reliable Metal Products. There, he exchanged fire with Myers and another officer in the parking lot before entering the building, where he shot and killed himself.
"We truly are shocked at this," said Col. Christopher Murphy, the director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. "This event formed the single deadliest crime recorded in Alabama." Watch a timeline of the shootings »

"I coached him in both T-ball and Little League baseball along with my two sons," he said of McLendon.
McLendon worked nearly two years at food manufacturer and distributor Kelley Foods in Elba, about 25 miles north of Samson.
He quit his job last week, the company said. The company didn't specify what his position was, but said he was a "reliable team leader" who was well-liked.
"I can't describe what happened, why it happened," Geneva County Sheriff Greg Ward told CNN affiliate WTVY. "It's just a sad day for Geneva County." Watch Sheriff Ward talk about the shootings »
"He was shooting at just ordinary people going about their business," said Alabama state Sen. Harri Anne Smith.

<http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/17/alabama.shooting.witness/index.html> dct:description """(CNN) -- There was nothing about last Friday's biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville that portended the carnage that was to come, Professor Debra Moriarity told a reporter Wednesday.
"It was actually a really laid-back, mundane kind of faculty meeting," the biochemist told CNN affiliate WAAY about the 13 people seated around an oval table in Room 369 of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology. "Events coming up, scheduling classes, budgets. It was really actually one of the easiest faculty meetings we've had."
Among the participants was Amy Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist with whom Moriarity had developed a professional relationship nurtured by the fact that the two women worked with cell cultures. "Sometimes you borrow things back and forth from each other," she said. "We had talked about writing grant proposals together."
After about an hour, just before 4 p.m., Bishop -- who had recently been denied tenure -- ended the calm. "All of a sudden, she just stood up and shot," Moriarity said.
Moriarity reacted quickly, dropping onto her hands and knees on the gray carpet. "Just dropped to the floor and crawled under the table and crawled towards Amy," said Moriarity, who was focused on one thing.
"I mean, you're crawling under a table, you see the legs of a person who's shooting above the table. I grabbed her leg and, I don't know what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking anything. I was just thinking: 'Grab her!'
"And she sidestepped me. I mean, she pulled her leg free and I was in the doorway then with my back kind of to her. And I think she tried to shoot at me then, but that's when I started yelling at her, 'Amy, Amy, think about my grandson, think about my daughter! This is me! I've helped you before; I'll help you again! Don't do this Amy! Don't do this!'"
Bishop then stepped out into the hall, pointed the gun at Moriarity and pulled the trigger, the biologist said. "It clicked, and it clicked again, and I crawled right back in the room and shut the door and she was left out in the hall."
The survivors burst into action. One person locked the wooden door, another shoved a table against it, others moved a refrigerator into place to further block the door, another called 911, others moved to help the six people who had been shot, Moriarity said.
Three people died; three others were wounded. Two of them remained hospitalized Wednesday in critical condition, according to a spokeswoman for Huntsville Hospital. The third has been released.
Moriarity, who joined the school's faculty in 1984, said the casualties have not affected her plans to remain at the school. And she rejected any suggestion that her role in getting Bishop out of the room was heroic.
"She followed me out in the hall and then the gun jammed and I could get back in the room," Moriarity said. "That's not being a hero. That's just God looks out for you."
She said she had had little time to think. "From the beginning until we finally got things barricaded, it couldn't have been more than 20 seconds," she said.
Moriarity further rejected suggestions that anything could have been done to protect the victims. "There was no way to ever anticipate this," she said. "And there was nothing that could ever have been done to stop her. It all happened too fast."
And she worried that any attempt to tighten security could have negative consequences. "There is evil in the world; it is unfortunate that good people are hurt by that. But a university is a place of free thought and freedom to explore ideas and to search out new knowledge and you don't want to put anything in place that dampens that."
Moriarity returned to her office on Wednesday and said she plans to resume teaching next week. She predicted that, with the help of anti-anxiety medication, she would be able to sleep Wednesday night.
"I've been talking to family and friends and just getting their support helps you deal with it," she said. "I think right now most of us want to get back there and get things going, make plans for who is going to cover classes."
A memorial service to honor the lives of the dead -- faculty members Maria Davis, Adriel Johnson and Gopi Podila -- is to be held Friday.""" ;

<http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/21/arizona.shooting/index.html> dct:description """(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was successfully transferred Friday to a Houston hospital from Tucson, Arizona, and physicians described the brain-injured congresswoman as "doing great."
"I'm very pleased to bring the news that the transfer of Gabby from the University Medical Center in Tucson to Memorial Hermann Hospital here went flawlessly," Dr. Randall Friese of the UMC Trauma Center said at a Houston news conference.
While saying an assassin's bullet "did damage some portions" of Giffords' brain, Dr. John Holcomb of Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center said Giffords is "doing great."
"She could have been a lot worse," Holcomb said. "This was a tangential gunshot wound. Fortunately, it didn't go crosswise" through her brain, he said.
Dr. Dong Kim of Memorial Hermann said a 30-minute exam of Giffords found that she has "very good movement on the left side of her body." He added that her physical therapy and rehabilitation will be a four- to six-month process.
"We tested her vision and she didn't like us shining the light in her eyes and wanted to keep them closed, and these are all very good signs," Kim said.
"She also had pretty good tone in her leg," he said. "She just looked spectacular."
But, he said, "there are varying stages of what we call paralysis or weakness" on her right side.
"In her arm, we are not seeing much tone and we're not seeing much movement," Kim said. But he noted that Giffords did show movement in her arms during her hospitalization in Tucson, so results could change.
"We really think over the next few months she's going to do remarkably well," Kim said. "There's no question that she is aware of what's happening."
Giffords is able to move her lips, Kim said. "Whether she can mouth words, we'll have to wait and see," he added.
Portions of Giffords' skull that were removed are still frozen in a sterile bag, and it could be weeks, if not months, before those portions are surgically returned to her head, doctors said.
"The transfer of that is not a big deal," Kim said of such surgery.
Giffords has been in intensive care for the past 13 days since she was shot in the head January 8 during a meet-and-greet outside a Tucson supermarket. Physicians expressed concern Friday about infection, saying they will be monitoring that over the next few days.
Friese, who accompanied Giffords in the ambulance ride in Tucson from the hospital to the airport, said that Giffords could hear the cheers of well-wishers from the sidewalks Friday.
"She smiled and actually began to tear a little bit," Friese said.
Giffords left the Tucson hospital where she had been treated since alleged assassin Jared Lee Loughner, now in custody, shot her in the head. Loughner, 22, is accused of killing six people, including a judge, and wounding a total of 13, including Giffords.
The congresswoman arrived at Houston Hobby International Airport shortly after 1 p.m. and was flown in a helicopter to Memorial Hermann.
Although previous reports had indicated she would move directly to a rehabilitation facility affiliated with the hospital, she instead was taken to the hospital's trauma center for evaluation and treatment, Kim said.
"She's not quite ready for rehabilitation yet," he said, citing concerns about ongoing medical issues. He declined to elaborate.
The hospital said in a statement that she will be transferred to the rehabilitation facility, TIRR Memorial Hermann, when her health allows.
Giffords left the Tucson hospital in an ambulance escorted by police and a group of motorcyclists from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The procession traveled to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, where she was carried aboard an airplane for the flight to Houston.
The move is the latest in a string of milestones for Giffords since the 40-year-old congresswoman was shot in the forehead.
On Thursday, she was able to go outside for the first time since the shooting.
"Today, actually, we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy," Dr. Peter Rhee told CNN's John King.
"We gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine," said Rhee, speaking from outside University Medical Center. "She was able to see the Arizona mountains."
Giffords' husband, Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, described his wife's progress as "remarkable" Thursday, saying he is hopeful she will make a full recovery.
"I've told her that," Kelly told reporters at University Medical Center. "She recognizes it. ... She is a fighter like nobody else that I know."
Giffords is able to stand with assistance, but is not yet able to take steps or walk, said Rhee, adding that therapists are helping Giffords with ways to express her thoughts and, eventually, speak.
"(We are) holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up," Rhee said. "She is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted."
On Wednesday, the public learned that Giffords was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance.
Kelly said he believes she has tried to speak, although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck; and he believes she is aware of her surroundings, saying he can look into her eyes and tell. She will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting, he said.
"Every time I interact with her, there's something quite inspiring," he said.
A federal grand jury indicted Loughner on Wednesday on three charges of attempted murder. The indictment charges Loughner with attempting to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon.
Legal experts said that more federal charges against Loughner are likely.
He is next set to appear in court Monday in Phoenix.
"I don't think we're ever going to fully understand the whys and the how and, you know, the reason for what happened on the 8th of January," Kelly told reporters. "It's a loss of innocent life. The injury of a dozen people, the death of a 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and the serious traumatic injury to my wife Gabrielle -- we'll never fully understand that."

"Since Gabby arrived last Friday, we noticed daily improvement in her neurological condition," Dr. Dong Kim, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical School, said during Wednesday's media briefing. "In terms of recovering from brain issues, this is really at lightning speed."
Giffords is still unable to speak, and she's unable to sit or stand on her own, doctors said. The Arizona Democrat, who survived an assassination attempt, was moved from a Houston hospital to a nearby rehabilitation hospital on Wednesday after doctors upgraded her condition to good from serious.
Giffords is now receiving therapies in The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research Memorial Hermann, also known as TIRR Memorial Hermann, according to Rebecca Moran, spokeswoman for Memorial Hermann.
"She is undertaking the physical therapy and occupational therapy and speech therapy this afternoon," Kim said at the briefing.
Meanwhile, Jared Lee Loughner, who allegedly tried to assassinate Giffords, had spent time searching the internet and was curious about others who had pulled off political assassinations, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The story was first reported in The Washington Post online Wednesday.
Loughner spent time on the internet as he was allegedly getting ready to carry out a gun attack on Giffords, and Loughner's personal computer, seized by authorities following the attack, indicates he was surfing various websites about political killers, the source told CNN.
The law enforcement source declined to identify whom Loughner had researched. The source requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation.
Loughner also looked at information about lethal injections and solitary confinement, according to the source. He visited the websites in the weeks and even days leading up to the shooting, the source added.
Thirty-two shots were fired in the January 8 rampage that killed six people -- including a chief federal judge, a 9-year old girl and two congressional aides -- and wounded 13 more peopel, including Giffords, who was shot in the head at an outdoor "meet and greet" with constituents.
Loughner is charged with trying to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Federal prosecutors have indicated more charges are forthcoming.
In Houston, Giffords' upgraded condition was announced late Tuesday after her husband, Mark Kelly, said she had watched an hour of television from her hospital bed.
Kelly called the development "exciting," said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida and a friend of Giffords.
"Last night or the night before she watched television -- it was CNN in fact --- and the fact that she was able to do that for about an hour, in terms of attention span, they were pretty excited about that," Wasserman Schultz said.
Kelly remains optimistic that his wife will make a full recovery, she said.
"Doctors continue to tell them they're hopeful about how much she'll recover. With each day, she's able to do things that are a little more complex than she had been doing before," she said.

(CNN) -- Accused Tucson gunman Jared Lee Loughner has been indicted on 49 counts including murder and attempted murder that stem from a shooting that left six people dead and critically wounded Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
A grand jury had indicted Loughner, 22, on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during an event for constituents at a Tucson grocery store in January.
Giffords is currently undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston, Texas.
The new indictment, returned by a federal grand jury Thursday, includes those three charges and adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. He also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G.
Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting.
A charge of attempted assassination of a member of Congress also is among the 49 counts.
"The deceased are not the only ones whose rights are being defended," U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke said in a news release. "Those citizens who were peaceably assembled to speak to their member of Congress are also named victims in this indictment."
The indictment carries a potential death sentence if convicted, Burke added, although prosecutors have not said yet whether they will seek the death penalty.
"We will seek justice for the federal officials, Judge Roll and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, and for Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and C-T G," Burke said.
The alleged gunman previously had faced two murder charges in the deaths of Roll and Zimmerman, but in a procedural maneuver, prosecutors had temporarily dropped those charges, bringing them back under the superseding indictment.
Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, is expected to be arraigned on the new charges March 9 in Tucson, the district attorney's office said.
Also Friday, Giffords' office released a picture of her taken the morning of the shooting. The congresswoman is seen standing in front of the grocery store, talking to constituents identified by her office as Jim and Doris Tucker.
Jim Tucker was shot twice, once in his calf and once in his collarbone, according to CNN affiliate KOLD. His wife escaped unharmed.
"I've wondered since the very beginning, 'Why wasn't I shot?' but I just take it as a miracle from God that I wasn't, for some purpose," Doris Tucker has told the network.""" ;

Yes, Ultra released a statement, but it seems like people in power have the ammo ready to start reevaluating this festival's place in Miami in the future, especially when you consider that reports state there were 76 arrests (28 of them being felony charges) and 118 hospitalized over this three-day period.
As always, DAD will keep you posted on future developments with this situation.

For a summary of preliminary ice accumulations click here .
A slow moving storm system brought a long duration of freezing rain to a large portion of the nation's mid section. After several rounds of minor snow and ice accumulations over the past week, a major storm system produced one final blow, capping the region with significant ice accumulations. The event began early Monday evening and continued into the early evening hours on Tuesday. Very warm and moist air aloft was brought in ahead of a large storm system moving slowly out of the southwest United States. At the surface, Canadian high pressure which had been in firm control over much of the past week, helped keep temperatures near ground level in the upper 20s to lower 30s. With surface temperatures at or below freezing, combined with a warm layer of air just above the surface, the precipiation fell in the form of freezing rain. As precipitation rates increased quickly Monday evening, ice rapidly accumulated on many surfaces, especially trees and power lines. Locally, ice accumulation was particularly devistating along and north of the Missouri river extending into adjacent northeast Kansas. Ice accumulations of 3/4" were common, with isolated accumulations around 1" generally north of a line from Atchison, Kansas through Trenton, Missouri to Unionville, Missouri. Further south, temperatures warmed during the overnight, and by dawn hovered between 32 and 34 degrees. As a result, ice accumulations between 1/4" and 1/2" were noted along the Interstate 70 corridor, with lesser amounts further south.
Area electricity providers are reporting widespread power outages across portions of eastern Kansas and northwest Missouri this evening. The most hard hit areas extended from near Manhattan, Kansas through St Joseph, Missouri, and into southwest Iowa, where estimates are that nearly 75% of customers remain without power. Specifically, in communities along and north of US Highway 36, and west of Interstate 35, numerous fallen larger tree branches and downed power lines have been reported. As of 5PM Tuesday, December 11, providers are estimating that over 165,000 Missouri residents were without electricity.
Precipitation began to wind down Tuesday evening. However, additional power outages and damage were caused as north winds of 15 to 20 mph buffeted northern Missouri through the late evening. As temperatures fell quickly back through the 20s, wet roadways quickly refroze, resulting in widespread black ice. Several multiple vehicle accidents were reported during the evening hours Monday along major interstate routes as travelers suddenly found wet roadways had turned to a thin sheet of ice. Conditions had largely improved by Wednesday morning as roads were treated and dried out. Now eyes turn toward the potential for accumulating snows across central and southern Missouri Friday night and Saturday.

A winter storm brought light to moderate snow accumulations to southeast Kansas and the Missouri Ozarks Saturday December 15th. Precipitation began as a wintry mix of freezing rain...sleet andsnow Friday night with the first round of the storm. The second round brought snow to the region Saturday afternoon and evening. Total snow accumulations generally ranged from one to two inches north of interstate 44 with less than an inch to the south. Heavier accumulations of 3 to 4 inches fell across portions of Central Missouri from the Lake of the Ozarks region east to Rolla and Salem. Even higher snow amounts of up to 8 inches fell further northeast in the St. Louis area as the storm system continued to intensify.
A couple of factors limited snow accumulations across the Missouri Ozarks and southeast Kansas. First a thin layer of warm air aloft kept precipitation from changing over to snow as quickly Friday night. On Saturday the primary storm system did not intensify until it tracked northeast toward the St. Louis area.

<http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/saskatchewan-will-reach-out-to-u-s-officials-after-la-loche-shooting-wall-1.2749780> dct:description """REGINA -- Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall says his province is in touch with officials in the United States for help rebuilding after a school shooting.
Wall said the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, called him Friday after four people were killed at the school and in a nearby home in the northern Saskatchewan community of La Loche.
"He noted that, quite tragically, the United States has more experience," Wall said.
"He offered that perhaps those communities where these types of events have occurred in the past in his country ... they might be able to provide some counsel, some support, some ideas around approaches for the days ahead."
Wall said he has asked his deputy minister to "canvass that option with our American friends to find out perhaps what has worked better maybe than some other things."
There have been many mass shootings at American schools in recent years, most notably one at Columbine high school Colorado that killed in 12 students and a teacher in 1999 and one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and 6 staff in 2012.
Heyman sent out a statement after the La Loche shooting to express his condolences and solidarity.
"We have experienced similar tragedies far too often in the United States and understand all too well the heartache and sadness that result from such a horrific event," he said.
RCMP have charged a 17-year-old boy in the La Loche shooting with four counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder. He is to appear in court next week.""" ;

<http://www.dailytitan.com/2006/05/bloodspillsinlibraryhallways/> dct:description """It’s still relatively early on a Monday morning when a beige Dodge pulls into the parking lot on the west side of the Cal State Fullerton library. A 22-caliber rifle lies on the front passenger seat.
The man who gets out looks younger than his 37 years, with shaggy, collar-length brown hair swept loosely across his forehead. He carries the rifle in his right hand and a box of bullets in his left as he casually walks toward the library.
His shooting rampage would last not more than five minutes. Police received the phone call just before 9 a.m.:
“I went berserk at Cal State Fullerton, and I committed some terrible act . I’d appreciate it if you people would come down and pick me up . I’m unarmed, and I’m giving myself up to you.”
Orange County’s bloodiest homicide happened on July 12, 1976 when CSUF library janitor Edward Charles Allaway gunned down nine of his coworkers. He killed seven.
A Superior Court jury found Allaway not guilty by reason of insanity. Psychiatrists, who interviewed Allaway after his arrest, said he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, a condition exacerbated by Allaway’s recent separation from his second wife. He suffered from hallucinations, they said.
Allaway had come to believe that certain co-workers were forcing his estranged wife to participate in perverse pornographic films. They would eventually murder her, Allaway thought. They would murder him too.
He seemed “to have been almost out of contact with reality and reacting to his hallucinations, delusions and some ideas of exterior control,” psychiatrist Daniel Castile wrote after interviewing Allaway when he was in custody. “It seems improbable that he would have been able to meaningfully deliberate and contemplate the nature, quality and wrongness of his actions.”
On the morning of the shootings, Allaway entered a stairwell in the library and made his way down to the basement.
Secretary Karen Dwinell sat in her office adjacent to the stairwell, talking with photographer Paul Herzberg and media center assistant Bruce Jacobsen, according to her court testimony. The time was around 8:30 a.m.
She heard a sound like a firecracker. Then Allaway stepped into her office doorway, staring silently, blankly at Dwinell. He pointed his rifle at her. Herzberg stepped between the two and Allaway fired two shots. Herzberg fell, bleeding from the head and chest.
Allaway shot once more into the room before he stepped back into the 150-foot hallway, and he hit a fleeing Jacobsen for a second time in the chest. Dwinell looked on helplessly, frozen in shock as the firing continued.
In the hallway, Allaway turned to his left and took aim at the graphics department at the end of the hallway, where designer Frank Teplansky and professor emeritus Seth Fesseden were working.
He killed Fesseden instantly. Teplansky, who was shot in the head, died a few hours later at St. Jude Hospital.
Allaway turned back the way he came and happened across fellow custodians Debra Paulsen and Donald Karges at the other end of the hallway. He fired a few rounds before he began to chase the two. The slap of running footsteps echoed through the corridor, then remonstrating screams, then the sound of firecrackers.
Then silence.
The weapon, Allaway would say during a psychiatric evaluation, “was not as a rifle really is.” It would serve as a mediator, a way for Allaway to talk to his persecutors and save his wife from her torture, he thought.
Allaway returned to the stairwell to reload his rifle, which housed 18 rounds.
He continued up the stairs to the library lobby and headed toward the elevators on the west side of the building. There he encountered morning-shift janitorial supervisor Maynard Hoffman.
“How would you like a shot, Maynard,” witnesses heard Allaway ask. “Did that feel good?”
As Allaway watched a still-breathing Hoffman crumble inside the bullet-riddled elevator, someone came from behind him and struck him over the head with a large plate. Earthenware pieces scattered all over the floor, and library technician Steven Becker attempted to wrestle the rifle from Allaway’s grasp, but the rifle exploded.
Becker stumbled away. Library supervisor Don Keran heard the commotion and came to help, according to his court testimony. He wrapped Allaway in a bear hug, and then the two crashed over tables and chairs. They breathed heavily and said nothing as they fought for control of the weapon. Allaway shoved Keran against a wall. Keran shoved back.
Then Keran ran out of wall, and he fell onto his back. Allaway stood over him, dangling the rifle inches from Keran’s body. Keran squirmed and tried to use his elbows to get back to his feet. Allaway pulled the trigger.
Then Allaway ran through an emergency exit to a courtyard on the south side of the library. An injured Becker gave chase. He would be the last to die. Allaway caught sight of his unarmed pursuer and raised his rifle.
Becker staggered 20 feet before collapsing near the fire hydrant at the south east side of the building.
Allaway retraced his steps again, re-entering the library from the east side on his way back to his car. He bled from a cut just above his left eyebrow; his clothes were spattered with blood.
Allaway eluded University Police and drove to the Anaheim Hilton Inn, where his estranged wife was on duty. He asked her for a glass of water and a dime so he could make a phone call.
Police burst into the hotel banquet room where an unarmed Allaway was waiting for them. They tackled Allaway and cuffed him before leading him to the squad car parked outside. They found a rifle wrapped in a blanket in Allaway’s backseat.
In the following days, Allaway would be charged with six counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, though in Allaway’s mind his five-minute shooting spree was the only way to save his estranged wife from being tortured. It was the only way to ultimately save himself.
“If the law sincerely tried to find out [the truth], and even use a lie detector – if I’m wrong, then they can hang me,” Allaway later said. “I’m totally scared and alone. I feel like I’ve professionally and profoundly been brainwashed.”""" ;

Intelligence sources said the drone targeted a militant compound in Cort Village of Nazyan, completely destroying the compound. Aside from the eight dead, scores of others were reportedly injured on the zero line, which has been serving as a safe haven for the Mullah Fazllullah led Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to security officials, militants based in the Nazyan district had planned the devastating attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, which left over 140 children and teachers dead and scores injured.

Soon after the attack in Peshawar, army chief General Raheel Sharif in an unscheduled visit to Kabul had been given assurances by the Afghan government as well as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf) for action against a Kunar-based Taliban splinter group which is believed to have been behind the attack.

The strikes against militants have increased on both sides of the border since the attack.
Pakistani security forces have also been carrying out ground offensives in Khyber Agency, particularly the Tirah Valley of Bara which borders Nazyan.
A military operation titled 'Khyber One' which was launched in October by security forces and aimed at targeting militants in Khyber Agency’s Bara area is also underway in the northwestern tribal region.

Eighteen militants were killed in the ground offensive last night in Khyber Agency, while early Friday morning, an operation killed at least 50 terrorists in the Wurmagai and Spurkot areas of Tirah valley while they were moving towards Afghanistan. The militants fled leaving behind the dead bodies of their companions – photos of which have been circulating on social media.

“Schools with not enough security arrangements would not be allowed to reopen,” KP Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani had said on Jan 8. Government monitors would assess security measures taken at the schools, he had added.
Senior Superintended of Police Dr Mian Mohammad Saeed told Dawn that officials of different police stations had inspected 1,440 schools in Peshawar. Out of these, only 118 schools were given NOCs, he said. Security arrangements at 1,380 schools are not satisfactory, he said, adding that such schools had been issued a security advisory.

Besides, the SSP said that police would be on high alert from early morning until the end of school hours. All police mobile vans would be moving on roads to ensure security to the schools, he said.
However, many schools which were not issued NOCs have already resumed operations in the rural areas of the province.
Earlier, the provincial government had to face criticism by educationists over its failure to announce a final date for the reopening of local schools, saying the extension in winter vacation had been adversely affecting the studies of school children.
Moreover, Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif also attended a commemorative service held at Peshawar's Army Public School in honour of those who had lost their lives during the Dec 16 Taliban attack on the school.
A tweet by Director General Inter-Services Public Relations Major General Asim Bajwa said Gen Raheel also met with students and teachers at APS.
Strict security arrangements were seen in place for the re-opening of APS in Peshawar. The Army Public School management told Dawn that psychological counselling sessions would be given to staff and students till Jan 17, whereas regular academic session would begin from Jan 19.
Furthermore, a meeting of officials from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas decided to resume school activities in the region from tomorrow (Tuesday).
Notices were also issued to political agents and teachers to resume educational activities in 5,686 registered schools in the region.
Due to security reasons, the political administration has decided to keep schools closed in Bara.

Imran, Reham advised to postpone APS visit
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan said Monday that he and his wife Reham Khan were advised to postpone their visit to Peshawar's Army Public School due to the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Raheel Sharif's visit.
Khan tweeted that he, along with his wife Reham and KP Chief Minister Pervez Khattak, were going to visit the APS today but they were advised to postpone their visit in view of the COAS's visit for what they were told was a soft opening of the school. He, however, said that they would visit the children later this week.""" ;

<http://www.dawn.com/news/1156968> dct:description """As children began returning to schools across Pakistan weeks after the siege of Peshawar's Army Public School, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released a poignant musical tribute to commemorate the 131 children slain last month in the horrific attack.
With a young child’s voice lending melody to the lyrics, the song which was released on Monday conveys a message from a slain child to extremists in response to the massacre. The message is one of conviction and resilience; that the children cannot be frightened anymore.
The main verse of the song is also packed with emotion:
Main aisi qoum se hoon jis kay woh bachon se darta hai … Bara dushman bana phirta hai jo bachon se larta hai
I am from a nation whose children frighten him… Some enemy he is, he who targets children
The attack on the school resulted in widespread condemnation from national and international quarters with the government quickly scrambling into action. A National Action Plan was then developed in order to tackle the growing problem; the premier lifted the moratorium on capital punishment and the army chief rushed to Kabul to tie up with the Afghan security establishment in order to effectively tackle cross border attacks.
On the day of the attack, DG ISPR Major-General Asim Bajwa in a tweet quoted the army chief as saying that the terrorists had struck at "the heart" of Pakistan:
Focused on the idea that a war should never be against children, the lyrics of the song were penned by ISPR officials.
Aside from paying tribute to the lost lives, the song enunciates a direct message to the proponents of extremism that while 131 children were brutally deprived of their lives, their legacy remains alive and so do their friends and members of their families who will continue to study, struggle for justice on their behalf and make a difference in their varying, respective capacities.
The three-and-a-half minute long video shows the downcast but determined faces of children singing and holding posters that display slogans of conviction and solidarity. Some are shown returning to the school after it closed down owing to what is regarded as one of the worst acts of violence in Pakistan’s history.
The video ends with a principal welcoming the students back to school as they arrive in a school auditorium.
Following are some reactions to the song:
Complete lyrics and translation
Bata kia puchta hai woh, kitabon mein miloon ga mein
What is he searching for, I live on in books
Kiye maa se hain jo maine kiye waadon mein miloon ga mein
I will be found in the promises I made to my mother
Main aaney wala kal hoon woh mujhe kyun aaj marey gaa
I am the future, how can he slay me today?
Ye uska vehem hoga kay woh aisey khwaab marey ga
He has to be delusional if he believes he can kill such dreams
Tumhara khoon hoon na isliye acha lara hoon mein
I am your blood, hence I’ve fought valiantly
Bata aya hoon dushman ko kay us se to bara hoon mein
I have proven to the enemy that I am greater than him
Main aisi qoum se hoon jiske woh bachon se darta hai
I am from a nation whose children frighten him
Bara dushman bana phirta hai jo bachon se larta hai
Some enemy he is, he who targets children
To jab atey hue mujhko galey tumne lagaya tha
So when you hugged me as I departed
Amanallah kahan mujhko mera beta bulaya tha
You did not call me Amanallah, my son
Khuda kay amn ki raah mein kahan se agaya tha woh
How did he cross into God’s path of peace
Jahan tum choomti theen maa wahan tak agaya tha woh
He came as far as the spot where you used to kiss me, mother

<http://www.dawn.com/news/1232465#comments> dct:description """ISTANBUL: At least 10 people were killed after an explosion rocked a central Istanbul square on Tuesday, and several others were wounded, Turkey's Haberturk television said.
The Hurriyet daily quoted Istanbul's governor's office saying that 10 people have been killed while at least 15 people have been reported wounded in the explosion near Sultanahmet square of Istanbul's Fatih district.
“Investigations into the cause of the explosion, the type of explosion and perpetrator or perpetrators are underway,” Istanbul's governor's office said in a statement quoted by the Dogan news agency.
Tourists were also reported among the victims of the explosion.
State-run TRT television reported that Turkish police officials have confirmed the explosion was a suicide bombing with several dead.
Tweet by RT showing a picture of the blast site
Map shows the location of the blast site
Private NTV television said the explosion was close to a park that is home to a landmark obelisk. The state-run Anadolu Agency says several police and medics were sent to the area.
Police sealed the area, barring people from approaching in case of a second explosion.
“We're taking precautions against a second explosion,” a police officer said, ushering people out of the square.
The Sultanahmet neighborhood is Istanbul's main sight-seeing area and includes the Topkapi Palace and Blue Mosque.
'The explosion was very loud'
“The explosion was very loud. We shook a lot. We ran out and saw body parts,” one woman who works at a nearby antiques store told a Reuters correspondent, declining to give her name.
The explosion at around 10:20 am close to Dikilitaş was heard by nearby districts, according to witnesses.
Witnesses reported hearing a loud blast, and video footage on the CNN Türk station showed police and ambulances at the scene, according to the Zaman newspaper.
Erdem Koroglu, who was working at a nearby office at the time of the explosion, told NTV television he saw several people lying on the ground following the blast.
“It was difficult to say who was alive or dead,” Koroglu said. “Buildings rattled from the force of the explosion.”
The victims were shifted to nearby hospitals, mainly Haseki Training and Research Hospital.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed grief and sorrow over the blast, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office.
Turkey suffered two major bombing attacks last year.
More than 30 people were killed in an Islamic State suicide attack in the town of Suruc, near Turkey's border with Syria, in July.
Two suicide bombs in October outside Ankara's main train station as people gathered for a peace rally killed more than 100 people. It was Turkey's deadliest attack. The prosecutor's office said the attack was carried out by a local Islamic State cell.
Germany warns nationals to avoid Istanbul tourist sites: ministry
Germany on Tuesday warned its citizens to avoid crowds and tourist sites in Istanbul after 10 people were killed and 15 wounded in a suspected terrorist attack in Turkey's largest city.
“Travellers in Istanbul are strongly urged to avoid for now large groups of people in public places as well as tourist attractions and to stay abreast of the situation via these official travel advisories and the media,” the foreign ministry said.""" ;

By Sgt. Jim Greenhill, USA
Special to American Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5, 2007  National Guard troops in eight states rescued people and hauled hay to livestock following a severe end-of-year winter storm that stretched from America’s northern to southern borders. At least 13 people in five states died in the storm.
Wyoming Air National Guard loadmasters aboard a C-130 Hercules aircraft watch as a 1-ton hay bale lands near a herd of cows during an emergency feeding mission in southeast Colorado Jan. 3. The hay was dropped near La Junta, Colo., to help feed livestock that have been stranded from a snowstorm that has impacted the area. Photo by Senior Master Sgt. John Rohrer, USAF

Hundreds of Guard members in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington – sometimes assisted by other states – spent their holiday season rescuing stranded motorists, carrying medical supplies and restoring power. In Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico, Guard members dropped hay from helicopters to starving cattle.
“That responsibility is one of our primary missions, and we have always responded,” Air Force Maj. Gen. Mason Whitney, Colorado’s adjutant general, told American Forces Information Service. “That’s the strength of the National Guard. We are the forward-deployed forces in communities across America for the homeland defense and emergency response mission.”
In Colorado, vehicles stranded by a pre-Christmas snowstorm that dumped 30 inches in the mountains and nine inches on the plains rendered Interstate 25 impassable, and Guardmembers helped state troopers clear the road. Drivers were stranded on I-25, US-52 and I-70. Hundreds of miles of interstates were closed.
Colorado
About 60 Colorado National Guard members rescued dozens of stranded motorists after the most powerful snowstorm in almost four years.
“They’re telling me it’s zero visibility,” Whitney said. “They’ll kind of bump into something, and it’ll turn out to be a car with people in it.”
The Guard conducted search-and-rescue missions, provided emergency medical transport and carried supplies to Red Cross shelters.
Citizen-soldiers and -airmen took food and water to thousands of travelers trapped at Denver International Airport, closed more than two days by the storm.
Five days after the Colorado Guard stood down from that first storm, it swung into action again before the severe blizzard conditions of Dec. 28 and 29. The Guard’s joint forces headquarters issued a warning order as the second storm approached.
Colorado Guard leaders anticipated that the new storm centered on Denver and Colorado Springs on top of previously accumulated snow could again threaten lives and further disrupt travel. Even before assistance was requested, the Colorado Guard prepared dozens of high-ground-clearance vehicles and aviation assets to aid local emergency responders. Some 166 Guard members stayed overnight at armories to be in position ahead of time.
Challenges included snowfall that varied from seven to 30 inches and was blown by 70 mph wind gusts, forming drifts up to six feet high across roads. Hundreds of motorists were stranded, including tour bus passengers rescued by the Guard on US-287 in Prowers County. Roads, including intersates, were again closed. The same storm moved down to New Mexico and then on to the Texas Panhandle.
Guard members took food, water, blankets and cots to shelters that ran low on supplies. People were trapped in their homes. Power was cut off. The domino effect of disrupted transportation corridors caused grocery stores across the Rocky Mountain states to run short of food for days. Gov. Bill Owens declared an emergency.
More than 126 Colorado Guard members patrolled on the ground and in the air to rescue stranded motorists, provided medical aid to five people and medical transport and distributed medicine, baby formula and other critical supplies to isolated areas along the state’s Front Range.
“It’s amazing to see how people work so well together under stressful conditions,” Capt. Jason Stuchlik, 2nd Battalion, 157th Field Artillery, told The Pueblo Chief. Previously, Stuchlik’s unit was part of the National Guard’s historic response to Hurricane Katrina.
“We are seeing another extreme, from hot to cold,” he said. “The Katrina effort has made us more prepared for this situation.”
Guard members rescued 134 people, recovered four emergency response vehicles and eight private vehicles.
They conducted medical resupply missions and, backed by Guard members and air assets from Oklahoma and Wyoming, dropped hundreds of bales of hay to some of an estimated 345,000 cattle stranded by 10-foot snowdrifts and facing starvation. In 1997, 30,000 cattle died in a Colorado snowstorm.
“You can tell immediately where they are,” Whitney told CBS News. “You’ll see a bunch of dark spots clustered together in a sea of white.”
Guard helicopters also dropped Meals Ready to Eat outside remote homes.
“It’s the middle of nowhere,” Sgt. 1st Class Steve Segin told CBS News. “You lose the power, you might as well be in 1885. There’s no cell phone, no lights, no contact.”
Kansas
Some 114 Army and Air National Guard members assisted at emergency shelters and provided power, supplies and transportation after 15 to 36 inches of snow stranded motorists, emergency services and medical personnel in roadside areas in western Kansas.
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius declared a disaster area in 44 counties after the storm that brought 13-foot snowdrifts. More than 60,000 customers were without power for up to a week after about 8,000 transmission poles were downed.
Some 3.7 million head of cattle, worth $3.4 billion, are located in the affected counties, it was reported Jan. 5.
A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter stood by for rescues as Guard members helped with house-to-house welfare checks. Four armories served as shelters. Accumulating snow caused a fire department building to collapse, and the Kansas National Guard provided an armory for emergency responders. A Black Hawk dropped hay to snow- and ice-bound cattle.
Kansas and Colorado agreed to support lifesaving cross-border operations.
Nebraska
About seven Nebraska National Guard members helped utility workers restore power to about 35,000 people left without power for up to a week after the storm downed an estimated 38 major transmission lines in central Nebraska. An OH-58 Kiowa helicopter and a Black Hawk helped power officials assess damage.
Western and north-central Nebraska faced freezing rain, heavy snow and strong winds. Some trees had a three-inch layer of ice.
New Mexico
About 20 members of the New Mexico National Guard used a dozen high-wheeled vehicles and helicopters to provide emergency medical assistance and rescue stranded motorists, hunters and residents of remote areas.
The record-setting storm turned the desert white and canceled flights. This occurred after a year that had already seen New Mexico Guard members patrolling the border with Mexico as part of Operation Jump Start and providing potable water and equipment to drought-stricken communities, in addition to overseas missions and continued counter-drug activity.
A Black Hawk helicopter crew rescued a stranded heart transplant patient. Another ferried a bulldozer operator to awaiting equipment so he could help ranchers get to cattle. Guard members also rescued four hunters and pulled people from five stranded vehicles. They provided cots to citizens in three cities.
Gov. Bill Richardson ordered more National Guard Black Hawks to check on residents’ welfare and drop hay.
“We’re taking this extraordinary step to assist our farmers and ranchers as they struggle to save their livestock and dig out from the incredible snowfall,” Richardson told the Albuquerque Journal. More than 15 inches of snow fell on Albuquerque, an arid desert city.
The New Mexico National Guard also surveyed damage and delivered infant supplies to numerous homes, the governor’s office reported.
Oklahoma
An Oklahoma National Guard CH-47 Chinook helicopter joined a half-dozen Humvees as about 21 Guard members conducted air drops and search- and-recovery operations in Cimarron County, in the western part of the state, officials reported.
Even as it responded in its own state, the Oklahoma National Guard also sent five members to Colorado to operate a Chinook providing humanitarian and livestock supplies.
Oregon
A Chinook and two Black Hawk helicopters from the Oregon National Guard were joined by a C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Nevada National Guard in a quest to save three climbers missing on Mount Hood.
The plane was equipped with infrared and a zooming camera lens. “This is the only one in the Air Force, so if they want this technology. It’s coming from Reno,” Master Sgt. Craig Madole, 152nd Intelligence Squadron, Nevada Air National Guard, told the Nevada Appeal. The unit used the same technology during its response to Hurricane Katrina.
“Our hearts are going out to the families right now,” Capt. Mike Brabish, Oregon National Guard, told The Seattle Times after one climber’s body was found Dec. 17. The search for the other two will resume in the spring, officials said.
Texas
The Texas National Guard also anticipated the inclement weather, prepositioning about a dozen members at the Amarillo Armory who supported public safety workers in the Texas panhandle.
Washington
About 17 Guard members provided generators and other logistics to care centers for elderly people, wastewater treatment plants and other facilities after December windstorms knocked out power.

<http://www.dw.com/en/tunisia-to-close-80-mosques-following-terror-attack/a-18544478> dct:description """Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid announced on Friday that the government will be shutting 80 mosques that are outside of state control on the grounds that they may incite violence. The plan, which will be carried out in the next week, follows an attack on a tourist resort hotel in the coastal city of Sousse, around 140 kilometers (87 miles) south of the capital Tunis.
Tunis also plans to crack down on financing for certain associations as a countermeasure against another attack.
The gunman had disguised himself as a tourist, hiding a rifle in an umbrella. He then opened fire on lounging tourists at the Imperial Marhaba hotel, killing 39 people including Britons, Germans and Belgians.
The attack was claimed by the jihadist group "Islamic State" (IS) who have been using social media to urge their followers to step up violence against their enemies during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
"Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate, Abu Yihya al-Kairouni, reached his target the Imperial hotel despite the security measures," said a statement on an IS-linked Twitter account. It continued that al-Kairouni had attacked what they called a brothel and killed 40 "infidels."
Three attacks in one day
At least one German and 15 Britons have been killed in the Sousse attack. The deaths came on the same day as two other IS-linked attacks as 27 people were killed and more than 270 wounded when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive inside a Shiite mosque in Kuwait City, Kuwait.
Earlier in southeastern France, a truck driver named Yassine Salhi hung his employer's severed head along with banners carrying inscriptions in Arabic on a factory gate before crashing his vehicle into the chemical warehouse. Salhi triggered an explosion that left two workers wounded.
Although no group claimed responsibility for the France attack, the severed head mimicked IS's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads.
Salhi was apprehended by the police shortly after the blast at the factory.

2000-Subtrop
Legend of sources
An unnamed tropical cyclone originated east of the Turks and Caicos in the Atlantic Ocean on October 25, 2000, traveled north, and entered the CHC Response Zone on October 28. The storm entered Canadian waters in the early morning hours of October 29, with winds of 102 km/h and then tracked northeast as it underwent transition to become a more fully extratropical storm. By the afternoon, the storm centre was located just south of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where it stalled and remained for more than a day, bringing a prolonged period of northeast winds across the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This turned out to be the most damaging storm of the year for Atlantic Canada. Record storm surge and near-record water levels occurred along eastern New Brunswick and northern Prince Edward Island causing extensive coastal flooding and damage. Fishermen in Prince Edward Island reported this to be the worst storm that they seen in more than 30 years.The end result was extensive and damaging coastal flooding costing in the tens of millions of dollars.

<http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=5BA5EAFC-1&offset=3&toc=show> dct:description """A summery air mass with embedded “garden-variety” thunderstorms tracked across much of southern Ontario during the afternoon and evening hours of July 8. The only thing worrying forecasters was its exceptionally high precipitable water content and slow motion. What had been an uneventful day began to change mid-afternoon when a small cluster of thunderstorms passed over Georgian Bay and continued south-southeastward. By 5:00 p.m. it was raining heavily at the centre of the storm just north of Highway 401 and at Toronto Pearson International Airport. At the same time, another weaker line of thunderstorms formed northwest of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and travelled southeastward toward the city’s downtown. By 5:30 pm the relatively weak storm blossomed dramatically. Suddenly, Toronto faced two separate storm cells – one on the heels of the other – that slowed then stalled over the city. The one-two weather punch delivered more rain in two hours than Toronto usually sees during an entire July. Moreover, the storms were targeting the most urbanized area in Canada. Rarely before had such a drenching thunderstorm soaked a surface with more cement than grass. The following rainfall totals (mm) from in and around the GTA help to illustrate the bull’s-eye target of the event on the downtown: Toronto Pearson 126.0; Toronto City 96.8; Toronto Island 85.5; Downsview 65.8; East York 51.5; Richmond Hill 19.8; Oshawa 4.8; Oakville 4.2; and Hamilton 4.2. The storm was noteworthy because of the rain’s intensity, far exceeding storm sewers’ capacity, which caused flooding runoff to travel along city streets to creeks and rivers. The majority f rain fell in two hours from approximately 4:20 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Many compared the storm’s rainfall to that from Hurricane Hazel in October 1954.
Exacerbating the storm’s impact was the 38 mm of rain that had fallen on the city the day before. Adding to that was an abnormally wet spring and early summer – the dampest since 2000. From April 1 to July 7, Toronto Pearson got between 50 and 75 per cent more rain than normal. And talk about timing. The storm hit during afternoon rush hour leaving millions of vulnerable commuters in transit between work and home. The 126.0 mm was a new daily rainfall record at the airport (station records date from November 1937) and a record for any July date (the previous daily rainfall record for July was set on July 28, 1980 when 118.5 mm of rain fell). The previous daily record for any day at Toronto Pearson was set during Hurricane Hazel when 121.4 mm fell on October 15, 1954. The July 8 storm also set a record for 30-minute and 1, 2, 6 and 12-hour rainfall totals at Toronto Pearson, all in excess of 100-year return periods. Interestingly, the storm’s daily rainfall was NOT the highest recorded value at any Environment Canada archived rain gauge within the GTA. At North York (Downsview), 140.6 mm of rain was recorded on August 19, 2005, with maximum accumulation of 175 mm (unofficial) in a Thornhill backyard. The highest historical daily rainfall outside of Toronto occurred northwest of Pearson Airport at Snelgrove where 181. 6 mm fell during Hurricane Hazel.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimated the July 8 storm costs at close to $1 billion in damages – the most expensive natural disaster ever in Toronto and Ontario. The storm caused major transit halts and delays, road closures, flight cancellations and flooding across Toronto and Mississauga. The epic rainfall left several roads and underpasses under water, forcing motorists to abandon their vehicles. Videos captured cars bobbing up and down on streets and highways, sinkholes opening up and snakes swimming inside stalled commuter trains. Thousands were stranded, necessitating rescue by boat in some instances. Others abandoned their vehicles and walked thigh-high in water along roads that looked more like canals. About 500,000 households, mainly in the GTA’s west end, were without power ranging from hours to days. Some 3,000 basements flooded in the rainstorm, causing major damages.""" ;

3. Ontario's Most Expensive Weather Disaster
On the afternoon of August 19, a line of severe thunderstorms tracked eastward across southern Ontario from Kitchener to Oshawa, including the northern half of Toronto. In its wake, the storm left a trail of damage that, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, represented the highest insured loss in the province's history, exceeding $500 million. That's more than two and a half times Ontario's losses during the infamous ice storm of 1998 and the second largest loss event in Canadian history.
Literally dozens of thunderstorms were popping up at any one time. At its worst, the system spawned two F2 tornadoes with gusts between 180 and 250 km/h. The first tornado tracked through Milverton to Conestogo Lake (west of Elmira). The second moved from Salem to Lake Bellwood (north of Guelph). The twisters uprooted hundreds of trees, chewed the limbs off of countless others, downed power lines, tossed cars and trucks aside, and ripped into several homes, cottages and barns. To illustrate the storm's incredible force, at one farm, the twisting winds drove a ballpoint pen seven centimetres deep into a tree, splitting the trunk.
Although a rare tornado warning was issued for Toronto, the storm packed a different wallop as it approached from the northwest. The storm featured torrential rains, quarter- to golf-ball size hail, strong straight-line winds and flash flooding. During the height of the tempest, wind gusts peaked at 72 km/h and there were 1,400 lightning strikes per minute. However, it was the flash flooding that caused the greatest destruction. The storm dumped 103 mm of rain in one hour across a swath of North York and surrounding area. That compares to 53 mm in one hour from Hurricane Hazel in 1954. At Environment Canada's Downsview offices, 130 mm of rain fell - 100 mm in less than an hour - an unprecedented amount for any storm in Toronto, and easily greater than the one in one hundred years storm. The deluge flooded two floors of the Downsview building, prompting employees to huddle in the basement and interior auditorium in order to ride out the storm. A block or two to the north in Thornhill, a weather watcher emptied her rain gauge at 175 mm. Around the city, torrential rains snarled traffic and stranded drivers. Fire services responded to more than 1,000 calls. In one dramatic scene, marine services personnel rescued four people who fell into the fast-moving currents of the Don River.
An early tally found that there were over 15,000 insurance claims submitted for sewer backups caused by torrential rains and for structural wind damage. Not included in the insured losses were enormous infrastructure damages across the city. For example, about 30 m of Finch Avenue West was washed out. Repairs had still not been completed by the end of the year.""" ;

<http://www.edmtunes.com/2016/01/ultra-music-festival-2016-is-sold-out/> dct:description """Either festival marketers are really slick or supply and demand for festivals has hit the sweet spot in America. In the past few months Dreamstate sold out its first event in amazing time. Then we told you that Electric Forest sold out nearly 6 months in advance. You probably already know that Tomorrowland sells out fast and EDC Vegas often sells out without announcing a single artist from its lineup. Now, for the first time since 2013 Ultra Music Festival in Miami has sold out months in advance as well.
It would appear that the internet buzz from last year’s event combined with the lowering of ticket prices to create the perfect balance of supply and demand for Ultra. We don’t even have phases 2 or 3 of the lineup yet, but you can be sure the buzz around Ultra Miami will be sky high over the next 2 months. So far, Pendulum, Eric Prydz, Avicii, The Prodigy, Kaskade and many more have been confirmed. If you slept on it again this year expecting an easy last minute buy, your only official option is a VIP ticket.""" ;

It moved through eastern Sydney and up to the northern peninsula with damage recorded as far north as Palm Beach.
A fisherman, 45, died in his aluminium boat when struck by lightning 100m offshore at Dolans Bay in Sydney's south. Lightning also struck a factory at Orica starting a fire. At Bundeena, residents reported a 50cm build-up of hail on the roadway.
Major hail damage occurred across 85 suburbs with building windows, roofs and skylights extensively damaged, and thousands of reports of damaged car windscreens and panel damage. Worst-affected areas included the south-east suburbs of Kensington, Kingsford, Botany, Mascot, Randwick and Paddington in Sydney's east.
The figure of 130,000 people affected was based on the approximately 22,000 insured homes (plus uninsured), 2,800 commercial and industrial buildings (plus uninsured), 63,000 cars (plus uninsured), over 60 boats and numerous caravans and miscellaneous items damaged (noting that some people had both house and cars etc damaged). In many homes carpets and furniture were ruined through water damage caused either during the storm or by subsequent rainfall.
Hail size: The largest official recorded size was 9cm (measured in Surry Hills); various reports ranged in size from cricket ball to much larger; and an EMA staff member reported seeing isolated hailstones up to grapefruit size and there were at least two reports of rock melon size as a result of a Macquarie University survey.
The storm produced gales gusting up to 85km/h at Bellambi, south of Sydney. At Sydney Airport, hail caused damage to 23 aircraft and a number of hangars etc with initial insurance estimates exceeding $100m alone.
Sydney's northern beaches also received storm damage, with smashed windows, tiles and extensive flooding at two retirement centres at Collaroy Plateau. Two people working at a Collaroy Plateau hair salon escaped serious injury when part of the shop's roof collapsed. The shop was inundated with water.
Factories were flooded at Dee Why and Brookvale causing water damage to machinery. A Brookvale car yard was flooded after a pipe burst under the pressure of stormwater.
Approximately 200,000 tarpaulins (worth $10m), 9,600km of rope and 280,000 sandbags were fitted to roofs of buildings as a temporary repair measure by almost 15,000 volunteers & emergency workers over the period of the emergency response operation which lasted for over a month. Over $2m was spent on hire of hardware tools and equipment and estimates put the total number of tiles requiring replacement at 20,000,000.
It took many months before all damaged houses were repaired (particularly where uninsured). Delays with claims and shortages of materials (especially roof tiles) and skilled labour, meant thousands of homes remained protected from the elements only by tarpaulins which had to be adjusted, refitted or even replaced each time high winds and storms occurred in the months that followed the disaster.""" ;

The storm tracked across Sydney from the south-western suburbs to the eastern suburbs, resulting in widespread damage. In some cases hail was found in solid lumps up to 1.8 kg and many individual stones were larger than cricket balls. Great damage was caused to house roofs (5000 in Waverley Municipality alone), windows and cars. At least 1000 people were injured (350 requiring medical treatment), many of them caught on beaches in only swimming suits." ;

Created by UMF Films and Charly Friedrichs’ FINAL KID team, this latest offering, shot in 4K, is yet another departure from the standard aftermovie format, capturing the pure essence and magic of Ultra Music Festival’s seventeenth annual edition at Bayfront Park in March of this year.
Immersing fans deeper into the action than ever before and providing the viewer with the most honest insight into the Ultra Music Festival experience to date, Charly’s work is wholly representative of ULTRA’s musical evolution and demonstrates precisely what fans can expect, come March 2016.
With an electrifying new soundtrack offering something different to the classic main stage sound, Charly’s unique vision for this aftermovie takes listeners on a diverse musical journey and into unchartered waters. Showcasing the vast range of genres and styles now on offer at ULTRA, the aftermovie’s exquisitely crafted tracklist really does deliver something special for everybody. From the deeper grooves of HI-LO and Josh Philips, to the high-octane sounds of Skrillex and Valentino Khan, the 14-minute masterpiece concludes with a brand new exclusive from ULTRA favourite and man-of-the-moment, Martin Garrix.
“When I planned on shooting this Miami aftermovie I knew I wanted to create a megamix again. The last Miami aftermovie was created as a short film with one custom soundtrack and a lot of story and slow-motion shots in it, but this time I felt like doing a faster one with a lot of new techniques, visual FX and editing tricks. Most of all I wanted to 'bring back the groove' so I created a soundtrack that has more flow. I want the viewer to be more 'inside' the festival, where people are dancing and not necessarily focused on the DJ. So it's a bit different, but I'm very happy with how it turned out, and of course I'm not leaving the lovers of the epic emotional shots with empty hands because none other than Martin Garrix provided me with an amazing and exclusive melodic track for the Grand Finale!” – Charly Friedrichs, Final Kid
Visually stunning in every sense, the 2015 aftermovie for The World’s Premiere Electronic Music Festival also sees the debut of ULTRA’s brand new RESISTANCE concept. Taking the form of an immersive 360° ‘Afterburner’ stage powered by Arcadia Spectacular, welcoming some of the biggest names in the house and techno world, this piece of audio-visual genius takes us right to the front row of the RESISTANCE Stage to showcase a completely different facet of Ultra Music Festival.
As Ultra Worldwide’s 2015 global journey comes to a close, with a staggering 19 shows across 5 continents clocked in less than a year, all eyes are now focused on the eighteenth annual edition of the Miami flagship in March 2016. For those that want to experience the action first hand, tickets for Ultra Music Festival 2016 are now on sale.

Winter Storm
Summary
The first major snowstorm of the 2007-08 Winter season for Vermont and northern New York, actually occurred prior to the Winter Solstice (December 22nd 108 am EST). Snowfall totals from this pre-winter storm ranged from 6 to 12 inches in southern Vermont, where a prolonged period of sleet and/or freezing rain occurred, to a rather uniform 12 to 18 inches across the rest of Vermont and northern New York (detailed snow amounts available here).
On Saturday morning (15th), a strong and unseasonably cold high pressure system was located across northern New England and southeast Canada. Meanwhile, low pressure was developing across eastern Texas. This area of low pressure gradually strengthened and incorporated abundant moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, as it traveled to the Mississippi and western Ohio River Valleys by Saturday night. During Saturday night and early Sunday morning (16th), this primary low would continue to strengthen in the Ohio River Valley, while a coastal low would gradually develop along the mid-Atlantic coast, due to a strong, coupled upper-level jet stream as well as a deepening mid-atmospheric trough.
Snow began to overspread New York and Vermont early Sunday morning (16th) with snowfall rates rapidly increasing to over an inch per hour. The Ohio river valley storm maintained its strength during Sunday as it moved into the eastern Great Lakes, this allowed milder air aloft (4000-8000 feet) to move into the North Country, as well as drier air to be incorporated into the storm. These two factors caused precipitation to fall as a wintry mix (snow, sleet and freezing rain), as well as developed a lull in intensity of precipitation during the mid-late morning hours that lasted until mid-late afternoon. However, by late Sunday afternoon and continuing through Sunday evening, the secondary coastal storm intensified and this allowed the second part of this winter storm to wrap accumulating snow into northern New York and Vermont, as well as provided brisk winds that caused considerable blowing snow.
Although each winter storm is different in many ways...the same general characteristics are often very similar for major snowstorms in the North Country (Vermont and northern New York) and this storm exhibited these characteristics;
A strong and sometimes "coupled" upper atmospheric jet stream
A deepening long wave trough along with a strengthening, negatively-tilted short wave
A strong temperature gradient from south to north and coastal vs. inland (Surface, 850mb, 700 mb)
An abundant moisture supply (Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic)
Surface low pressure track between Boston and outer Cape Cod, Massachusetts

The storm only produced precipitation for 8 or 9 hours, but packed a whollop. See the reports below for the snow (and sleet) accumulations. Snow was deepest over the North, with Sleet the predominant precipitation type in the central third of the state. Freezing rain fell across the southern third to half of the state, accumulating up to a third of an inch on trees, power lines, and untreated surfaces, but turned to plain rain later in the storm. The heavy sleet and ice caused a few power outages.

An open call for songs has been launched by RTVSLO, the Slovenian broadcaster for the country's preselection for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. Interested parties will have to submit their bids by 14th December. Songs have to be in Slovenian but it is not specified in the rules whether foreign composers will be accepted or not this year.
A specially appointed jury will shortlist fourteen songs which will compete live in the EMA 2010 semi final, called EMA Predizbor. The finalists will then be joined in the EMA Izbor by more songs which will be submitted by prominent local composers invited by the broadcaster. RTVSLO will be inviting a total of seven composers increasing the number of six they invited for EMA 2009.
Slovenia have still to beat their best placing which was in 1999 and 2001, when Daria Svaiger and Nusa Derenda came 7th. Since the introduction of the semi final in 2004, Slovenia have only managed to qualify once in 2007 with Alenka Gotar's Cvet z juga. In 2009, Slovenia was represented by Quartissimo ft Martina Majerle who placed 16th in the semi final.
Very special thanks to Primoz Poglajen Medeiros for the information.""" ;

The competition will take place in the first fortnight of March, although the exact dates have not been yet announced. A total of 14 entries will compete and invited artists will feature as well.
As esctoday.com announced back in October, the 2010 Slovenian national selection will see two important novelties: the outcome of the competition will be the result of a 100% televote for the first time, unlike in previous years. Moreover, the song that will represent the country in Oslo will be sung in Slovene.
The public will find out about that entry in the first half of March 2010, when EMA is scheduled to take place. The exact dates have not been issued yet. A total of 14 songs will be performed and seven invited artists, selected by a jury, will take part in the competition as well.

<http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14645> dct:description """Slovenian broadcaster RTVSLO has just announced the entries competing for the ticket to Oslo at EMA 2010, the Slovenian preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Out of 111 submitted entries, an internal expert jury consisting of Mojca Menart, Urška Cop, Andrea Flego, Miha Vardjan and Drago Mislej has selected 14 songs.
Nina Pušlar - Dež Martina Šraj - Dovolj Ljubezni Zadnji Taxi - Franjo Vaso & D Plejbeks - Gremo na emo Petra Pečovnik - Iz Nevade Martina Feri - Le en dan Maro Vozelj - Maj si zrak Anz.

In alphabetical order by song titles, these are the 14 entries:
In case of a withdrawal of one or more of the 14 selected tracks mentioned above, the following seven entries are eligible to compete:
Zala Hodnik - Ptice v letu Samuel Lucas - Na pravi poti Andrej Ikica - Ko mine ta dan Sons - 3 stvari Kata Fašink in Rok Ferengja - Nova Pomlad Sebastian - Bodi ob meni Skupina Suplenca - Gremo ven
Apart from some newcomers, there are also some well known faces to the Eurovision world fighting for victory, among them Brigita Šuler, who was in the 2009 final with her song Druga liga, as well as in the 2008 final, where she came 3rd with her dramatic song about the godess Samara.
The most popular names are Manca Špik and the group Langa, who together participated at EMA 2009 with the ethno song Zaigraj muzikant and won the televoting by a landslide but ended up in 5th place due to the fact that they did not receive a single point from the jury. This scenario will be impossible in 2010, as the altered rules include the method of 100% televoting to determine the winner. This time, Manca and Langa give it another try on their own.
An exact date for the Slovenian national final has not been set yet, however, it has been announced that it will take place in the first half of March.

<http://www.euronews.com/2015/02/02/thailand-steps-up-security-in-bangkok-after-bomb-blasts-at-luxury-mall/> dct:description """Thailand has stepped up security in Bangkok after two small bombs exploded at a luxury mall in the capital overnight on Sunday.
This could be the beginning of signs of resentment that will eventually take various forms.
Two people suffered minor injuries. Though no one has claimed responsibility, the circumstances lead police to believe the motive was to create panic rather than take lives.
National Police Chief Somyot Pumpanmuang said, “From the location and material of the bombs, they were not designed to injure or kill anyone. They were designed for threatening and creating chaos.”
The blasts were the first to hit the capital living under martial law since a military coup in May.
“In my opinion, this could be the beginning of signs of resentment that will eventually take various forms,” said one Bangkok resident.
Tensions have been running especially high since last month when the army approved parliament banned former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from politics for five years.
The decision angered her supporters, but so far there has been no return to the often violent street protests witnessed last year. After the latest blasts it’s unlikely martial law will be lifted anytime soon, despite international pressure to lift the measure.""" ;

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu says security measures along the border with Syria will be increased. But he also warned that Turkey’s internal security could be compromised by the spillover of conflict from neighbouring countries.

The sustainability initiative, Festival Vision: 2025, launched the second edition of its pioneering Show Must Go On Report at the UK Festival Awards on December 5th.
The document outlines the environmental impact of the festival industry and acts as a definitive guide for live events wishing to limit their carbon footprint. Following a highly successful crowdfunding campaign earlier this year, the 2019 iteration of the Report brings its contents up-to-date with current information and best practice.
See below for the launch video.
The report states that: “As festival organisers we know how to create unforgettable experiences and how to inspire people. We know how to get things done in challenging circumstances and we are accomplished at communicating with audiences.
"It is well within our reach to turn our industry into an exemplar of environmental responsibility. We can make a vital and significant contribution to a future that we want our children to inherit.
"Festival organisers working with their many and diverse partners, from concessions to the supply chain, contractors, charities and brands, can provide leadership for what is perhaps the most important conversation of our time.”""" ;

Dec. 4: Jerry Morgan falls into the flood waters as he arrives at higher ground after he was rescued from his home in Centralia, Wash.
Dec. 4: An aerial view of the flooding in Centralia, Wash.
The drenching rains and howling winds were gone but flooding concerns persisted Wednesday, as anxious residents waited for waters to recede so they could see what was left after this week's fierce storm.
The storm, which killed at least seven people as it battered the Pacific Northwest before moving on Tuesday, left behind flooded homes, fallen trees and washed-out roads, including the region's largest highway. On Wednesday, the storm continued pushing east, dumping snow across the Midwest.
Some were spending Wednesday looking for the lost. In the Lewis County town of Winlock, a dive team planned to search normally tiny Wallers Creek for Richard Hiatt, 81, believed to have been swept away when a bank gave out from underneath him.
"It happened so quickly," daughter-in-law Sharon Hiatt said Tuesday as searches continued. "That's the only possibility, that he fell into the creek."
In many coastal areas, lights were slowly coming back on Wednesday morning, said Aberdeen police Detective George J. Kelly, a spokesman at the Grays Harbor County emergency command center.
Kelly couldn't provide exact numbers, but said at least half of downtown Aberdeen had electricity and Grays Harbor Community Hospital no longer had to rely on emergency generators. Tens of thousands were without power in Oregon and Washington state at the height of the storm.
National Guard troops were summoned early Wednesday morning to help evacuate a 20-unit trailer park near Elma threatened by the flooding Chehalis River, Kelly said.
Floodwaters about 90 miles west of Seattle were also approaching U.S. Highway 12, a principal link to the Puget Sound area, Kelly said.
As the water started to rise outside their Lewis County home, Terry Roberts moved his cars to higher ground, shepherded his wife and two children into their RV and hit the road.
They didn't get far.
"We were on dry road and all of a sudden, the water started swirling around," Roberts said, standing with his wife in a temporary shelter in Chehalis after being rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter. "That's when we got on the CB and called for help."
Roberts, 64, was among the hundreds who fled their homes after the storm.
Gov. Chris Gregoire, who toured the ravaged region by helicopter Tuesday, touched down at a high school shelter in Chehalis and offered encouragement to the roughly 40 people staying there.
She also ordered a plane to deliver food and emergency supplies to the high school in Pe Ell, about 25 miles to the west, because the roads were blocked by water.
"It's hard to comprehend 5- to 10-feet under until you see those houses," Gregoire said.
The governor also flew to the water's edge on Interstate 5, which has been shut down since Monday at Centralia because of flooding. At one point Tuesday, officials said a three-mile section of the road was under as much as 10 feet of water from the surging Chehalis River.
The interstate, which is the main north-south route between Portland, Ore., and Seattle, was expected to be closed at least through Thursday.
In Tillamook, Ore., home to large dairy cattle herds, the smell of manure was pervasive as shopkeepers downtown shoveled out their businesses. At the Wilson River RV Park, one vehicle was on its side, and others were in mud 6 inches to 8 inches deep.
Ben and Amanda Beal had moved to a motel with their two young children when police notified everyone there to evacuate. Just as they left the parking lot, waves swelled over Highway 101.
"I thought we were going to be swept away," said Amanda Beal. "You could feel the water pushing the Blazer. The winds were blowing at 100 miles per hour."
"We just panicked," Ben Beal said.
With I-5 closed, state officials were recommending a lengthy detour — Interstate 90 across the Cascade mountains and down U.S. 97 through central Washington to the Oregon border — a route that roughly doubles the three-hour trip from Seattle to Portland.
David Dye, Washington state's deputy transportation secretary, said workers were cleaning up lots of debris — "garbage, tires, dead rats everywhere" — while they waited for the water to recede.
On the edge of downtown Centralia, waist-high water the color of chocolate milk covered streets as police used small boats to get to houses in flooded neighborhoods.
More than 300 people had to be rescued in Lewis County, many being plucked off their rooftops by helicopter, Sheriff Steve Mansfield said.
Chehalis City Manager Merlin MacReynold said between 70 and 80 people had to be rescued in the city limits alone. He called the flooding worse than the 1996 deluge, which is still legendary in the area.
The storm overwhelmed a number of sewage treatment plants, allowing tons of raw sewage to spew into Puget Sound.
Mudslides halted Amtrak passenger train service between Portland and Vancouver, British Columbia, at least through Wednesday.
The storm moved out to the Upper Midwest, where it dumped as much of 9 inches of snow in parts of North Dakota and two people died in a weather-related car accidents in Wisconsin. Western Ohio was predicted to get as much as 7 inches of snow.
The snow closed Milwaukee's airport and created delays and cancellations at several other midwestern airports, including Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and caused a bus crash in Indiana that injured 17 people, authorities said.
Crews hoped to have at least one runway open at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee by midmorning, airport spokeswoman Pat Rowe said.""" ;

The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) militant group on Thursday claimed responsibility for Sunday’s suicide bombing in the Turkish capital Ankara that killed 37 people, and vowed to continue its strikes against security forces.

Separately, Germany said it had closed its embassy in Ankara due to indications that an attack could be imminent. The consulate and German school in Istanbul were also closed, it said.
TAK had previously claimed responsibility for a car bombing in Ankara last month that killed 29 people. Ankara has now been hit by three bombings in a space of five months, ratcheting up security fears across the city and Turkey.
In a statement posted online, the group described the car bombing, which occurred on Sunday, as revenge for security operations in the mainly Kurdish southeast that have been under way since July, in which hundreds of civilians, security forces and militants have been killed.
"We claim the operation of March 13, 2016 at 6.45pm in the heart of the Republic of Turkey," TAK said in a statement posted on its website Thursday, adding that, “We have hundreds of members ready to conduct suicide attacks."
The group said the attack was led by Seher Cagla Demir, code name Doga Jiyan, described as the first female suicide bomber in its ranks.
The name in the claim of responsibility corresponds with the findings of Turkey's Interior Ministry, which on Tuesday identified the suicide car bomber as a 24-year-old woman who became a Kurdish rebel in 2013 and had trained in Syria.
Out of PKK's shadows
A shadowy new Kurdish group, TAK says it split from the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). According to Jasper Mortimer, FRANCE 24’s correspondent in Turkey, “It’s affiliated to the PKK, but it enjoys a certain operational autonomy.”

Mortimer noted that most experts say the TAK is trained and financed by the PKK. “The PKK lays down the guidelines for the type of targets TAK can pursue. But TAK itself would choose the specific target,” said Mortimer.
Sunday’s bombing at a bus stop in Ankara’s Kizilay neighbourhood occurred around 10 to 20 metres away from a police post, Mortimer noted. “But morally that holds no water because there were scores of civilians at that bus terminus.”
A return to the dark days of the 1990s?
The Kizilay bombing was the latest in a series of attacks in Turkey over the past few months that have been blamed on either Kurdish rebels or the Islamic State (IS) group.
In addition to the IS group threat, Turkey is also confronting increased violence in the Kurdish-dominated southeastern part of the country following the collapse of the Kurdish peace process and Ankara’s insistence that Syrian Kurdish groups – who are leading the anti-IS fight – represent a threat to the Turkish state.
“Overall this is bad news for Turkey,” said Mortimer. “It will hurt the pro-Kurdish party in parliament, the HDP, five leading members of which, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is campaigning to have thrown out of parliament, accusing them of terrorist links.”
The HDP is the first pro-Kurdish political party to have secured more than the 10 percent of a general election vote required to make it into the country’s parliament.
Critics have accused Erdogan of abandoning the Kurdish peace process, which held for several years, in a bid to crush the leftist, pro-Kurdish opposition HDP party.
In the southeastern parts of the country, where Turkish security forces are clamping down on Kurdish groups, there are fears of a return to the brutal 1990s, when the PKK staged an armed insurgency against the Turkish state which in turn brutally crushed the Kurds.
Reporting from Ankara, FRANCE 24’s Mortimer said Sunday’s attack “recalls the dark days of the Kurdish insurgency in the 1990s, when the PKK was detonating bombs in public places. That gave birth to a secret organisation run by the Turkish army called JITEM, which went around detaining people from their houses in the middle of the night, killing them and then burying them secretly,” said Mortimer. “In other words, Kurdish terrorism provoked state terrorism and that magnified the number of innocent people that were being killed.”

FISHING TUG GOES DOWN IN A FIERCE GALE.
Harbor Beach, Mich., April 25. -- All hope for the safety of the fishing tug Searchlight, which was struck by the furious northwest gale off this port on Tuesday night, has been abandoned. Life savers, who have been searching for the missing craft, returned to port with pieces of wreckage they had picked up in Lake Huron bearing the name of the steamer. They also brought back seventeen more fish boxes which the craft had on board.
The last heard of the Searchlight was when she left the fishing ground in Lake Huron off this point, and started to return to port Tuesday night.
When the boat failed to reach port, the lifesavers with a government tug, set out in search. After patrolling the lake for many hours, they returned to port, having found nothing but some fish boxes five miles south of the point where the Searchlight was last sighted by the lookout at the life-saving station.
The missing crew are:
WALTER BROWN, captain, Harbor Beach.
HARRY BROWN, mate, Harbor Beach.
EDWARD COVEAU, engineer, Bay City.
MERTON PERKINS, fireman, Harbor Beach.
JOHN LESTER, deckhand, Harbor Beach.

For days, a massive storm had been brewing in the Caribbean. Swirling slowly on a northerly course, it had drenched Cuba but posed no danger - it seemed - to the prosperous city 50 miles south of Houston.
Now, just after midday on Sept. 8, 1900, it had reached the island. Sea spilled into streets, debris floated past buildings, a black and crimson storm flag whipped in the surging wind.
At the telegraph office, Cline learned that only one phone line to the mainland still worked - and 4,000 calls waited in a queue. He wrangled his way ahead of the others and sent a message warning of an "awful disaster."
Moments later, that phone line, too, went dead.
Even in the midst of chaos, Cline was careful to encipher his cable. He did not want news of the calamity about to beset Galveston to spread through Houston. At least, not yet.
The two places were then locked in a battle to be the greatest city in Texas. One of the greatest in the country.
More Information By the numbers Death toll: 6,000-12,000 Homes destroyed: 3,600 Storm surge: 15.7 feet Highest elevation on the island: 8.7 feet Estimated damages in 1900 dollars: $21 million
Read More
The Storm of 1900 would forever tip that balance, halting the progress of one city and clearing the path for the ascent of the other.
****
At the dawn of the 20th century, Galveston was a bustling center of commerce, culture and concentrated wealth. The second-largest port on the Gulf coast and the third-largest city in Texas. The first in the state to have electricity and telephones.
The 27-mile-long island was home to 35 churches, 30 hotels, 484 saloons, 50 brothels and 45 steamship lines. It boasted the biggest opera house in Texas; a lyceum where Galvestonians would gather for lectures; Greek Revival, Romanesque and Italianate mansions; and a downtown known as the "Wall Street of the Southwest."
According to "Isaac's Storm" by Erik Larson, the city was home to more millionaires per square mile than Newport, R.I.
It was a city on the rise. With Houston close behind.
The census of 1900 showed Houston's population at 44,633 - for the first time, outpacing Galveston, which had 37,789 residents. Houston, limited as a port city by its inland location, had a near-monopoly on the railroads fast becoming the best way to transport goods. As a result, it had become a transportation hub for cotton crops from the Brazos River Valley.
The city on the Buffalo Bayou also wanted to compete with Galveston as a major port.
During the 1890s, U.S.Rep. Tom Ball fought to convince Congress to dredge Houston's ship channel to a 25-foot depth. But those efforts were blocked in Congress and opposed by the Corps of Engineers, which maintained that Galveston Harbor was enough to serve the region.
The "awful disaster" of Sept. 8 would change that.
B B B
By 6 p.m. that day, the worst of the storm was battering Galveston.
Survivors described an island in utter darkness as angry winds of up to 140 mph lashed the shoreline, reduced the clapboard houses closest to the sea to rubble and hurled slate roof tiles through the air like projectiles. Galvestonians huddled for shelter in brick and stone buildings like the Ursuline Convent and the Tremont Hotel, which each housed 1,000 refugees. Another 400 hunkered down in city hall. Those structures and the bulk of the affluent "Silk Stocking" district survived; working-class neighborhoods were ravaged.
Luisa Rolfing rode the storm out with her family of five in her brother-in-law's house. Her account describes the water swirling up over the ceiling of the first floor and the piano skittering across the room as the house lurched back and forth. "It sounded as if the rooms were filled with a thousand little devils, shrieking and whistling," she later wrote.
A 15-foot surge of water wrought the greatest destruction as it swamped the island, whose highest point measured all of 8.7 feet above sea level.
The rush of water uprooted a train trestle and flung it through the home of Isaac Cline, Joseph's brother and the chief meteorologist in the Galveston office of the U.S. Weather Bureau. Fifty people, along with Isaac Cline's pregnant wife, their three daughters and Joseph, had sought shelter there.
The house was knocked off its foundation, tossing the inhabitants into the roiling water. Cline found his brother and three young children clinging to wreckage, but 18 others - including his wife - did not survive.
At St. Mary's Catholic Orphan Asylum, on the west end of the island, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word tried to save the orphans by tying them with cinctures so they would not float away. The asylum was destroyed, and all 10 nuns and 90 children died. Three teenage boys, who survived by clinging to a floating tree, were rescued after two days.
Dawn revealed a devastated island: Thousands dead, scores missing, the physical and psychological landscape of Galveston forever altered.
B B B
In the aftermath, there were stories of heroism, resilience and rebirth.
Daniel Ransom, an African-American paper hanger who lived near the sea, saved 45 people during the storm, diving into the thrashing water to pull them out of harm's way.
At Ursuline Convent, four women gave birth during the storm, including one who was pulled into the convent after being thrown from her home onto a floating trunk.
Six survivors - two journalists, two brokers, a contractor and an engineer - commandeered a 20-foot launch and made it to the mainland, where a relief effort was already underway in Houston. That city soon sent 250 men, 100,000 gallons of fresh water and two boxcars of food.
Other assistance came from across the country, including the arrival of Clara Barton and her Red Cross workers. U.S. troops were sent in to establish martial law. The War Department distributed rations and tents.
For weeks, about 200 families left homeless camped out on the beach. The bodies of those killed in the storm were burned in funeral pyres on the sand.
It would take more than a decade for the city to rebuild.
A decade in which two forces combined to push Houston to prominence.
In 1901, oil was discovered at Spindletop, near Beaumont - marking the birth of the industry that would fuel Houston's future.
In 1914, the Houston Ship Channel was completed, a project that had gained support after Galveston was flattened, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
"The hurricane made the logic of an inland port on the Texas Gulf Coast clear to all," the report concluded.
The rivalry, it seemed, was over. Houston had won.""" ;

<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/byron-smith-audio_n_5255546.html> dct:description """A Minnesota court has released audio from the night Byron Smith shot and killed two teenage cousins who had broken into his home.
Smith was convicted on Tuesday of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for killing 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer in his basement. The audio Smith made of the Thanksgiving 2012 slayings can be heard below and might be upsetting to some.
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A window shatters. The sound of footsteps is followed by sharp cracks of gunshots, a teenager's groans and a fall. Minutes later, there are more bangs and screams from another teen before she, too, was silenced by a central Minnesota homeowner who was convicted of plotting the whole thing.
A day after Byron Smith was found guilty of premeditated murder, jurors said the audio of the Thanksgiving Day 2012 killings of two unarmed teens — a recording that the 65-year-old switched on before the break-in occurred — was key in his conviction.
"That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said Wednesday. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."
Smith shot 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer as they descended the stairs into his basement, where prosecutors say Smith was waiting. Prosecutors say Smith had moved his truck to make it look like no one was home, then sat in a chair at the bottom of his stairs with a book, energy bars, a bottle of water and two guns. He also set up a hand-held recorder on a bookshelf.
Defense attorneys said Smith was afraid after prior break-ins and was hiding from intruders, whom he feared were armed. Smith had previously installed video surveillance, and defense attorney Steve Meshbesher said Wednesday that Smith set up the audio recording as another means of protection.
"He was afraid that he might be killed," Meshbesher said. "He did it in case he was shot and killed in his house, and the police would have some evidence to use, and the family would be able to find the perpetrators."
Meshbesher said jurors should have heard the whole recording, not just the portion selected by prosecutors. He said Smith plans to appeal.
Ted Sampsell-Jones, a criminal law professor at William Mitchell College of Law, said the audio recording was devastating to the defense, noting that Smith's taunts to the victims don't show a man in a panic.
"It was very powerful, and it makes it very clear that ... he didn't do this because he had to. He did it because he wanted to. And that is not what self-defense is about," Sampsell-Jones said.
The recording captured the sounds of Smith shooting Brady as he came down the stairs. Brady groans after the first and second shots, but is silent after a third shot, and Smith can be heard saying, "You're dead."
Prosecutors say Smith put Brady's body on a tarp and dragged it into another room, then sat down and reloaded his weapon.
Kifer whispers, "Nick?" A shot is fired, and Kifer screams. Smith apologizes as his gun jams, then fires at Kifer four more times and says: "You're dying." A sixth and final shot — Smith described it as a "finishing shot" to investigators — was heard soon after.
Hatlestad said he felt early on in the trial that the killings were planned. He said the fact that Smith moved his truck from his home was significant, and he was struck that Smith positioned himself at the bottom of the stairs in "a little hidey hole," with a tarp ready.
He said jurors went through each charge point by point, "and reasonably quickly came to the conclusion that we thought it was in fact premeditated," Hatlestad said. He said jurors talked about the "deer stand" that Smith set up to wait for the teens, and he also compared the set up to a "shooting gallery" — a carnival game where a shooter waits for an object to march into view.
The teens' killings stirred debate around the state and in Little Falls — a Mississippi River city of 8,000 about 100 miles northwest of Minneapolis — about how far a homeowner can go in responding to a threat. Minnesota law allows deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but one's actions must be considered reasonable under the circumstances.
Hatlestad said jurors gave careful consideration to the self-defense and defense-of-dwelling claims. He said the jurors supported Minnesota's laws, but found that Smith's actions didn't meet the requirements to justify the teens' killings.""" ;

Lauderdale Airport, traffic all over Miami, overbooked cab companies) over 150,000 enthusiastic fans made their way to Bicentennial Park on Friday for the 13th annual Ultra Music Festival. It was hot, it was packed and the schedule was chaotic, yet fans banded together for one simple reason: to dance the days away to one of the best electronic music lineups ever put together.
What once started as a small party on the beach in 1999 is now the world's biggest dance music festival, encompassing three days, eight stages and more than 200 musicians, evidence that the electronic dance music craze has exploded into a full blown pop-culture revolution here in the United States.
The sold out show -- 150,000 tickets sold -- rivals last year's Coachella Music Festival in numbers, which features a variety of music for all different tastes. But the singular focus of electronic music is found nowhere else as great as Ultra, where acts like Tiesto, Kaskade, David Guetta and Moby are revered like big name celebrities. According to the Wall Street Journal, last year Tiesto, who has yet to have a radio hit or best selling album, made over $20 million; he has 376,707 followers on twitter, and is easily recognized in person. It is no doubt that Tiesto is just one example of the new, and much more socially inclined, "rock stars" taking over the hearts and minds of a younger generation.
Ultra Music Festival 2011
Ultra Music Festival 2011
1 of 22 Fans screamed as Carl Cox took to the stage. Share this slide:
And there were some real rock stars present. Duran Duran performed on Friday night, yet more ravers were crowded around the Loco Dice performance. Similarly, P. Diddy collaborated with Erick Morillo and Flo.rida and Will.i.am joined David Guetta on stage, but ATB and MSTRKRFT pulled in large numbers of fans on the other stages. Though the disco revivalists and hip-hop artists present may add some cache to the otherwise strictly electronic fest, traditional pop music PR just doesn't cut it with this passionate crowd. The come for the dubstep, they come for the house, they come for the electronica... and that is exactly what they get.
Like last year, Carl Cox & Friends had a dedicated tent with two VIP sections, a second story platform and Cirque de Soleil-esque lighting and design effects. The tent was one of the most aerodynamic, brilliantly built stages ever resurrected at a festival. Fans exclaimed at how comfortable it was (full-flooring), how much space there was to move (despite being packed throughout the entire 3 days) and how much they appreciated the thought that went into the architecture of the stage. On Sunday, Armin Van Buuren took over for the 500th episode of A State of Trance and broadcasted the smoke covered show all over European radio stations.
Ultra Music Festival is not for the faint of feet. It's an intense three days, one that can borderline on dangerous. The crowd is very young, drug use is clearly apparent and injuries and heat exhaustion are numerous. But at the heart of it, Ultra is a time to come together with friends and simply dance. Afrojack, Aoki, Deadmau5 -- their music captures the zeitgeist of a new generation: a generation who, in the last few years, have faced an increasingly rigorous and diminished job market, a prevalent war culture and financial instability. And how do they react? They tweet, they 'like' and then they dance. They just dance.

Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan has sent a letter of condolence to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, following a suicide bombing in southeastern Turkey that killed 32 people and wounded nearly 100 on July 20.“It was with deep sorrow that I learned of the explosion in the town of Suruç in Turkey’s Şanlıurfa province that killed a few dozen people. We strongly condemn all manifestations of terrorism,” Sargsyan said in his letter which was posted on the official site of the President of the Republic of Armenia on July 20.“Please, accept my condolences on the incident. I wish steadfastness and strength of spirit to the victims’ relatives and a speedy recovery to the injured,” said Sargsyan.The two estranged neighbors do not have diplomatic relations, and Ankara closed its border with Yerevan in 1993 because of its war with Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.A now-stalled rapprochement process between the two countries began in 2008. In October 2009, Armenian and Turkish officials initiated protocols to normalize relations between the two countries, but the documents have not been ratified since then and have faced immense criticism in both countries.The protocols, which call for the establishment of diplomatic ties and the reopening of the shared border, also called for a joint commission to examine the two countries’ shared history. Armenia recognizes the mass killings of Anatolian Armenians in the Ottoman era in 1915 as “genocide” – a label fiercely rejected by Turkey.

A Bangkok court issued an arrest warrant for a man in a yellow T-shirt, who police say is a foreigner, according to a Times report.
Investigators are focusing their efforts on budget Bangkokhotels in the Sathorn Road area where they believe the suspect stayed. Motorbikers and tuk-tuk (motorised pedicab) drivers who dropped off and picked up the man before and after the bomb blast have been questioned by police, according to The Australian.
Police quizzed staff at the Niagara Hotel and also copied the guest records. The hotel is next to the motorcycle taxi rank where two drivers say they gave several lifts to a man resembling the alleged bomber earlier this year.
"The police told me the reason they have been coming here so much is because the suspect was staying round here, and even staying in this hotel before the incident," said a member of staff at the Niagara. "They said that he came into this area. I didn't recognise him from the pictures, but we see so many different guests here," he said in a Times report.
Security camera footage also shows the suspect on a road called Sathorn Sai 10, which is near the Niagara. Police have also shown potential witnesses film of the man in a shop, reportedly before the bombing. He is wearing a long-sleeved blue shirt, rather than a yellow T-shirt.

Deputy national police chief Pol Gen Somyot Pumpunmuang said police have obtained evidence suggesting the bombing involved several people surveying the site and the route in advance, acquiring components to make the bomb, and planning an escape. The number of those involved in the attack could number more than 10 people working as a "well-organised team", national police chief Somyot Pumpunmuang said
"Based on discussions with international experts it appears this incident probably involved a big network of more than 10 perpetrators," Pol Gen Somyot said. "And based on evidence and witness accounts, they surveyed the area several times and planned an escape route to get out of Bangkok to avoid getting noticed by authorities. They worked as a team."
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing in what is Thailand's worst single mass casualty attack in living memory. The potential perpetrators named by police and experts include international jihadists, members of Thailand's southern Malay-Muslim insurgency, China's Uighur minority, militants on both sides of Thailand's political divide, or an individual with a personal grudge.""" ;

<http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/ankara-car-bomb-kills-at-least-27-people-and-wounds-75-1.2571580> dct:description """A car bomb killed at least 27 people at a crowded transport hub in the Turkish capital of Ankara on Sunday and wounded at least 75 more, the second such attack in the administrative heart of the city in less than a month.
The blast, which could be heard several kilometres away, sent burning debris showering down over an area a few hundred metres from the justice and interior ministries, a top courthouse, and the former office of the prime minister.
Police helicopters hovered overhead as a large cloud of smoke rose over the city centre.
One senior security official told reporters initial findings suggested the attack had been carried out by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) or an affiliated militant group, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The government blamed the PKK and Kurdish militants in Syria for the previous car bombing just a few blocks away on February 17th, which killed 29 people, most of them soldiers.
That attack struck near Turkey’s military headquarters, parliament and other key government institutions.
Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan spoke with interior minister Efkan Ala by telephone after Sunday’s blast, presidential sources said.
“A total of 27 of our citizens were killed when a car exploded at Kizilay’s Guven Park, and close to 75 of our wounded citizens were taken to various hospitals for treatment,” the Ankara governor’s office said in a statement.
A second senior security official said gunfire was heard after the blast.
State broadcaster TRT said the car had exploded at a major transport hub, hitting a bus carrying some 20 people near the central Guven Park and Kizilay Square.
It said the area was crowded when the explosion happened at 6.43pm local time.
Security threats
Nato member Turkey faces multiple security threats.
As part of a US-led coalition, it is fighting Islamic State in neighbouring Syria and Iraq.
It is also battling PKK militants in its southeast, where a 2-and-a-half-year ceasefire collapsed last July, triggering the worst violence since the 1990s.
The US embassy issued a warning on March 11th that there was information regarding a potential attack on government buildings in the Bahcelievler area of Ankara, several kilometres away from the site of Sunday’s blast.
Islamic State militants have carried out at least four bomb attacks on Turkey since June 2015, including a suicide bombing that killed 10 German tourists in the historic heart of Istanbul in January.
Local jihadist groups and leftist radicals have also staged attacks in the Nato member country in the past.

<http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/06/13/national/suspect-may-suffer-from-personality-disorder/#.WVGPNWjyvIU> dct:description """OSAKA — Mamoru Takuma, the suspect in the primary school rampage that claimed the lives of eight pupils in Osaka Prefecture, is suspected by psychiatrists of having paranoid personality disorder, it was revealed Tuesday.
In a previous incident, however, Takuma was diagnosed with schizophrenia, the Japanese Association of Psychiatric Hospitals said.
In general, schizophrenics are not considered criminally responsible for their actions and are not supposed to face charges. People with personality disorders, however, can be found partially responsible for criminal acts.
Considering similar past cases, some psychiatrists believe the attack at the state-run Osaka Kyoiku University Ikeda Elementary School is consistent with someone suffering from a personality disorder.
Takuma, 37, was arrested in March 1999 for allegedly poisoning teachers with tea laced with tranquilizers at a school where he worked as a janitor. He was released after he was deemed not mentally competent to take criminal responsibility and was diagnosed as schizophrenic, according to police. Instead, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and was released a month later.
The difference between the two types of mental illness is subtle, however, and the results of psychiatric tests in court sometimes lead to different conclusions.
The U.S. psychiatric society sorts personality disorders into 10 different types. Many are characterized by inappropriate furious rage, flat emotion, and selfish and reckless acts.
People suffering from paranoid personality disorder tend to harbor delusional distrust of others.
Schizophrenics suffer from hallucinations and frequently make incoherent statements.
In the case of a serial killer who targeted young girls in the Tokyo metropolitan area in 1988 and 1989, the Tokyo District Court sentenced the defendant Tsutomu Miyazaki to death in April 1997.
The court adopted the psychiatrists’ conclusion that Miyazaki had a personality disorder.
Masaaki Noda, a professor of psychopathology at Kyoto Women’s University, said that personality disorders involve character, not illness.
As for Takuma’s school rampage, Noda said, “Since it does not appear that (Takuma’s) thinking is really out of order in this case, it is possible that he is not schizophrenic.”
Takuma stormed into classrooms of the elementary school in Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture, Friday morning, fatally stabbing eight children aged from 6 to 8 with a kitchen knife and injuring 15 others, including two teachers. He was arrested at the scene.""" ;

A male suspect was arrested.
Officials have not given a motivation for the shooting, which also injured several people in La Loche, an impoverished community of fewer than 3,000 people about 600 km (375 miles) north of Saskatoon, the province’s largest city.
“Obviously this is every parent’s worst nightmare,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He was in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum.
Mass shootings are rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the United States.
In the country’s worst shooting incident, 14 college students were killed at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique in 1989. A shooting in 1992 at Concordia University in Montreal killed four.
Friday’s shooting occurred at a high school called the Dene Building.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Maureen Levy said police were also investigating a second location in a nearby residential neighborhood, but provided no further details.
Police took the suspect into custody outside the school and seized a gun. They have not released the identity of the suspect or victims.
Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, which represents more than 70 of the province’s Indian bands, said a few students were in surgery Friday evening in Saskatoon.
A teacher and a teacher’s assistant were among the four killed, Cameron said after talking with community members.
La Loche acting Mayor Kevin Janvier told the Canadian Press the incident may have started at the suspect’s home. “I’m not 100 percent sure what’s actually happened, but it started at home and ended at the school,” Janvier said.
La Loche student Noel Desjarlais told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that he heard multiple shots fired at the school, which has about 900 students.
“I ran outside the school,” Desjarlais said. “There was lots of screaming. There was about six, seven shots before I got outside. I believe there was more shots by the time I did get out.”
A cellphone video taken by one resident and broadcast by CBC showed students walking away from the school and emergency personnel then moving in.
Among Canada’s provinces, Saskatchewan had the highest rate of police-reported family violence in 2014, double the national rate of 243 incidents per 100,000 people.
Unemployment runs above 20 percent in the area, but three-quarters of working-age people are classified as retired or not looking for work, according to 2011 government data. Residents say the real unemployment rate is above 50 percent.
In 2014, a teacher expressed concern about violence at the La Loche school, noting that a student who had tried to stab her was put back in her classroom after serving his sentence, and another attacked her at her home.
“That student got 10 months,” Janice Wilson told the CBC of the student who tried to stab her in class. “And when he was released, he was returned to the school and was put in my classroom.”""" ;

The P.E.I. man is in the city with other Island parents at the under-15 and under-17 Canada Basketball nationals.
Two Fredericton police officers were among the four died in a shooting Friday in a residential area on the city’s north side.
“We’re just up the street from where it happened,’’ MacDonald said. “The Tim Hortons they keep showing on the news is actually the corner where we turn to get up to our Airbnb.
“We knew nothing about it until people starting texting to (ask us) if everything was OK because we’re just kind of taking our morning and having a coffee and sitting around.’’

EUGENE, Ore. - One man died and seven others received non-life-threatening injuries in a two-vehicle crash on icy Highway 126-E about seven miles south of the Highway 20 junction.
State police troopers said around 2 p.m. Saturday, a sport utility vehicle driven by 30-year-old Norman Good of Eugene was heading east on the highway when he lost control on packed snow and slid sideways into the oncoming traffic lane.
An oncoming pickup driven by Antonio Rico-Sanchez of Culver then crashed into the passenger side of the SUV.
Police said the front-seat passenger in the SUV, Joshua Christensen, 28, of Veneta, was pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor who stopped to provide medical care.
Seven other people were sent to a Bend hospital for their injuries, including three children in the SUV and two kids in the pickup.
Troopers said speed was not a factor in the crash. Highway 126 was closed for two hours while state police investigated.""" ;

The two killed at the courthouse have now been identified: Maribel Estrada, the estranged wife of the alleged shooter, David Hernandez Arroyo, and citizen Mark Wilson. Wilson is licensed to carry a concealed weapon and fired several shots at Arroyo. Arroyo, however, was wearing a bulletproof vest.
Four other people were injured in the shooting. Those have been identified as a Tyler Police Detective, Two Smith County Sheriff's Deputies and Arroyo's son.
The Arroyos were at the courthouse for a child support hearing said Tyler Police Chief Gary Swindle.
Unidentified Witness: "We heard loud pops over there and we thought it sounded like firecrackers. And then we noticed the man on the street with a rifle and he was shooting at the policeman over at the courthouse and anyone who came down the front court steps"
According to witnesses, the gunman fired numerous shots from the street toward the courthouse. Several law officers returned fire. It was a shoot-out that lasted several minutes. Windows shattered at businesses around the courthouse as bullets flew in many directions.
KLTV 7 photojournalist Chris Howell and reporter Julie Tam were in Judge Cynthia Kent's courtroom when a gunshot was heard. Moments later, two women ran into the courtroom screaming. The minutes that ensued had numerous officers with guns drawn, police shielded by vehicles with large assault weapons, and citizens, and even Judge Kent herself, crouched down to stay out of the line of fire.
The suspect then fled the downtown area and headed north. Police gave chase and caught the suspect on Highway 271 North. David Hernandez Arroyo fired shots at officers during the pursuit, Police Chief Gary Swindle said. Arroyo was then shot and killed by police.
Those wounded are Arroyo's son, 22 year old David Arroyo, Jr. He was shot in the leg and was in surgery Thursday evening. Also, Smith County Deputy 28-year-old Sherman Dollison is in critical condition, and also was in surgery. Tyler Police Detective Marvin Sewell is in good condition. Tyler Police Officer Clay Parrot was treated and released.
All of the shooting victims have been taken to ETMC in Tyler.

<http://www.komonews.com/weather/blogs/scott/50-years-ago-Northwest-struck-by-worst-storm-on-record-173755001.html?tab=video&c=y> dct:description """Friday marks the 50-year anniversary of the single most devastating storm to strike the Pacific Northwest in the 20th Century.
Aptly dubbed the "Columbus Day Storm", the storm struck with great fury on Oct. 12, 1962, pummeling many areas with well over 100 mph wind gusts and causing catastrophic damage -- mainly across Oregon, but Washington wasn't necessarily left off the hook. 47 people were killed and 317 were hurt.
According to weather researcher Wolf Read, the storm caused between $230-280 million in damage (in 1962 dollars) across California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, making it the worst natural disaster to strike the U.S. in that year. Read says the storm felled 11.2 billion "board feet" of timber and, for example, damaged 70 percent of all homes that resided in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
The storm formed from the remnants of typhoon Freda and re-energized off the California coast into a super storm -- its exact path of development something that had never been recorded before in Northwest climatological history, Read said. Some of the peak wind gusts were over 145 mph at Cape Blanco, Ore., 138 at Newport, 127 at Corvallis, 116 in Portland and 96 in Astoria -- that's not only hurricane strength, but up to Category 3 strength.
Even the Puget Sound area had some amazing gusts. Although Sea-Tac Airport had a paltry 58 mph peak gust (since topped by the 1993 Inauguration Day storm, and again by the Hanukkah Eve Storm of 2006 (68 mph)), Renton reported a gust of 100, Bellingham had 98, Oak Harbor had 90 and Everett had 81 mph.
"Comparisons of peak gusts, where they can be had, tend to put the Big Blow [what he named the storm] at the top," Read wrote in his excellent research of the storm. "But such figures are abstract, and often don't reveal the very reasons why those who lived through the Columbus Day Storm remember it so vividly. The sudden violence of the wind compelled many people to take cover in their homes or basements, a lasting memory, and the sheer magnitude of destruction, in literally all categories of accounting, puts this storm far above any other."
While other wind storms have had stronger storm centers, such as the Nov. 1981 and Dec. 1995 storms, this one stands alone in how it formed -- something Read says it could be another 100-1,000 years before we see a storm like it in our future.
"The storm ruined my birthday!"
Speaking of vivid memories, there are plenty of stories to be told from those who lived through the epic event:
"I was 5 1/2 and in Kindergarten, I remember like it was yesterday," said Teresa Schomber who was in Snoqualmie, Wash. "My dad worked in the woods. The big impact item was my dad picked us up at school (we were town kids and walked) and the fact that DAD picked us up was a never happen. The wind was so strong that he carried each kid to the car one at a time because the wind was making us fly... and it was raining so hard."
She added that the school buses that picked up for Snoqualmie Falls School had men with chainsaws on them and they had to cut trees off the roads to get the kids home.
"I was 17 and in fact it was my birthday," said Shelly Weickum, who was in Burien, Wash. "My parents and sisters took me out to eat. I've never seen wind like that before or since. The wind actually picked up rocks in the street and tossed them. Windows were bowing in and out."
"I was 9 years old, in Longview," says Gretchen Loschen. "I had just gotten glasses for myopia the day before. I remember standing at the window, watching and being enchanted by the fact that I could SEE it, while my mom kept yelling...get away from that window!"
"Pacific Avenue in downtown Tacoma was completely covered with broken glass from all the blown out windows," said Barbara Cobean. "The tallest building at that time was Schonfields Furniture Store and I don't think there was a window left. At one time we passed a traffic light that was laying on the street and it was still cycling."
"I was 11 and my dad had a charter fishing boat moored in Seattle," says Nan Whitehead. "I went with him to secure the lines, and the dock was lifting and slamming down with each wave. There were boats that had already sunk."
"I remember the neighbors window breaking out and he and my dad carried a piece of plywood over to cover the open window, when a gust came up and knocked the neighbor down and my dad still had hold of the board," said Don Hoyt. "The wind picked my dad up off the ground and carried him several feet before he was able to let go, the board went flying and my dad went tumbling like a tumble weed."
Marcia Staunton was working at the federal reserve bank in Portland and said her Dad had to come and pick her up during the storm.
"Dad drove across Broadway Bridge during height of the storm," she said. "Coming home, we came passed Sears windows and saw blown-out (mannequins) striped from windows and clothes blowing around."
And then there was little Christi Baker, who it could be excused if she grew up having disdain for Mother Nature:
"It was my 4th birthday... no one came to my party!!" she said. "I was not a happy little girl."
Wind forces rare evacuation
Among the many tidbits from the storm Read uncovered is the raw notes from the weather observers in Corvallis, Oregon who had to flee the station during the storm. As the winds increased, the observers missed the 3 p.m. observation. Then at 4 p.m., the report showed a wind of 60 knots (69 mph) gusting to 85 knots (98 mph) with a peak gust that hour of 110 knots (127 mph).
15 minutes later, the report notes "ABANDONED STATION". The next day, this notation: "Unreported from 0400-1200 due to power failure and instruments demolished." Read notes that it's the only time in the history of the Pacific Northwest a supervised weather station had to be abandoned due to high winds.
Read said the observers later noted the winds increased further in the 15 minutes as they were leaving, so the 127 mph reading may not have been Corvallis' peak gust.
Video of the storm in progress
Melvin P. Miller managed to get some silent 8mm footage of the storm as it passed through Albany, Ore.:
A relative posted the video on YouTube and says the reel had the hand-written title "Typhoon in Oregon Oct. '62".
And here is another video tour -- this one from McMinnville, Oregon taken by the Fulham family:
How would today's models have fared in forecasting the storm?
UW Atmospheric Sciences professor Cliff Mass made a great presentation Thursday night at the University of Washington commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the storm. One of his topics was to highlight research by the UW's Rick Steed on taking today's modern forecast model and to see how it would have done in predicting the storm in 1962.
The Columbus Day Storm was poorly forecast by the forecast models of the time -- the forecast for the 12th on the 11th called for just scattered showers and had the storm much weaker and going into southern Oregon.
In fact, here are some pictures from the Seattle Times Mass presented, showing the forecasts from Oct. 11:
It was some critical observations by Weather Bureau forecasters in Seattle and Portland (many who were UW alums!) that picked up on some data that the storm was developing to give people at least a several hour lead time the storm was approaching.
Steed went back and gathered the atmospheric data the day before and plugged it into the current forecast model of today. Would it have seen it coming?
No.
It too had the storm much too weak, although it did get the track OK.
Here is a bit from the presentation:
Mass did say the reason a modern model would have failed is that there was not enough data at the time to accurately feed a forecast model. But had a similar storm formed today, Mass was very confident that current models would see it coming.
As I mentioned, Read, who was also at the presentation Thursday presenting his research, has done an excellent write up on the storm at climate.washington.edu. In fact, he's written up just about every wind storm to strike the Northwest. It's a great research site, and find more at climate.washington.edu/stormking

<http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jun/10/high-winds-put-electric-daisy-carnival-hold/> dct:description """High winds put Electric Daisy Carnival on hold during second night
Saturday night at the 2012 Electric Daisy Carnival was anticipated by many to be the most eventful of the three-day festival at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, but extreme weather forced the festival to shut down its acts for the night out of safety concerns.
Increasingly strong winds started around 8 p.m., leading to a temporary shutdown of the festival at around 1 a.m. An estimated 90,000 fans were directed to the speedway’s bleachers as winds reached 30 mph. The acts resumed for a short period but officials then ordered an end to the night's festival because potentially dangerous winds were expected through 5 a.m.
"At 2:45 a.m. Insomniac, the producer of Electric Daisy Carnival, Las Vegas, in consultation with public safety officials, made the decision that due to extremely high wind conditions, the crowd would be cleared away from the stage areas," said a statement released by promoters. "The decision was made out of an abundance of caution and with fan safety in mind."
Fans inside the festival were allowed stay until 5:30 a.m. in the infield grass, where music from temporary sound systems was played. But gates were closed to arrivals and the night's attendance topped at about 90,000.
"Insomniac shares our fans' disappointment that weather conditions changed the second night of the Electric Daisy Carnival experience," said Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella. "Our top priority has always been fan safety and we expect that Mother Nature will be more cooperative tomorrow as we prepare for an amazing day three."
At first, the hope was that the winds would subside. A venue-wide announcement over the PA system said, “This is for your safety, this is a temporary situation. The music will continue as soon as the wind dies." Crowds were asked to keep at least 100 feet from the stages.
According to festival security, the situation came as a preventive measure to avoid any risk posed to the integrity of the seven temporary stages. Last year, a music stage at the Indiana State Fair collapsed amid high winds, killing five and injuring dozens of others.

Fans made their way to the grandstand, though many were frustrated to have the sets of headliners like Scottish DJ Calvin Harris cut off. At one point, the crowd herded into the north end of the stands began chanting “refund.”
“I’m just glad they’re making sure we’re safe,” said Las Vegas resident Amy Messmann, who also attended last year’s festival. “Everyone here knows it’s for their own safety. They’re here for a good time, and they know being rowdy or violent isn’t going to turn the music on faster.”
For some EDC die-hards (and over-caffeinated reporters), the show did unofficially go on at the Speedway last night. Several thousand fans stuck around the Speedway till the fest's scheduled end at 5:30 a.m., during which time they were treated to surprise sets from DJs Steve Aoki and Markus Schulz (both scheduled to play that night) on small "art car" stages in the venue's grassy Cosmic Meadow area.
Notes from the night:
• At 1 a.m., Don Chareunsy, the Sun’s arts and entertainment editor, began the trek home from the Speedway with two friends after standing in the entrance line at EDC for about an hour. “The line was moving, but then it stopped for about 20 to 25 minutes. Nobody was being let inside, then people were emerging from the Speedway saying that EDC was closed for the night.
“Naturally, people were upset and disappointed—the festival-goer who didn’t even make it past the ID check lines with his blown-up green alien looked especially sad—but you can’t control Mother Nature. It was really windy and a little cold for Las Vegas.”
When Chareunsy dropped off his friends at Cosmopolitan, shuttles were still departing the casino resort for EDC.
• At 1:50 a.m., attendees were cleared to return to the venue, but winds picked up again. Half an hour later, performers had yet to return to the stages.
• At 2:10 a.m., Insomniac released the following statement:
With approximately 90,000 fans who have cleared the turnstiles as of 1 a.m. tonight, Insomniac, the producer of Electric Daisy Carnival, Las Vegas asked fans to calmly head to the stands of Las Vegas Motor Speedway as high winds posed a possible threat to fan safety.
At approximately 1 a.m., Insomniac, in conjunction with public safety officials, made the decision to temporarily halt the show while an evaluation on wind conditions was made.
“Fan safety is Insomniac’s highest priority. We cannot control Mother Nature, and we are taking every precaution while high winds continue and have cleared the stage areas temporarily as a preventative measure,” said Pasquale Rotella, the founder and CEO of Insomniac. “We are asking fans to be patient inside and outside the venue while we evaluate the weather conditions.
“As winds are being assessed, a final decision on the status of the production is pending.”
• Overheard on the security radio at 2:30 a.m.: The fire marshal was shutting down the festival for the rest of the night. Traffic reports showed a high volume of attendees leaving around the same time.
• By 2:45 a.m., Metro officers onsite were confirming that the fire marshal had shut down all performances and rides at the festival as the enormous Circuit Grounds stage suffered damage, and winds were expected to remain around 30 mph until 5 a.m.
However, attendees weren’t yet being kicked out and were welcome to remain at LVMS. As of now, the festival will continue with today’s events as planned beginning at 7 p.m.
• At 3:06 a.m., festivalgoers were told to exit the Speedway.

Al Qaeda in Iraq claimed credit for the suicide attack and series of bombings that took place in Baghdad last week and killed scores of Iraqis.
The Islamic State of Iraq, al Qaeda’s political front, claimed the Dec. 22 Baghdad bombings in a statement that was released on jihadist Internet forums yesterday. The statement was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. The claim was made just one day after a suicide attack on Dec. 25 outside the Interior Ministry killed seven policemen.
Over 60 Iraqis were killed and an additional 18 were wounded in more than a dozen attacks executed at security installations, markets, and schools in the capital on Dec. 22.
Al Qaeda in Iraq said the attacks were the latest in what they described as a “series of special invasions … to support the weak Sunnis in the prisons of the apostates and
to retaliate for the captives who were executed by the Safavid [Persian or Iranian] government.”
The term “Safavid government” refers to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, a Shia politician who is accused by al Qaeda in Iraq of being under Iran’s sphere of influence. Maliki has cracked down on Sunni politicians, and immediately after the withdrawal of US troops this month issued an an arrest warrant for Vice President Tariq Hashemi. The move has plunged Iraq into political crisis.
Al Qaeda in Iraq said the targets in the Dec. 22 attack in Baghdad were “accurately surveyed and explored,” and that the “operations were distributed between targeting security headquarters, military patrols and gatherings of the filthy ones of the al-Dajjal Army [Shia warlord Muqtada al Sadr’s Mahdi Army].”
The terror group said it “knows where and when to strike, and the mujahideen will never stand with their hands tied while the pernicious Iranian project showed its ugly face and what it wants with Sunnis in Iraq became obvious and exposed.”
Al Qaeda in Iraq briefly described the suicide attack that targeted a security headquarters in Karrada in Baghdad, and said that details of the other attacks that day would be “published later on.”
Al Qaeda in Iraq, which was degraded by years of Iraqi and US military operations, is taking advantage of the deepening political crisis and Sunni fears that Maliki is an Iranian agent to expand its base of support. Al Qaeda in Iraq has urged Sunnis, particularly members of the Awakening councils, which are made up of tribes and former insurgents, to abandon the government. The terror group has portrayed itself as the only legitimate protector of Sunnis in Iraq.

<http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/01/boko_haram_overruns_1.php> dct:description """Boko Haram overwhelmed Nigerian and allied troops and overran the Multinational Joint Task Force base in northeastern Nigeria yesterday.
At around 5 a.m. yesterday, the al Qaeda-linked jihadists attacked the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) base, which is located just outside the town of Baga in northeastern Borno state, and battled with soldiers for hours. The Boko Haram fighters attacked the MNJTF base “from all directions,” and forced the soldiers to abandon the base, the BBC reported. The number of those killed during the assault, including Nigerian and allied troops as well as Boko Haram fighters, has not been disclosed.
A senator from Borno, Maina Maaji Lawan, confirmed that the base was lost and told the BBC that “[t]here is definitely something wrong that makes our military abandon their posts each time there is an attack from Boko Haram.”
Civilians from Baga and five nearby towns are fleeing the area and crossing into Chad to seek refuge, Vanguard reported.
The MNJTF base, which was manned by troops from Nigeria, Niger, and Chad to interdict criminal activity in the Lake Chad area, was expanded in 2014 to help fight the spread of Boko Haram activity in the area where the borders of Nigeria, Niger, and Chad intersect.
Boko Haram has had success in overrunning large military bases in the past. In December 2013, hundreds of fighters from the jihadist group attacked a Nigerian Air Force base base on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, using trucks and a stolen armored personnel carrier. The jihadists destroyed two helicopters and torched the headquarters building and a police checkpoint before withdrawing.
Later that month, Boko Haram fighters assaulted a base in Bama that housed a tank battalion. An unknown number of soldiers and their families were killed as the fighters attacked the barracks area of the base before withdrawing. [See LWJ report, Boko Haram overruns Nigerian Air Force base, and Threat Matrix report, Boko Haram attacks another base in Borno.]
Boko Haram has rampaged across northeastern Nigerian, particularly in the states of Borno and Yobe, nearly unchecked over the past year. The jihadist group has assaulted and in many cases taken control of towns, kidnapping hundreds of civilians and executing thousands of others, and has even attacked across the border in neighboring Cameroon. A ceasefire between the government and Boko Haram, which was announced in mid-October 2014, was ignored.
Both the United States and the United Nations have tied Boko Haram to al Qaeda’s network. Terrorist designations of Boko Haram leaders as well as the group itself by the US and the UN note links, which include support, training, and cooperation in several battlefields in Africa, between Boko Haram and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Shabaab, and jihadist groups in Mali. [See LWJ reports, UN adds Boko Haram to al Qaeda sanctions list; US adds Boko Haram, Ansaru to list of foreign terrorist groups; US adds 3 Boko Haram leaders to list of global terrorists; and Zawahiri’s man in Shabaab’s ‘secret service’.]
Abubakar Shekau, the emir of Boko Haram, has publicly expressed affinity with al Qaeda. In a video released in November 2012, Shekau praised the global jihadist organization, and said he and his fighters support jihad and the “brothers” in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Chechnya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Somalia, Algeria, Libya, and Mali.

SPRINGFIELD – The number of dead rose to three from Wednesday’s tornadoes as a dozen-storm ravaged communities launched recovery efforts and Massachusetts congressional delegation appealed to the White House for disaster relief.
In a letter to President Obama, U.S. Sen. John Kerry, U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal and six delegation members called for a presidential disaster declaration needed to steer millions in federal aid to homeowners and businesses in central and Western Massachusetts.
The appeal came 18 hours after Gov. Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency after two late-afternoon tornadoes rained destruction on a dozen communities from Westfield to Sturbridge.
A third death - involving a West Springfield mother killed while shielding her 15-year old daughter in a bathtub - was confirmed Thursday, in addition to a West Springfield motorist crushed by a tree and woman camping in Brimfield.
Area hospitals treated about 80 patients suffering from minor injuries to lightning strikes and trauma; at Baystate Medical Center, two required surgery and a third, an assistant district attorney, remains in serious condition after being struck by debris.
No estimates have been provided for the total cost of the storms, but Kerry said he expects the figure will be astronomical.
“I don’t think there’s any question we’re in the tens of millions. Where it goes from there it’s too early to tell. But the bottom line is: I think help will be there,” Kerry said while touring Monson with Patrick and other elected officials.
Berkshire Bank announced it will match all donations to the American Red Cross up to $10,000. The bank’s Springfield and East Longmeadow branches will reopen Friday after being closed Thursday, bank officials announced.
Power outages remained a problem, with 22,000 National Grid customers in Brimfield, Monson and surrounding communities waiting for electricity to return; 13,306 Western Massachusetts Electric customers, mostly in Springfield’s Sixteen Acres and East Forest Park neighborhoods, were also without power Thursday night, down from 17,000 immediately after the storms.
73 Gallery: Massachusetts tornadoes: Aftermath and recovery
Power should be restored to Western Massachusetts Electric customers by the weekend, said spokesman Frank J. Poirot.
Marcy L. Reed, president of National Grid, Massachusetts, said that workers have been on the job non-stop to restore electricity after tornadoes swept into the region Wednesday night causing widespread devastation.
She said 72 percent of Monson is without power.
“Our hearts go out to everyone affected by these devastating storms, especially the families of the four people who lost their lives yesterday,” Reed said.
She cautioned that people who are using generators should place them outside.
As the scope of the storm damage became apparent Thursday, communities turned to emergency workers, to government agencies and each other for help in rebuilding.
In Springfield, the city opened shelters for displaced and homeless people on Thursday at the Greenleaf Community Center on Parker Street in Sixteen Acres, and at Central High School on Roosevelt Avenue.

Approximately 210 people stayed at the MassMutual Center Wednesday night, and were being aided by the American Red Cross and others, said Thomas T. Walsh, the city’s communications director. They were being moved to the new shelters, with transportation provided by the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority.
Cathedral High School, left heavily damaged by the tornado, has rescheduled its graduation and two other events, with all events moved to next week.
The Cathedral graduation exercises will be June 10 at 6 p.m., at St. Michael’s Cathedral on State Street in Springfield.
Cathedral’s Class Night ceremonies will be June 8, at 7 p.m., at Veritas Auditorium, Elms College, in Chicopee. A Baccalaureate Mass will be Thursday, at 7 p.m., at St. Michael’s Cathedral.
Alan J. Ingram, superintendent of the Springfield public schools, said that two elementary schools were too heavily damaged to reopen this school year.
Ingram said Mary A. Dryden Veterans Memorial School at 190 Surrey Road and Elias Brookings School at 367 Hancock Street will not be able to reopen.
All other public schools should reopen the beginning of next week, Ingram said.
Ingram said students in kindergarten through grade 5 from Dryden School will be transferred to the Harris School and students in kindergarten through grade 2 from Brookings School will be transferred to Boland School and students in grades 3, 4 and 5 from Brookings School will be transferred to Rebecca Johnson School
City, state and federal emergency personnel, meanwhile, have “pretty much” completed their primary search for injured or trapped victims and have begun a more thorough secondary search, Fire Department spokesman Dennis G. Leger said.
“We are pretty confident that after the first search that anybody that has been injured has been found,” Leger said.
Delaney said emergency response is being hampered by gawkers coming in from out of the city. “We are telling people to stay out of the area,” he said. “If you want to see devastation it’s going to be there for weeks.”
Delaney said neighbors should help neighbors as emergency personnel continue to clear the streets. “We are clearing the streets first, the houses are secondary,” he said.
Delaney said literally hundreds of building have been damaged throughout the city and numerous streets remain closed.
Leger said the collapse or re-collapse of damaged structures has been a concern for emergency personnel. “If it looks really shaky, they are sending in dogs, if it doesn’t they are sending in people,” Leger said.
Leger stressed that residents clearing off their properties need to be aware of their surroundings. “Don’t touch the wires, people need to be very cautious about that,” Leger said. “This is when people get hurt, after the fact.”
Leger said he knows of several instances on Thursday of people getting injured by falling limbs and collapsing buildings.
All off-duty police personnel were called to duty Wednesday night and the officers, working in teams of six to 12, literally went house to house searching for the trapped and injured, Delaney said.
“We had people trapped in their cellars, people trapped in their cars,” Delaney said.
A number of neighborhoods were impassable by vehicle and the officers had to go on foot. “Literally, police officers could not get to East Forest Park because every avenue was blocked off by trees and downed lines,” Delaney said.
Police had to gain access to the East Forest Park neighborhood through East Longmeadow, Delaney said.
Delaney said emergency personnel set up a command post last night in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame parking lot.
“They turned over their building last night and we had use of their offices and telephone banks and computers,” Delaney said.
City police and firefighters, numerous other fire departments, members of the state police and the National Guard are operating out of the Hall of Fame parking lot, Delaney said.
Emergency response is being bolstered by fire departments from across the state. “Every fire department in the state is represented in Springfield today,” Delaney said.

While Ciancia’s motive remains unclear, reports indicate that he did not intend to be captured by police:
“Police say the shooter’s brother got a text message from Ciancia Friday saying he was thinking about taking his life,” NBC News reported on Friday afternoon based on information provided by anonymous police sources.
RELATED: LAX Shooter Paul Anthony Ciancia’s ‘Anti-Gov’t’ Literature Included Note Targeting ‘TSA and Pigs’
Whiles Ciancia resides in Los Angeles, he grew up in Pennsville in Salem County, New Jersey.
The Associated Press reports that Ciancia entered the airport with a rifle and wearing fatigues. He reportedly had “anti-government literature” on him at the time of his capture and possessed a note which warned that he “wanted to kill TSA and pigs.”
Ciancia shot three people, killing one TSA worker, before he was incapacitated by police.
The shooter remains in critical condition at hospital along with one of his victims. Another of Ciancia’s shooting victims remain in hospital in fair condition.
UPDATE: A New Jersey police chief told CBS News that Ciancia’s father had received a text message from his son “in reference to him taking his own life.”

More about Ultra Music Festival Miami:
Ultra Music Festival was founded and produced in 1999 by business partners Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes. Faibisch, who had attended Depeche Mode‘s Devotional Tour at the Miami Arena in 1993, named the music festival in honor of Depeche Mode’s 1997 album, Ultra.
The first festival was held as a one-day event on March 13, 1999. It coincided with the end of the Winter Music Conference. Inaugural artists at the 1999 fest included Paul van Dyk, Rabbit in the Moon, Josh Wink, and DJ Baby Anne. The first Ultra Music Festival was held in Collins Park in Miami Beach’s South Beach. The festival proved popular with an estimated ten thousand concertgoers in attendance.""" ;

Omes died at 43 on Jan. 12, 2015 in Miami Beach. Courtesy Omes family
UPDATED: A memorial service for Alex Omes will be held at 1 p.m. Jan. 23 at St. Patrick's Church, 3716 Garden Ave., Miami Beach. In lieu of flowers, the family asks for contributions to a fund set up for his son Joshua Omes at https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/3hb7/joshua-omes.
Friends of Alejandro “Alex” Omes, a South Beach nightlife impresario who championed dance music and DJ culture, struggle to comprehend how someone could die so young.
Omes, who published D’VOX magazine and co-founded the popular Ultra Music Festival, died Monday night at age 43.
“Alex was my only sibling and my best friend,” said his brother Carlos Omes. “He was strong and in perfect health. His sudden and untimely death is seemingly unimaginable. … [We] find solace in knowing that Alex touched so many people and that his memory will not be forgotten.”
Omes, who moved to Miami Beach with his mother and brother when he was 9 from Argentina, died Monday night according to the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner. A cause of death has not been released.

His brother, along with attorney Aaron Resnick, who was representing Omes in a two-week trial that was to begin Tuesday related to Omes’ departure from Ultra, became concerned when he didn’t show up for a Tuesday morning court date.
“Alex was a man of principle … deeply spiritual,” said Resnick. “I know Alex would be smiling to know that his legacy is being recognized and will not be forgotten.”
Said friend Carmel Ophir, former owner of The Vagabond in downtown Miami: “He was a rare bird, that rare breed who believes in certain things and had integrity. I credit him as the very first person I met in Miami back in 1989 while I was still on vacation.”
Ophir remembers that January night decades ago, an escape from the cold New York winter, and a jaunty stroll down Ocean Drive. “I heard this awesome sound coming from the Tropics Hotel lounge, this great funky, soul sound. I naturally gravitated there.”
At the door, Ophir remembers an “imposing character, long curly hair, husky guy.”

That was Alex Omes, a graduate of Miami Beach Senior High who would also work as a bouncer at the Cameo club on Washington Avenue. He couldn’t have been friendlier or more invested in a fellow music fan’s interest in DJ culture and happening grooves.
“Here I am, a stranger, and he made sure to check in on me as he made his rounds. Then he invited me to go where the locals hang out,” Ophir said.
The two found themselves at the old Island Club on Seventh and Washington.
“I was vibing,” Ophir said. “That was my first introduction to the DJs of Miami. I quickly felt this sense of Bohemia and community and within a year I was in Miami. I credit him for that, as a spark. That’s nice to know in my history.”
In 2010, Omes left Ultra, which he co-founded with Russell Faibisch in Miami Beach in 1999.
Ultra would grow into one of the largest electronic dance music festivals in the world, luring top DJs like DJ Tiësto, Avicii, and Deadmau5, as well as stars like Black Eyed Peas and Madonna, who, in 2012, used the event’s popularity to promote her MDNA album and sparked controversy with her stage patter that some said was a reference to illegal drugs: “How many people in this crowd have seen Molly?” Madonna wasn’t looking for a lost little girl.
At its peak in 2013, Ultra grew into a six-night, two-weekend event, drawing some 400,000 fans to downtown Miami. Two years after his departure, Omes filed suit to regain control.
On Tuesday, Ultra Music Festival released a statement:
“The organizers of Ultra Music Festival extend their deepest condolences to the family of Alex Omes and are saddened by the news of his passing. We will continue to remember and celebrate Alex for his love, passion and contributions to the Electronic Dance Music community.”
After Ultra, Omes continued to stage events around Miami and, with nightlife partner Emi Guerra, co-founded the event company, Go Big Productions. Go Big hosted successful house music concerts in 2011 and 2012 featuring Swedish House Mafia on the same weekends as Ultra.
Also in 2012, the company’s new UR1 music festival, which was to star Kanye West in downtown Miami during Art Basel activities, was canceled after ticket sales didn’t meet expectations. As publisher, his ’90s dance magazine D’VOX was an early leader in celebrating DJ culture in the community.
“D’VOX was an early focus local publication on DJ culture, music and the underground club scene, and the first publication to bring guys like Seth Browarnik to cover clubs and DJs in a glossy presentation,” Ophir said. “A lot of things that went on in South Beach were [based] on ‘let’s try it out,’ and he was a part of that scene.”
On Facebook, Nicole Alvarez of KROQ radio in Los Angeles recalled her “formative years” in South Beach under Omes’ watchful eye when he was a bouncer.
“He always kept an eye on us, he took care of us, made sure we didn't get into TOO much trouble, and made damn certain no one crossed us. He was like a big brother and our keeper. I remember the exact moment he started his magazine and how passionate he was about it. Failure was not an option, how could it be? He knew exactly what he wanted and he went for it. Boy did he surpass expectations.
“He became a businessman, a father, a friend, and a music guru,” Alvarez posted. “I remember closing down The Spot every night and singing to Bob Marley's Jammin’ and there was Alex at his post, arms crossed, slight grin, watching over the masses. I know I won't ever forget him.”
In addition to his brother, Omes is survived by his son, Joshua.
A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Jan. 23 at St. Patrick's Church, 3716 Garden Ave., Miami Beach. In lieu of flowers, the family asks for contributions to a fund set up for his son Joshua Omes at https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/3hb7/joshua-omes.""" ;

MOUNT WASHINGTON, NH - Today’s Patriot’s Day Storm has brought gusts up to 156 mph and winds equivalent to a category 5 hurricane to the top of Mount Washington. While not common – this is the second time in the past year and only the third time in the past ten years that winds have reached this velocity – it is the direction of the winds that is making Weather Observers jobs very difficult today.
Mount Washington Observatory’s facility, part of Mt. Washington State Park ’s Sherman Adams Building , was designed and positioned to bear strong winds from the northwest. Today’s storm is blowing strong from the east, with sustained winds currently around 100 mph.
Weather Observers are having a tough time keeping instruments clear of ice and debris because of the force of the winds against the observatory doors. According to weather observer Jim Salge, “it is nearly impossible to close the doors to the observatory once we get them open.” Observers continue to have access to the top of the instrument tower, however, accessible via an internal staircase.
The Observatory recently celebrated the history of their record wind on April 12 (an April 12, 1934 gust at 231 mph). Today is a not-so-gentle reminder of the power of wind.
Go to www.mountwashington.org to see video of an exterior door buckling under the powerful easterly winds.
Mount Washington Observatory is a private, non-profit, member-supported organization with a mission to advance understanding of the natural systems that create the Earth's weather and climate. Since 1932, the Observatory has been monitoring the elements in one of the most extreme locations on Earth, using this unique site for scientific research and educational outreach.

While freezing rain is not an uncommon Canadian experience, the ice storm that hit eastern Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick was exceptional. Environment Canada senior climatologist and resident climate expert, David Phillips, provides us with his analysis of how Ice Storm'98 stacks up in the record books. Ice storms are often winter's worst hazard. More slippery than snow, freezing rain or glaze is tough and tenacious, clinging to every object it touches. A little can be dangerous, a lot can be catastrophic. Ice storms are a major hazard in all parts of Canada except the North, but are especially common from Ontario to Newfoundland. The severity of ice storms depends largely on the accumulation of ice, the duration of the event, and the location and extent of the area affected. Based on these criteria, Ice Storm'98 was the worst ever to hit Canada in recent memory. From January 5-10, 1998 the total water equivalent of precipitation, comprising mostly freezing rain and ice pellets and a bit of snow, exceeded 85 mm in Ottawa, 73 mm in Kingston, 108 in Cornwall and 100 mm in Montreal. Previous major ice storms in the region, notably December 1986 in Ottawa and February 1961 in Montreal, deposited between 30 and 40 mm of ice - about half the thickness from the 1998 storm event! The extent of the area affected by the ice was enormous. Freezing precipitation is often described as "a line of" or "spotty occurrences of". At the peak of the storm, the area of freezing precipitation extended from Muskoka and Kitchener in Ontario through eastern Ontario, western Quebec and the Eastern Townships to the Fundy coasts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the United States, icing coated Northern New York and parts of New England. What made the ice storm so unusual, though, was that it went on for so long. On average, Ottawa and Montreal receive freezing precipitation on 12 to 17 days a year. Each episode generally lasts for only a few hours at a time, for an annual average total between 45 to 65 hours. During Ice Storm'98, it did not rain continuously, however, the number of hours of freezing rain and drizzle was in excess of 80 - again nearly double the normal annual total. Unlucky too! The storm brutalized one of the largest populated and urbanized areas of North America leaving more than four million people freezing in the dark for hours, if not, days. Without question, the storm directly affected more people than any previous weather event in Canadian history. Into the third week following the onset of the storm, more than 700,000 were still without electricity. Had the storm tracked 100 km farther east or west of its main target, the disruptive effect would have been far less crippling. How did the storm affect Canada: at least 25 deaths, many from hypothermia.
about 900,000 households without power in Quebec; 100,000 in Ontario.
about 100,000 people took refuge in shelters
residents were urged to boil water for 24 to 48 hours.
airlines and railway discouraged travel into the area
14,000 troops (including 2,300 reservists) deployed to help with clean up, evacuation and security.
millions of residents forced into mobile living, visiting family to shower and share a meal or moving in temporarily with a friend or into a shelter.
prolonged freezing rain brought down millions of trees, 120,000 km of power lines and telephone cables, 130 major transmission towers each worth $100,000 and about 30,000 wooden utility poles costing $3000 each. The damage in eastern Ontario and southern Quebec was so severe that major rebuilding, not repairing, of the electrical grid had to be undertaken. What it took human beings a half century to construct took nature a matter of hours to knock down. Farmers were especially hard hit. Dairy and hog farmers were left without power, frantically sharing generators to run milking machines and to care for new-born piglets. Many Quebec maple syrup producers, who account for 70% of the world supply, were ruined with much of their sugar bush permanently destroyed. to top Photo of Towers: (Jacques Boissinot/CP PHOTO) From CNEWS : Ice Storm Photo Gallery (http://www.canoe.ca/cnewsicestorm/menu.html)

ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL 2013
CONCLUDES WITH MOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR YET
15th ANNIVERSARY EDITION RECEIVED OVER 330,000 FANS OVER TWO WEEKENDS
AND GARNERED OVER 10,000,000 VIEWS VIA LIVESTREAM,
MAKING IT THE MOST-WATCHED FESTIVAL EVENT ONLINE IN THE U.S.
ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL TO RETURN IN 2014
MARCH 28, 29 & 30
Photo credit: Anthony Nunez
ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL wrapped this past weekend (March 22-24) as its most successful year yet. Over 330,000 electronic music enthusiasts descended upon downtown Miami’s Bayfront Park to attend the massive event which took place for the first time in its 15 year history over two weekends: March 15-17 and 22-24. ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL will return next year March 28, 29 and 30, 2014.
Each of the six days were streamed live over the internet via UMF TV reaching over 10,000,000 viewers, making it the largest viewed festival event in the U.S. to date. Over 200 of the world’s leading DJs and electronic musicians as well as emerging artists participated each weekend.
It wouldn’t be ULTRA without special guests. This year Avicii debuted material from his upcoming new album. Wrote Alexei Barrionuevo of the New York Times (3/25/12), “In a preview of his as-yet-untitled debut album, due this summer, Avicii shared the stage with the country and bluegrass artists Mac Davis, Audra Mae and Dan Tyminski, as well as three members of the alternative band Incubus [Mike Einziger, Jose Pasillas, Ben Kenney]. It was a set unlike any other at Ultra, which spanned two weekends this year for the first time, featuring seven stages and more than 200 D.J.s.” Aloe Blacc also joined the performance.
There was also iconic, Grammy-winning guitarist Slash who along with Betatraxx joined Chuckie during his main stage set for a performance of their collaboration “Rocktronica.” Wrote Katie Morse of Billboard (3/23/13), “Chuckie hopes that this collaboration will spawn a new sound and says that he would love to ‘take it all over the world with Slash.’” Martin Solveig was joined by indie-pop singer Kyle for the debut of “Hey Now.”
Another highlight of the festival was the final show from Swedish House Mafia. Wrote Joshua Erenstein and Matthew Spitz of USA Today (3/25/13), “As fans have come to expect from a Swedish House Mafia show, mind-numbing lighting and laser effects, dynamic visuals displayed across massive LED screens, pyrotechnic displays from the band’s beloved “Pyro Pete” and a fireworks finale kept downtown Miami alight for as far as the eye could see. During the waning moments of the show, Axwell grabbed the microphone and asked, ‘Can we have the last dance with you?’ The crowd responded with one last burst of energy as the band’s finale, ‘Save the World’ (feat. John Martin), rocked downtown Miami. ‘Miami is where it all started,’ proclaimed Axwell. Now Miami is where it has ended for Steve Angello, Axwell, and Sebastian Ingrosso… for now.”
Other critical quotes for ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL include:
“Getting one’s head around the entirety of Miami’s Ultra Music Festival is nigh impossible – and not just because this year, its 15th, the festival has expanded, Coachella-style, to two consecutive weekends with largely the same lineup. For one thing, Ultra has seven stages going at once (to say nothing of numerous after-parties at Miami’s clubs); for another, while big, banging EDM was the clear order of the day, the sheer variety of DJs and live performers defied any attempt at too neatly cohesive a narrative.” – Michaelangelo Matos, ROLLING STONE (3/18/13) “The event attracts the world’s top DJs and producers, along with an expected 330,000 fans, mostly young people looking for a brief respite…The festival is set up at Bayfront Park in the middle of downtown. Festivalgoers can go from one stage to another, the lights of the city beaming nearby. It’s visually spectacular, and the crowd is a spectacle.” – Christine Amario, MIAMI HERALD/NY DAILY NEWS/ASSOCIATED PRESS (3/16/13) “New tracks were sampled, a Trap tent was born and every genre under the EDM umbrella was heard.” – Sarah Harper, MTV (3/25/13) “…UMF still definitely packs enough blips, bass and breaks to make any dance music fan squeal with excitement.” – Jose Duran, MIAMI NEW TIMES (3/14/13) “Ultra Music Festival celebrated its 15th annual edition by expanding over two three-day weekends (a la Coachella) making it the largest electronic music festival in the US and the only one in the world to take place over two weekends. Acts included some of the world’s biggest EDM names such as Tiësto, Armin Van Buuren, David Guetta, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris to non dance music artist like Snoop Dogg and Yesayer. Overlooking the breathtaking downtown Miami skyline and marina at Bayfront Park, the festival brought over 165,000 dance music fans (March 22-24) from all over the world – literally. The sea of participants adorned flags, shirts, hats and everything you could imagine to represent their hometowns, states and countries.” – Alejandra Loera, OC WEEKLY (3/26/13) “If you want to find a happy place, may we suggest Ultra Music Festival? There’s nary a frown at the whirling neon EDM bacchanal, which just concluded its first of two consecutive weekend takeovers of Miami’s Biscayne Boulevard and Bayfront Park with the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Kaskade, and Richie Hawtin…what’s even more striking than the fashion — or at least comes close — is how well-run the festival is. Ultra has seven stages, dozens of major acts to juggle at any one time, more than 100,000 attendees, and a small village’s worth of bathrooms, venders, carts, tents, and security. But the festival, in its 15th year, is a marvel of organization and runs incredibly smoothly, especially considering its tight footprint Downtown.” –Janie Campbell, THE HUFFINGTON POST (3/18/13) “The party continued as Ultra Music Festival saw its fifth day of mayhem yesterday, delivering another sun-kissed day of dance music in the Miami heat. Officially the most ticketed event in the history of ticketed events, Ultra continues to impress with its massive lineup, special sets, and only-at-Ultra moments.” – Dylan Farella, DANCING ASTRONAUT (3/24/13) “ULTRA didn’t disappoint when it came to the visuals, the sounds, the mechanical contraptions which seemed to be the creation of some mad scientist or extraterrestrial. Everything was thought out thoroughly, placement of various stages and various amenities was flawless.” – Paloma Hsu, OKAYFUTURE(March 2013)

ULTRA WORLDWIDE
ANNOUNCES ‘ULTRA EUROPE’ JULY 12, 13 & 14, 2013
COMMITS TO A FIVE-YEAR RESIDENCY IN CROATIA
ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL–the world’s premier electronic music festival–is coming to Croatia July 12, 13 & 14, 2013 for ULTRA EUROPE, it was announced in a press conference in Zagreb today, November 28. Taking place in the city of Split July 12 & 13 and the island of Hvar July 14 for the very first time, organizers have also revealed the further news that ULTRA EUROPE will now be housed exclusively in Croatia for at least the next five years.
WATCH THE OFFICIAL ULTRA EUROPE TEASER VIDEO
With over 60,000 attendees expected to descend upon Croatia for the debut edition of the annual event next summer, ULTRA EUROPE will take place at the beautiful Poljud Stadium in Split for the first and second days, while the third and final day will see the event hop to the Hotel Amfora Grand Beach Resort on the stunning island of Hvar, just a short ferry journey away. Performances from all three days will be streamed globally through UMF TV and UMF Radio.
Besides being the only European edition of the world-renowned Ultra Music Festival next year, ULTRA EUROPE will also be one of the first major events of its kind in Croatia following the country’s expected entrance into the European Union July 1, 2013. It is also predicted that the ULTRA EUROPE festival will inject more than 20 million euros (over 150 million kuna) into Croatia’s economy over the next five years and is considered to be one of the most important investments in the Croatian tourism and entertainment industry in recent times.
Russell Faibisch, Founder, Executive Producer and CEO of Ultra Music Festival and Ultra Worldwide, shared his excitement by saying:
“Electronic music is one of the most popular and fastest growing genres in the world, and the Ultra Music Festival has been recognized as one of the leading festivals of that genre. Taking into consideration the highly developed music scene in Croatia and the excellent reputation of Split and Hvar as top tourist destinations, the decision to bring Ultra Music Festival and the incredible experience it has to offer to Croatia in the form of Ultra Europe was an easy one to make. We strongly believe that electronic music fans are acutely aware of what Ultra Music Festival represents and will come in great numbers to share this amazing experience in both Split and Hvar this July.”
Adam Russakoff, Executive Producer, Talent Booker and Director of Business Affairs for Ultra Music Festival and Ultra Worldwide, went on to say:
“I’m extremely excited about this new chapter for Ultra and our expansion into the European market. The recent boom in music tourism in that region, coupled with Croatia’s expected entry into the European Union in July 2013, makes perfect sense for us from a business perspective. Concerning talent, while we’re not yet at liberty to disclose the finer details regarding specific artists for Ultra Europe 2013 at this stage, what I can say is that since its inception back in 1999, Ultra has always prided itself upon programming the most forward thinking, innovative line-ups any festival in the world has to offer. With regards to Ultra Europe, we have whole-heartedly committed to upholding this tradition and I can personally guarantee that this year’s program will be no exception.”
Joe Basic, director of Adria MM Production, the Croatian partner and co-organizer of the festival, added:
“Ultra Europe will undoubtedly be one of the most important music events in the region in 2013. We are very proud that we as local partners can give our support and host such a reputable event in the cities of Split and Hvar. There is no question that Ultra Europe will make a significant and positive impact on the region as it looks to attract thousands of music lovers to these historical regions each summer for 3 days of truly world-class electronic music and entertainment. I am confident that the beautiful Adriatic Sea and Islands of the area will be a perfect setting for Ultra Europe and will attract many to come and experience all that both Ultra and Croatia have to offer.”
TICKET INFORMATION
A limited number of early bird tickets for days 1 & 2 at the Poljud Stadium will go on sale on December 5, priced at a staggeringly cheap €40 (300 Kuna).

Phase 1 of the line-up will be revealed at 12:00 pm (local time) on December 12.

MARCH 28 & 29 AT BICENTENNIAL PARK IN MIAMI
As anticipation grows for the 10-year anniversary installment of ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL (UMF) happening March 28 and 29 in Miami, its promoters have announced additions to the all-star line-up with confirmed performances by The Bravery, Eric Prydz, Junkie XL, Union Jack, VJv2 and The Veez.
Making their first appearance at UMF and only during WMC, The Bravery will bring their unique sounds including radio hit "Time Won't Let Me Go" from their sophomore album The Sun and the Moon (Island) on Friday, March 28. Swedish DJ, producer and label head (Mouseville, Pryda, Pryda Friends) Eric Prydz–best known for his hit singles "Call On Me" which sampled Steve Winwood's hit "Valerie" and “Proper Education” which fused Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick In The Wall’s” school choir chorus into a UK & European chart smash for Ministry of Sound—will appear on the same day.
Also set for Friday, March 28, the one man band known as Junkie XL makes a return to UMF's main stage for his WMC exclusive performance with a high-voltage live set highlighting tracks off of his new album Booming Back At You (Artwerk Music) out March 11, including international club smash "More" and new single "Cities In Dust." U.K. ska act The Veez also joins.
The new addition for Saturday, March 29 is Union Jack—consisting of Simon Berry ('Art Of Trance', Platipus Records founder) and Claudio Giussani (EXUS, Terra Ferma, Urban Shakedown)— who co-headlined the very first UMF in 1999. The musical innovators will be joined by Paul Brogen (POB) for their first show anywhere in seven years. Main Stage visual artistry for both days will be created by Vello Virkhaus, VJv2.
Previously announced festival highlights include performances by Underworld, Tiësto and Paul van Dyk (performing a very rare live set with a full band and several guest vocalists from his current release In Between (Mute) including Jessica Sutta of the Pussycat Dolls, Ashley Tomberlin and Rea Garvey, among others), two exclusive days of Carl Cox & Friends plus additional exclusive live performances and DJ sets during WMC by Justice, Moby, BT, Digitalism, Calvin Harris, Rabbit In The Moon, Deadmau5, Second Sun and Enur, whose WMC exclusive performance marks their U.S. debut.

<http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/weather/tornado-damage-reported-in-springfield-25-apx-20110601> dct:description """SPRINGFIELD (FOX 25 / MyFoxBoston.com) - The Rev. Bob Marrone was pained to see the steeple of his 137-year-old church shattered and strewn on the grass in the central Massachusetts town of Monson, yet he knows he's more fortunate than some of his neighbors who lost their homes after tornadoes tore through the state, killing four people and injuring about 200.
"I can see the plywood of roofs, and see houses where most of the house is gone," said Marrone, pastor of The First Church of Monson. "The road that runs up in front of my house. ... There's so many trees down, it's completely impassable."
Residents of 18 communities in central and western Massachusetts woke to widespread damage Thursday, a day after at least two late-afternoon tornadoes shocked emergency officials with their suddenness and violence and caused the state's first tornado-related deaths in 16 years.
Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick is clarifying this morning that three people died during the storm. Yesterday, they were saying four people, but apparently, the fourth person had a heart attack after the storms struck.
Authorities have released the names of two people killed. West Springfield Police Chief Thomas Burke said Angelica, or Angelique, Guerrero she died Wednesday saving her 15-year-old daughter. Burke said Guerrero put her daughter in the bathtub and covered the girl with her own body. When the house came down on top of them, Guerrero was crushed. The girl suffered severe leg lacerations. Guererro's husband was also hurt. Both remained hospitalized Thursday.
Sergey Livchin also died in West Springfield when his van was crushed by a falling tree. Police said the 23-year-old died a short distance from his home and only about 2 blocks from the Guerreros. Authorities have not released the names of the other victims.
Sens. John Kerry and Scott Brown joined Gov. Deval Patrick on a helicopter tour of the damaged areas, including Springfield, the state's third-largest city. Kerry said it looked like a "blast zone" and was confident that federal disaster aid would be made available, particularly because of damage to businesses.
Patrick said it was unbelievable that so much destruction was caused in such a short period of time.
"You have to see it to believe it," he said after a tour of Monson, a town of fewer than 10,000 residents near the Connecticut border. "Houses have been lifted up off their foundations and in some cases totally destroyed or moved several feet."
Authorities were still calculating how many tornadoes hit the area.
Two people were killed in West Springfield and another in Brimfield, authorities said. Public health officials said about 200 people sought medical treatment for storm-related injuries.
The death in West Springfield was a woman who used her body to shield her 15-year-old daughter in a bathtub in their apartment, Patrick said. The daughter survived.
One tornado was dramatically captured on a mounted video camera as it tore through Springfield, a city of more than 150,000 about 90 miles west of Boston.
At the MassMutual Center, a cavernous event facility, the tornado terrified photographers amassed for a high school prom as it whirled outside the floor-to-ceiling windows.
"It looked like birds were flying out of the trees and it was rubble," said Martha Vachon, of Photography by Duval of Palmer. The prom went on that night as scheduled.
The storm pulverized or sheared off the tops of roofs on Main Street in Springfield. A debris-filled funnel swept into downtown from the west, then swirled across the Connecticut River.
"Everything started shaking. The whole building was shaking," said Shonda Lopez, who was at home when the tornado struck before dinner time.
Lopez's sister, Margaret Alexander, hid in a closet in her apartment during the storm. She and 15 family members, including a daughter, two granddaughters and the family dog, Sasha, in a crate later went to the MassMutual Center, which was converted into an emergency shelter.
Among the injured in Springfield was an assistant district attorney who was struck by debris as she left her office and walked across a parking lot, Hampden District Attorney Mark Mastroianni said. He did not identify her but said she is expected to survive.
Mastroianni said he and other staff members narrowly escaped injury when plate glass windows shattered and blew into his office. He heard screams to get away from the windows, and he and the other workers ran away just in time.
The governor declared a state of emergency and called up 1,000 National Guardsmen after the storms, which brought scenes of devastation more familiar in the South and Midwest to a part of the country where such violent weather isn't a way of life.
Patrick said there was extensive damage in Hampden County, especially to homes and other structures. He asked superintendents in the 19 affected communities to cancel school Thursday and told nonessential state employees in counties impacted by the storms to stay""" ;

Choummaly Sayasone, the country's most powerful figure, was confirmed as president while Thongsing Thammavong was re-appointed by legislators as prime minister, the official Lao News Agency (KPL) reported.
The new terms were widely expected after Choummaly was approved as chief of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party at its March Congress. He has held the twin posts of president and party chief since 2006.
Thongsing, a former president of the National Assembly, took the role of prime minister in December after the surprise resignation of his predecessor.
He is the sixth person to hold the post since communist forces came to power in 1975, establishing a one-party state.
The new 132-seat legislature began meeting Tuesday following nationwide elections in late April.
But the real power remains with the ruling Politburo and Central Committee chosen at the Congress by fewer than 600 party members behind closed doors, analysts say.
Both Vietnam and China vie for influence in landlocked Laos, which is rapidly developing but remains one of Asia's poorest nations.
The government spokesman could not be reached for comment.""" ;

<http://www.nbc29.com/Global/story.asp?S=11704169> dct:description """Crews with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) continue working to clear interstate highways and major primary roads around the state after the major snow storm dropped up to two feet of snow in some areas of western Virginia.
Motorists are asked to avoid travel today if at all possible as roads remain snow covered and treacherous in much of the commonwealth and as a significant number of accidents and disabled vehicles are blocking roadways.
Portions of Interstate 81 remain closed after serious overnight accidents have blocked the roadway and hindered snow-removal efforts. Portions of I-77 near the West Virginia border have also been closed sporadically through the night and day due to accidents and weather-related impacts.
VDOT, State Police and the Virginia National Guard are working with local governments to reach motorists who are stranded in their vehicles but they are hindered by disabled vehicles and accidents. Emergency supplies are being provided to motorists by local governments and the Virginia National Guard.
Drivers are being asked to stay with their vehicles unless there is an emergency so that snow-removal crews can get traffic flowing as soon as accidents are clear. Abandoned vehicles block roadways and prevent plows from clearing snow. For traffic updates, motorists should call 511 or visit 511Virginia.org. If a stranded motorist is in immediate danger or is experiencing an emergency, they should dial #77 or 911.
Motorists waiting in traffic should:
Stay with their vehicles
Conserve fuel but periodically turning off their vehicle. Motorists should run their vehicles for 10 minutes to warm the passenger cabin, and then turn the engine off for 20 minutes to conserve fuel.
Understand that it will take time for emergency crews to reach them, however state and local emergency responders and road crews are working to get to them and restore traffic flow.
Driving Tips
VDOT reminds motorists to use caution when driving during wintry weather. Drivers should:
Only travel today and tomorrow if it is absolutely necessary. With road conditions still listed as severe for most of the commonwealth, it is best to stay off the roads if you can.
If you must travel, check road conditions before they leave home by calling 511 or logging in to 511Virginia.org
Slow down and allow for extra time to reach your destination
Keep a safe distance of at least five seconds behind other vehicles and trucks that are plowing the road
Do not pass a snowplow or spreader unless it is absolutely necessary
VDOT's Winter Weather Facts
VDOT has 2,314 pieces of snow removal equipment, 3,146 crew members, 62,000 tons of sand and 239,000 tons of salt working to clear roads during this storm, and it has enlisted private contractors to assist state crews.
VDOT crews will work around the clock to address this significant snowfall.
Crews focus on the highest traffic roads first—clearing interstate highways and major primary roads before working on secondary roads and subdivision streets
VDOT's goal is to have all roads passable within 48 hours after a storm ends
Motorist Resources
VDOT has a variety of information sources for road condition updates. The 511 traveler-information service gives drivers the most up-to-date data available about weather, construction and accidents that may affect travel. Updates can be received by calling 511 from any landline or wireless phone or by going online to www.511virginia.org to view traffic cameras, the road condition map and the road condition table-report. Individuals can sign up for e-mail alerts that include weather and incident reporting on the 511 Web site.

NBC 5's Anthony Ponce reports. (Published Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016)
Three "edge weapons" were used to carry out a gruesome slaying of six family members in their home in the Gage Park neighborhood of Chicago, police said.
Police found the bodies around 1 p.m. last Thursday when they were called to a small brick house in the 5700 block of South California Avenue after one of the men failed to show up for work.
Five of the six — 58-year-old Rosaura Martinez; her 60-year-old husband, Noe Martinez Sr.; their 38-year-old son, Noe Martinez Jr.; and the couple's grandchildren,13-year-old Leonardo Cruz and 10-year-old Alexis Cruz — died from either multiple sharp force or multiple sharp and blunt force wounds, police said.
Three types of knives or other bladed cutting instruments were used to carry out most of the killings, according to police, but those weapons were not recovered from the crime scene.
‘Edge Weapons’ Used in Gage Park Family Massacre
Investigators uncovered more on how six family members were brutally murdered in their home on Chicago’s Southwest Side last week. NBC 5’s Michelle Relerford reports. (Published Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016)
The young children's mother, 32-year-old Maria Herminia Martinez, died of multiple gunshot wounds, police said. A rifle gun was recovered from the home but is not believed to have been used in her shooting, police said.
Authorities are reviewing hours of surveillance video from CTA buses and nearby city cameras for evidence in the investigation. Police said they are closer to ruling out at least one theory on a motive for the slayings of three generations of family members. It's not clear who killed them.
Investigators continue to interview family members coming from Mexico with the aid of the Mexican Consulate in Chicago, which is working to bring the victims’ bodies to Mexico for burial.
The surviving family of the victims has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to cover funeral and burial expenses. As of Thursday morning it had raised more than $26,000.

<http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/LAX-TSA-Shooting-Rampage-Paul-Ciancia-Death-Penalty-287505621.html> dct:description """The federal death-penalty trial of the man accused in a deadly shooting rampage at Los Angeles International Airport will likely take place next year, attorneys said. Angie Crouch reports for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 5, 2015. (Published Monday, Jan. 5, 2015)
The death penalty trial of a man accused of a deadly shooting rampage at Los Angeles International Airport is tentatively scheduled for next year.
Defense lawyers for defendant Paul Ciancia told a federal judge Monday they will try to meet the projected trial date of Feb. 23, 2016.
The judge had wanted a trial this year, but it will take significantly longer to prepare because the prosecution is seeking a death sentence if Ciancia is convicted.
Prosecutors said in court papers that they would seek execution because Ciancia intentionally targeted federal employees, and terrorized passengers and airport workers.
Inside the LAX Mayhem
Ciancia, 24, a New Jersey native, has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in the killing of Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez, 39, and the wounding of three other people at LAX on Nov. 1, 2013.
U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said he thought the case could be tried by September, but he's willing to push it back to early next year. However, he said "something tremendous" would have to occur to delay it further.
Public defenders have said they have a mountain of evidence to digest. Prosecutors have disclosed at least 10,000 pieces of evidence, or 150 DVDs full of material.
Death penalty cases are more complex because lawyers have to prepare for guilt and penalty phases, and that often involves intensive digging for information from people who knew the defendant, even dating back to childhood.
"There's often a serious psychiatric component to these cases," said attorney Marilyn Bednarski, a former federal defender who represented Buford Furrow, a white supremacist who killed a Filipino postal worker and wounded five people in a 1999 shooting at a Los Angeles Jewish community center. "It's just not normal behavior. Often people are terribly mentally ill and those things take a long time to investigate."
Federal death penalty cases are relatively rare.
LAFD Training to Enter "Warm Zones" of Active Shootings
Tactical Emergency Medical Support training for responders is included in a report on the Nov. 1 response to a gunman with a high-powered inside an LAX terminal. Jane Yamamoto reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Tuesday July 1, 2014. (Published Tuesday, July 1, 2014)
U.S. prosecutors have sought the punishment about 500 times since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. During that time, there were 79 death sentences, but only three people have been executed.

<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22173398> dct:description """A wintry storm caked the center of the nation with a thick layer of ice Monday, blacking out more than 600,000 homes and businesses, and more icy weather was on the way. At least 17 deaths in Oklahoma and Missouri were blamed on the conditions, with 15 of them killed on slick highways.
A state of emergency was declared for all of Oklahoma, where the sound of branches snapping under the weight of the ice echoed through Oklahoma City.
"You can hear them falling everywhere," Lonnie Compton said Monday as he shoveled ice off his driveway.
The National Weather Service posted ice and winter storm warnings Tuesday for parts of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. Missouri declared an emergency on Sunday and put the National Guard on alert.
Widespread outages
Oklahoma utilities said a half-million customers were blacked out as power lines snapped under the weight of ice and falling tree branches, the biggest power outage in state history, and utilities in Missouri said more than 100,000 homes and business had no power there.
"If you do the math, probably one out of three Oklahomans has no electricity at this point," said Gil Broyles, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility.
Roughly 11,000 customers were blacked out in southern Illinois and more than 5,000 had no electric heat or lights in Kansas, where Gov. Kathleen Sebelius declared a statewide state of emergency.
At O'Hare International Airport, about 100 flights were canceled by Monday afternoon, with delays of about 45 minutes, said Chicago Department of Aviation spokeswoman Karen Pride. No flights were canceled at Midway Airport, but a handful of flights were delayed about an hour, she said.
Ice was as much as an inch thick on tree limbs and power lines in parts of the region.
Schools, hospitals disrupted
Schools across Oklahoma were closed and some hospitals were relying on backup power generators. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers sent 50 generators and three truckloads of bottled water from Texas to distribute to blacked-out areas of Oklahoma.
Video: Deadly storm Tulsa International Airport had no power for about 10 hours and halted flight operations for the day, and most morning flights at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City were canceled because of icy runways. Greyhound bus passengers were stranded overnight at a shelter in a church in Tulsa, and were joined by some local residents who had no heat.
Portions of Interstate 35 and Interstate 44 were shut down early Monday afternoon in Oklahoma City after ice-laden power lines collapsed and fell into the roadways.
Oklahoma utility officials said it could be a week or more before power was fully restored.
"This is a big one. We've got a massive situation here and it's probably going to be a week to 10 days before we get power on to everybody," said Ed Bettinger, a spokesman for Public Service Company. "It looks like a war zone."
The Oklahoma City suburb of Jones, a town of 2,500 people, had low water pressure because there was no electricity to run well pumps, and firefighters said an early morning fire destroyed most of the community's high school.
Since the storm began, Tulsa firefighters have responded to dozens of structural fires, most attributable to the storm, said Sheryl Lovelady, a city spokeswoman. One person was killed by smoke inhalation in a storm-related fire, she said; she did not provide details.
Icy in the Northeast
The icy weather stretched into the Northeast, where many schools across upstate New York were closed or started late because of icy roads.
On ice-covered Interstate 40 west of Okemah, Okla., four people died in "one huge cluster of an accident" that involved 11 vehicles, said Highway Patrol Trooper Betsey Randolph.
Ten other people died on icy Oklahoma roads, and Missouri had two storm-related deaths — one on a slippery highway and another when a tree limb fell on a 92-year-old man's head. In addition, a homeless person died of hypothermia in Oklahoma City, the state medical examiner's office said.""" ;

<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22197793> dct:description """While millions of people in the nation's midsection tried to thaw out and get power restored, the Northeast was told to expect a double winter whammy starting Thursday that should blanket the region in a foot or more of snow.
The weather system that froze Midwest states was expected to arrive in the Northeast after the Thursday morning commute, according to NBC WeatherPlus meteorologist Bill Karins.
"Everyone will get to work just fine, but getting home should be ugly," he said. "A heavy burst of snow and sleet will fall from New York City to southern New England, especially between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.
"South of New York City more sleet will mix in and cut down on snow totals, but still make it a slick ride home" as far south as Philadelphia, he added.
Snow totals from the first storm could be 4-6 inches in Boston, New York City and other Northeast areas. Philadelphia could see an inch, Karins said.
A second storm making its way from the Pacific Northwest, through Texas and then southern Plains states on Friday, should reach the Northeast with rain by Saturday night. Along the way it could dump 12-18 inches of snow in some areas.
By Saturday night, "heavy snow and blizzard conditions" are likely from central Pennsylvania, central New York and New England, Karins said.
Conditions Sunday were predicted to include moderate coastal flooding at high tide in New England, wind gusts up to 70 mph on the coast and heavy snow in northern New England. Snow showers are likely from Philadelphia to southern New England.
The forecast came as utility crews struggled to repair power lines snapped by the ice storm that had blacked out as much as a million homes and businesses across the nation’s midsection.
'Nasty outside'
The forecast came as utility crews struggled to repair power lines snapped by the ice storm that had blacked out as much as a million homes and businesses across the nation’s midsection.
Repair crews and homeowners still faced a mixture of snow, sleet and light rain that fell across parts of north Texas and central Oklahoma during the morning.
“It will still be cold and nasty outside and may slow efforts to restore power and remove tree limbs and such,” said Patrick Burke, a weather service meteorologist in Norman, Okla.
The new system could also bring more freezing rain to Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas, but not nearly as much as the previous storm, according to the National Weather Service.
Ice ranging from a quarter-inch to an inch thick glazed roads in much of the central Plains and Midwest. At least 27 deaths have been blamed on the storm since it developed last weekend. Most resulted from traffic accidents.
Forecasters said more snow, sleet and freezing rain could also develop across the northern Ohio Valley and from Pennsylvania into New England on Wednesday.
About a half million homes and business still had no power Wednesday in Oklahoma, which saw its worst power outage on record. That was down from a peak of some 618,000 customers Tuesday, but utility officials said it could be a week to 10 days before power is fully restored.
"We're relying on people to look after each other," Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said. "At the end of the day, this comes down to the strength of your people. ... People who have electricity ought to be sharing it with people who don't."
Ice, snow hits Iowa
Elsewhere, around 229,000 customers were still blacked out in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska. Kansas’ tally had risen — to 130,000 on Wednesday, up 15,000 from Tuesday — as rural electric cooperatives reported in and falling branches brought down more power lines.
In Iowa, about 33,000customers were without power as thick ice caused trees and branches to crash into power lines.
Ice prompted the Des Moines International Airport to close late Tuesday. It reopened just before noon Wednesday. Most of the state's largest school districts canceled classes, including Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Council Bluffs and Dubuque.
Lesley Owczarski, owner of Big Apple Bagels in Ottumwa, Iowa, said Tuesday the power was on at her shop, but many of her customers weren't so lucky.
"Most of the places don't have power so a lot of people have been coming to the bagel shop," she said. "If they can come in and get warm and have a hot coffee and a latte, why not? I can understand it's boring sitting at home."
Most people decided to stay home and bundle up rather than go to shelters.
"We've got kerosene lamps and a fireplace," said Charita Miller of Oklahoma City. "We're OK. We can't watch TV. Oh well, you can't have everything. It's just me and my husband. My husband said, 'There's food in the freezer.'"
'I'm not the only one'

<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22239846> dct:description """Lisa Wofford had just moved out of her apartment and was planning to move her family into a house when a winter storm knocked a power pole onto the new digs, preventing her from closing on it.
By Friday, the newly homeless Wofford was on her fifth day at an American Red Cross shelter, and an approaching snowstorm cast even more uncertainty on her future.
“I’m praying for no snow. I don’t want to be here any longer,” Wofford said before starting in on her lunch of pasta and green beans. “I’ve slept, like, seven hours since Monday. I’m running on faith.”
The second wintry blast could complicate efforts to restore power to the more than 280,000 homes and businesses in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri still blacked out after the first storm put a million customers in the dark at its height this week.
That storm, which coated much of the Plains in ice before moving dumping snow on the Northeast, has killed at least 38 people, mostly in traffic accidents. It has been blamed for 23 deaths in Oklahoma alone.
Utilities in the Plains said nearly 400,000 customers remained without power on Friday due to ice storms this week. Electric companies reported that more than 800,000 of the 1.2 million customers who lost power have had it restored.
The next storm was predicted to bring 2 to 6 inches of snow to parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, said Ken Harding, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Recovery efforts hampered in Midwest
The service issued winter weather watches for the northwest two-thirds of Oklahoma from Friday afternoon through Saturday morning. By late Friday afternoon, snow was already falling on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.
An Xcel Energy serviceman working to restore power in an Oklahoma City neighborhood peppered by toppled trees said Friday that he expected the new storm to hamper recovery efforts, but not create massive new power failures.
“All this kind of work is safety-based, so any time you get another weather aspect, then there goes another safety factor,” said Scott Falkner, of Clovis, N.M.
Weather Service meteorologist Pete Snyder agreed with that assessment.
“For crews that are out there trying to restore power, it’d be more of a headache,” Snyder said.
The storm also threatened to steal manpower from efforts to clear fallen trees. Dan Crossland, a public works official in Tulsa, said almost every city crew removing downed tree limbs will be spun off to clear the streets when the second storm comes.
“I intend to stay on 12-hour shifts until every street is clear,” Crossland said. “These guys are dragging.”
The Kansas National Guard continued to deliver generators and supplies to communities, knowing more would be needed.
Northeast also braces for blanketing
The first storm changed from ice to snow as it blew into the Northeast, dumping 2 inches to a foot across the region and catching many municipalities by surprise, even after it wreaked havoc to the west.
The National Weather Service said the region could expect another blast over the weekend, when a second storm is expected to drop 6 inches of snow and sleet starting on Saturday evening.
“As the system gets to the Northeast, it’s really going to intensify and deepen and this is going to cause a lot of trouble,” said Brian Korty, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
"It is a powerful Northeaster," added colleague Charlie Foley. "The difference in this storm is that it is going to occur during the overnight hours and on the weekend, so we wouldn't expect it to have the impact that this thing yesterday did."
Thursday's snowfall in Boston set a new one-day record for Dec. 13 and was more than the 7.8 inches that typically falls during the entire month of December.
‘Airlines will have to play catch up’
Logan Airport had returned to normal operations by Friday, with about 41 outbound flights canceled, said spokesman Phil Orlandella. On Thursday, more than 400 flights were canceled.
"The airlines will have to play catch up for a couple of days," Orlandella said. "It's not a madhouse here, things are moving pretty well."
He said airport management did not yet know how their operations would be affected by the weekend storm.
Some commuters in Boston spent eight hours driving home Thursday evening, and public school buses were still dropping off students at 11 p.m.
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick defended the state’s storm response Friday after meeting with public safety, transportation and emergency officials.""" ;

<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28193030> dct:description """Bitter cold, with record-breaking subzero temperatures in some places, gripped much of the nation Monday, keeping people indoors and leading some cities to open shelters.
An exception was the Northeast, where unseasonably mild weather Monday melted ice on trees and soothed the nerves of those who have gone without power since an ice storm four days ago.
"Finally, everyone is walking around in the neighborhood. It is so nice," said JoAnn Trudeau, 62, of Hooksett, who hasn't had power since Friday morning.
Elsewhere, arctic air blew southward across the Midwest and West.
The cold and remnants of the weekend blizzard that accompanied it closed hundreds of schools from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes states.
'Scary, scary situation'
The St. Francis House shelter for the homeless in Sioux Falls, S.D., where Monday's low was minus 11, was a lifesaver, said Richard Byrd.
"I would be probably huddled up right now under a bunch of blankets because this was my only alternative. If it wasn't for the St. Francis house, I'd be in a scary, scary situation," he said.
Major highways in Minnesota, and North and South Dakota reopened after Sunday's blizzard dropped as much as 14 inches of snow, but hundreds of schools were closed in the three states.
Monday morning lows in North Dakota included minus 18 in Bismarck, with a wind chill factor of minus 42. The smaller communities of Bowbells and Berthold reported wind chill factors at around 50 below.
In Williston, N.D., Penny Groth acknowledged: "It's just darn cold right now." She said the Gramma Sharon's Family Restaurant she owns had been closed since Saturday night because of the snow and cold.
An about-face
Monday's cold was an abrupt change for many areas. Illinois had unseasonable warmth Sunday with temperatures in the 50s, but Monday morning lows were in the single digits across the northern part of the state. Rockford had a low of just 3, and 20 mph wind made it feel like minus 18, the National Weather Service said.
"Right now it looks like it's about 14 degrees," cashier Mike Kanise said Monday afternoon as he checked a weather station at Hannel's Amaco truck stop in Jacksonville, Ill. "Feels like it's minus 1."
Hundreds of Illinois schools were closed because of ice-covered roads. More schools were closed in Michigan, where northern areas had blizzard conditions as wind gusting to more than 50 mph caused whiteouts and generated wind chills as low as 30 below.
Thermometers read 31 below Monday in Glasgow, Mont., and the wind chill was 45 below, the Weather Service said. The Texas Panhandle had lows in the single digits, and Goodland, Kan., registered a record low of minus 10.
Record lows Monday included 19 below zero in Denver, where the previous Dec. 15 record of minus 6 was set in 1951; and minus 16 at Sidney, Neb.
Working around the clock
In the Northeast, hundreds of utility crews from as far away as South Carolina worked through the weekend to turn on the lights — and more important, power to furnaces and wells — to New Hampshire customers, leaving 168,000 still without electricity. At its peak, the number of power failures in the state was about 430,000.
Outside temperatures soared above 50 degrees, making it warmer outside than inside some dark apartments and houses.
In Portland, Maine, the city hit a record high for the day at 56 degrees Monday just four days after the storm knocked out power to 220,000 residents. Central Maine Power said about 30,000 homes and businesses were still in the dark Monday morning, and a spokesman said it expected to have power restored Wednesday.
The warming weather and wind created more problems in New York as tree limbs snapped back in place after ice melted off, said New York Gov. David Paterson.
Paterson and Sen. Charles Schumer said they were seeking a federal emergency declaration for 16 counties hit by the storm. About 77,000 customers in eastern New York still lacked power Monday, and utilities said it could be Wednesday before almost all customers get their power back.
A long wait for power
In Derry, N.H., Tom Guyette was one of three residents of his eight-unit apartment house still sticking it out. The disabled Marine veteran said they were using a propane heater and a gas grill outside to make coffee, boiled eggs and Spam.
"We're still manning the fort. We haven't been relieved of our duties, so we ain't leavin' yet," he said. "There's a lot more people that have a lot less than we do, so for us to take spaces where women and children could be is wrong."
The wait will be much longer for others, such as Meredith Lund, spokeswoman for the New Hampshire town of New Ipswich. She said the utility company estimated power would not be restored to the town for about two weeks.
So far, President George W. Bush has declared states of emergency in New Hampshire, Maine and nine of Massachusetts' 14 counties, directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide relief assistance.
In Vermont, Gov. Jim Douglas was declaring the state's four southern counties disaster areas. About 6,300 customers were still without power Monday morning, said the Central Vermont Public Service Corp. and Green Mountain Power. Officials there estimated it could be the middle of the week before all customers have their power back.""" ;

<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29899296> dct:description """A major spring blizzard plodding eastward over the Southern Plains shut down major highways and paralyzed the region as residents braced Friday for up to a foot of snow, freezing 45 mph winds and massive snowdrifts.
Schools and government offices were closed and hundreds of travelers were stranded by the storm, which left some areas in a coat of ice. The snowfall was expected to be unprecedented for this time of year in Oklahoma, and the National Guard was called out in the Texas Panhandle, where snowdrifts as high as 11 feet were predicted before the storm moves on Saturday.
"It's blowing furiously," said Jerry Billington of Faith City Ministries in downtown Amarillo, which was under whiteout conditions. The 200-bed shelter was one of several setting up extra beds and encouraging homeless people to come in off the street.
There were several accidents in the area, including jackknifed tractor-trailers, Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Wayne Williams said in Amarillo, which is about 365 miles northwest of Dallas. Authorities shut down all major highways around Dalhart in the northwest corner of the Panhandle.
Ice built up all over southeast Kansas on Friday, with a quarter-inch coat reported in Arkansas City. Freezing rain pelted the Wichita area, and heavy snow and 40 mph winds created dangerous driving conditions in the Dodge City area.
16 inches of snow in places
The weather service forecast as much as 16 inches of snow in northwest Oklahoma, with about 5 inches predicted in Oklahoma City. Gov. Brad Henry declared a state of emergency Friday for much of the state.
Winds were strongest near the Colorado-Kansas border, said Randy Gray of the National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colo. Sections of three southeast Colorado highways totaling nearly 150 miles were shut down Friday.
Rural electric providers reported about 5,000 homes and businesses without power in Oklahoma, where wind gusts were as high as 50 mph. More than 2,000 Oklahoma Gas and Electric customers in the Norman area were without power Friday.
Earlier in the week the storm dumped nearly a foot and a half of snow in the Denver area, creating havoc at airports and on highways that lingered Friday as a swatch of far southeastern Colorado remained under a blizzard warning. Many schools and offices remained closed because of icy roads and unplowed streets.
Three of four roads into the southeast Colorado town of Springfield were closed when blowing snow reduced visibility to near zero.
"It was awful. Just blowing real bad," said Kelly Mason, a worker at Love's Travel Stop in the town of about 1,400. "Not a lot's moving around here."
Hundreds spent night at airport
As many as 400 travelers spent the night at Denver International Airport after airlines canceled about 500 flights Thursday. Air operations resumed Friday, with dominant DIA carriers United, Southwest and Frontier airlines returning to regular schedules with few cancellations.
Eastern Colorado ranchers checked on their herds, which were in the midst of calving when the storm hit.
A series of heavy storms in December 2006 and January 2007 killed an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 head of cattle in southeastern Colorado. Cattle that survived gave birth to stillborn calves because of the stressful winter, compounding losses.
This week's storm will "have some impact, but it wasn't what we call a cow-killer," said Mike Eisenbart, who has 140 head of cattle on his ranch in Kit Carson County about 140 miles east of Denver.
Gov. Bill Ritter declared a state of emergency Thursday and activated the National Guard. Troops rescued three stranded motorists and cleared a path through stalled vehicles for an emergency blood delivery, Capt. Elena O'Bryan said.""" ;

<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/colorado-loss-reveals-chaotic-overwhelmed-trump-campaign-n552781> dct:description """ARVADA, Colo. — Colorado is not going well for Donald Trump.
After a shake-up at the top this week in which Trump empowered Paul Manafort to manage the campaign’s troubled delegate operation, Sen. Ted Cruz swept a third straight Congressional District convention Thursday night. All three delegates selected were listed on a slate put forward by the Cruz campaign.
Trump aides concede that Colorado is not a promising state, but the level of disorganization at Thursday’s event suggested problems that ran deeper than the top-line results.
"[Trump's] our only hope against Hillary, that lying crooked witch"
Addressing the audience, Trump’s new Colorado state director Patrick Davis told supporters to vote for the three pro-Trump delegate candidates on a glossy brochure the campaign distributed.
“Look for them on the back when you vote Donald Trump!” Davis said. “He’s going to make America great again!”
There was only one problem: Two of the three names weren’t listed on the ballot.
“That’s a good question,” Davis told reporters after his speech when asked why they were left off.
There were, however, three pro-Trump delegates on the ballot who weren’t sanctioned by the campaign. One of them, Cully Marshall, made his case for Trump in a poem.
"He's our only hope against Hillary, that lying crooked witch,” Marshall said. “He's going to build that wall and make Hillary El Chapo's personal…” He trailed off.
After some digging, Davis returned with a solution to the mystery of the missing delegates. One of the delegates had failed to pay the necessary fee to get on the ballot. He assumed the other was left off for similar reasons.
“Administrative error,” he said.
To be fair to Davis, who is a veteran operative in the state, he didn’t have much time to get the campaign up to speed. He only joined Tuesday, right as a Trump aide assigned to the state, James Baker, was let go by the campaign. By the time he showed up for work, Cruz had already swept the six delegates in two Congressional District convention sover the last week.
In some ways, Thursday’s performance was an improvement: The campaign didn’t even distribute brochures with delegate slates in those two events.
“Honestly, we didn’t have this level of sophistication last weekend,” Davis said, explaining the previous lack of flyers. “Had we, it might have been a different result.”
Related: Infighting, Frustration Rile Trump Campaign, Sources Say
Helbis Varangot, the one official Trump backer on the ballot for delegate, had plenty of complaints about the way the campaign handled the run-up to the event.
"They haven't been here in Colorado," she said. "[Baker] disappointed all of us. He didn't do what he was supposed to do so he got fired. He told the campaign he was organizing, he never set foot in Colorado as far as I can tell."
A source close to the campaign said Baker, who was also working on efforts in other states, was in Colorado at the time of his firing.
The Cruz campaign, in stark contrast to Trump’s operation, showed up ready to roll with a slate of six favored supporters, three delegates and three alternates.
Regina Thompson, Cruz’s grassroots director in the state, said she began organizing for the campaign eight months ago in anticipation of the convention and helped secure delegates to the state and district conventions at the March 1 caucuses.
“The process is what the process is — seeking out supporters, getting people to attend caucuses, texts, emails, one-on-ones,” she said.
Cruz’s state effort was driven entirely by volunteers, but the campaign used robo-polls to identify prospective supporters for its delegate slate. Cruz will address the state convention in person on Saturday.
Advisers to Trump argue that the lack of focus on Colorado is a strategic decision, given that the state’s political lean and complicated convention process favors Cruz.
“If we get a delegate number higher than zero it will be a success,” Alan Cobb, a Trump adviser focused on delegate strategy, told NBC News. “It’s just not a good state for us.”
The campaign changed its schedule this week to cut out a planned appearance by Trump in Colorado in order to focus on padding delegate margin in states like New York, which votes April 19, and neighboring states like Connecticut and New Jersey.
“We’re trying to make an effort commensurate with what we expect to get out of here,” Cobb said of Colorado.
The Kasich campaign had a visible presence on Thursday and Andrew Boucher, a chief convention strategist, addressed the crowd on his behalf. Kasich supporter John Sununu is touring the state as well.
“Cruz and Kasich have been incredibly visible, especially in the last 10 days,” Colorado GOP chairman Steve House said. “The Trump campaign, not nearly as much.”""" ;

<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/cruz-sweeps-colorado-trump-campaign-issues-error-filled-ballots-n553586> dct:description """COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado — Sen. Ted Cruz finished Colorado’s delegate fight the way he started it: With overwhelming victory.
Donald Trump finished it the way he started as well: With a disorganized and frustrated campaign plagued by mistakes.
Cruz took all 13 of the delegates up for grabs on Saturday to complete a clean sweep of the state. Delegates endorsed by his campaign swept all seven congressional district conventions held over the last week as well, which added another 21 delegates. Another three slots are reserved for state party officials.
"Today was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country," the Cruz campaign said in a statement Saturday night.
Trump’s aides set expectations at rock bottom heading into Saturday’s contest, citing the state’s unfavorable demographics and a complicated process that empowers local party activists to vote on delegates.
Supporters in Colorado nonetheless said they were frustrated with the campaign’s chaotic and uncommunicative campaign, which failed to reach basic levels of competence.
"We could have had some things going, but the campaign decided to not put resources here," Becky Mizel, a former Pueblo County GOP chair and Trump delegate candidate, told NBC News.

On Saturday, Trump backers passed out flyers at the convention site with official campaign slate of 13 delegates and 13 alternates accompanied by their three-digit number position on the 600-plus person ballot. Seven of the names, however, directed people to the wrong number and one delegate’s name was misspelled. Other candidates did not have errors on their slates.
In one case, an erroneous number corresponded with a Cruz supporter. A second flyer handed out by the Trump campaign contained four mismatched names and numbers.
Among the names listed incorrectly on both flyers: Becky Mizel.
Related: Bernie Sanders Wins Wyoming Democratic Caucuses
It was the second major error concerning campaign materials this week. On Thursday, a Trump slate of three names in the 7th Congressional District convention contained two that weren’t listed on the ballot. The campaign’s state director, Patrick Davis, said they failed to pay the necessary fees to qualify.
Trump’s campaign wasn’t the only one who made mistakes, though. Colorado Republican chairman Steve House announced several corrections to the ballot from the stage, including multiple names that were on the ballot twice, none of which affected any candidate’s official slate. One Trump alternate, Jerome Parks, was not on the numbers-only ballot at #379 — instead the ballot listed #378 twice.
"They’re not in there!" Trump supporter Karen Kasel said to herself in frustration as she tried to find #379 on her ballot in the hallway.

There were also discrepancies between delegate guides posted to the state party’s website and printed materials distributed by the state GOP. Mizel, for example, was listed on a delegate list on the party website as number #610, but a brochure from the state GOP listing delegates alphabetically cut off at #588.
Trump campaign aide Alan Cobb accused the Colorado GOP of altering its delegate lists at different points, leaving them in the lurch as it changed, and threatened to dispute the results over its ballot inconsistencies.
"We'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado," Cobb told NBC News. "Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.
A spokesman for the Colorado GOP said they were looking into the matter.
In another mix-up, the party’s Twitter account appeared to be hacked in the aftermath of the results, tweeting "We did it. #NeverTrump." A spokesman for the party said that their account had been taken over and the tweet was not authorized.
Cruz’s all-volunteer Colorado campaign distributed accurate slates not only on flyers, but also on bright orange t-shirts. Groups like Gun Owners of America that endorsed Cruz distributed their own materials backing the same slate.
Dustin Olson, a delegate whip for Cruz, manned a “persuasion team” in the halls of the arena. The heavily pro-Cruz crowd needed little convincing, Olson said, but he worked hard to make sure no one split the vote by supporting Cruz delegates who weren’t on the campaign’s official slate.
Cruz personally addressed the state convention on Saturday while Trump campaign and Ohio Governor John Kasich supplied campaign surrogates on their behalf.
“It’s easy to talk about making America great again, you can even print that on a baseball cap,” Cruz said. “The real question is do you understand the principles and values that made America great in the first place?”
Afterwards Cruz told NBC affiliate KUSA that Trump’s absence “illustrates that when it comes to the grassroots, Donald has a very hard time competing.”
Speaking on behalf of Trump, policy adviser Stephen Miller devoted nearly all his remarks to recounting Americans who had been killed by undocumented immigrants.
"We smoked them"
“The special interests in DC who have controlled our political process for 40 years, they don’t care about you, they don’t care about your family, and they don’t care about your security,” Miller said.
Former New Hampshire Senator John Sununu represented Kasich, who he described as “tough,” “conservative” and a “fighter” who was willing to take on his own party to balance the budget in the 1990s.
The Colorado results come as the race increasingly hinges on a complex war over delegate selection that requires foresight and grassroots organization to win.
Unlike Colorado, most of these fights are taking place in states where voters have already weighed in on how many delegates are bound to each candidate, but where the state party has a separate process for choosing the actual delegates.

The results are crucial because most delegates are free to vote for any candidate they choose in a contested convention that goes beyond the first ballot.
Several states held delegate selection events on Saturday, with Cruz’s campaign continuing his string of success in most cases but falling prey to a surprise alliance between Trump and Kasich in one state.
In Iowa, Cruz supporters nearly swept up each of Iowa’s 12 national delegate slots up for grabs. Each of Iowa’s four congressional districts voted to send three delegates to the convention in Cleveland, and all but one of those 12 delegates committed to backing Cruz on a second ballot if the race comes down to a contested convention at July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
“We smoked them,” said Matt Schultz, Cruz’s campaign chair in the state.
The Trump campaign — despite the results — pushed back on suggestions they amounted to a loss for the candidate.
“It was definitely obvious Ted's camp thought they’d come in and clean up and sweep the whole slate of delegates, so I consider it a Trump victory for the Trump campaign,” said Tana Goertz, who led Trump’s efforts in the state after chairing his caucus efforts. "We were just happy the full slate wasn’t filled with all Cruz people.”
Meanwhile in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District — which Trump won with 47% of the vote — Cruz supporters took two delegate slots to one for Trump.
In South Carolina — where all delegates are bound to Trump on the first ballot — Cruz secured three delegate seats out of six up for grabs in two districts on Saturday while Trump won just one. Two more were uncommitted.
In Michigan, though, Trump and Kasich supporters appeared to team up to deny Cruz any spots on the important convention committees that will determine rules and credentials for delegates. Trump supporters took five of eight slots, while Kasich supporters took the other three.""" ;

But they will reappraise its severity when the final insurance bill is determined.Severe weather meteorologist Tony Wedd said the storm was large and unusual because it hit Brisbane suburbs such as The Gap, Ferny Grove and Keperra, areas that did not often get big storms."It would have been a real eye-opener for people living out there," he said. "It's not like Esk or Gatton, which are used to being hit by storms like this."It was really a line of storms that covered the northern suburbs. Cells waxed and waned, which is why you've got different pockets of damage, as cells reached peak intensity."Forecaster Geoff Doueal said between 10 and 20 storms formed across the southeast from the hinterland ranges after temperatures soared into the 30s and humidity rose to the high 90s."Storms were popping up all over the place and then dying until they finally formed a line of squalls," he said. "The one that hit the northside was very dangerous. There were lightning strikes all over the place."Queensland Parks and Wildlife regional manager Jason Jacobi said extensive damage had been done to reserves in Brisbane's western and northern suburbs and on the Gold Coast hinterland, including Brisbane Forest Park, Samford State Forest, Bunyaville Forest Reserve and D'Aguilar Range including Mt Mee State Forest, Lamington and Springbrook national parks.Energex, Brisbane City Council and State Emergency Service crews worked through Sunday night and all day yesterday to clear a path through the debris.The SES took more than 15,000 calls and sent crews to more than 100 households to help out with sand-bagging and repairing damaged roofs and windows.The Gap's Betty Conlon said she was humbled by the number of people who stopped to help clear branches from her driveway and footpath."People just came from everywhere. They were wonderful. One man worked for hours and then went home to clean up his own yard," Mrs Conlon said.At The Gap State High School nearby, sheets of tin roofing hung from trees and branches covered every square metre of open space.The local primary school was even harder hit, with fallen trees demolishing the playground and damaging the near-new multi-purpose building.Lord Mayor Campbell Newman said 300 staff and 100 vehicles had been deployed, along with crews from Logan and Redland city councils and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.""" ;

The bodies of two adults were found outside close to a shed that had been converted into a residence, while five were discovered inside. All the victims appeared to have gunshot wounds, said police.
Victims have been named as Katrina Miles, with her four children aged from eight to 13 years old. They have been named by as Take, 13, Rylan, 11, Arye, 10, and Kadyn, 8, The Daily Telegraph reports.
Katrina’s parents, Cynda and Peter Miles are listed as owners of the property and are also believed to have lived there.
MORE: Inside slain family’s idyllic retreat
The incident is the worst mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre of 1996 when 35 people died and 23 were seriously injured.
A “male person” connected to the property called police early on Friday morning. It is believed the triple-0 call was made by the killer, a man who is among the dead.
The force have since described what they found as a “horrific tragedy” and are treating it as a murder suicide.
Only a month ago, Ms Miles claimed on her Facebook page that: “My ex does not stop stalking me” according to The Australian.
News.com.au has seen a social media post from someone who knew the family which said: “Lovely people, but crazy ex-husband”.
In a Facebook post on her own page, Ms Miles described herself as the “parent of four beautiful children”.
It’s understood all four kids had autism and were homeschooled. Friends described her as a mother absolutely devoted to her children.
“I always admired her for her strength. The kids were kind, gentle, smart and beautiful children,” said one friend.
Cynda Miles had a craft business called Soft Salvage where she made decorative goods from recycled materials. Peter Miles was a farm maintenance worker.
He was seemingly well thought of in the community with a post on a farmer’s social media page praising his work. “Peter is THE man for any farm job”.
Police have yet to publicly identify the victims.
HOUSE A ‘PIECE OF PARADISE’
Cynda and Peter Miles bought the property on Osmington Road in late 2014 for $820,000 according to RP Data. Osmington is mostly rural, made up of vineyards and farmland properties.
At the time, the 30 acres plus two houses was described as a “piece of paradise” by the real estate agents and the “tree change you’ve been waiting for”.
“It’s not too big, not too small ... with a native bush boundary giving you privacy and protection from the elements. It truly is one of the best hobby farms in the Margaret River area.”
The property includes two residences, a main open plan house with a second smaller home.
When sold, the agents said the owners has “10 head of cattle, chooks, geese and a pig called George.”
POLICE: “DEVASTATING” DISCOVERY
Police told news.com.au on Friday evening that the process of formally identifying the deceased has progressed and homicide detectives and forensic offers are on the scene.
“There is no information to suggest any ongoing threat to the broader community.”
Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said police received a call at 5.15am Friday from a “male person” connected to the property. When they arrived, they found seven bodies. Two firearms were discovered at the property
Mr Dawson described the discovery as “devastating”.
“This is going to have an enormous effect on young people in the community.”
The Premier of Western Australia, Mark McGowan tweeted about the incident, saying the events were “tragic and shocking”.

Osmington local Meg Janes, 68, said it wasn’t unusual to hear gun shots as kangaroos were often culled.
“Something woke me up around 4am. I heard quite a few gunshots and I thought, ‘That’s a bit strange, that’s an odd hour to be shooting kangaroos’,” she told Perth Now.
“It wasn’t until I saw the police that I thought, ‘Hang on a minute’.
“(The shots) were separated out, there was quite a long gap between them. It wasn’t one after another.”
Neighbour Richard Dosser told the ABC he had spoken to someone who lived in the house who worked as a farm maintenance worker.
“I was talking to him on the phone last night, I was going to ask him to come over tomorrow,” he said. “He seemed very vague.”
The events in our South West are tragic and shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims, and also with the first responders and investigators as they piece together this tragic set of circumstances. — Mark McGowan (@MarkMcGowanMP) May 11, 2018
The Shire President of Augusta-Margaret River, Pam Townsend said what had happened was surreal.
“It’s surreal that this is happening here in our beautiful little community.
“When we hear of violence like this, it is just shocking. We really need to talk about violence, don’t we, in our society.
Police Commissioner Dawson said the incident had taken its toll on first responders.
“This is an horrific tragedy for any person involved and, clearly, officers and other first responders attending these sort of scenes, they find it tragic. We will get on with our job but, regrettably, these tragedies do take their toll on everyone,” he said.
In a statement, Western Australian Police said officers were expected to remain at the home for “an extended period of time”.

Ahmedabad , Wed, 29 Aug 2012 ANI
Ahmedabad, Aug 29 (ANI) Congress party leader Digvijay Singh on Wednesday welcomed the verdict in Naroda Patiya massacre case, saying that it has proved the role of BJP leaders in post-Godhra riots and claimed that the pogrom was carried out with support of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
"Now it is proved that ministers and officials of BJP were involved in Gujarat riots and all this happened under the guidance of Modi...can any minister (take part in riots) do this without the support of the Chief Minister?" asked Digvijay.
Digvijay also strongly pitched for the need to probe the role of Modi.
A trial court in Ahmedabad on Wednesday convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 others in the Naroda Patiya massacre case which took place during the 2002 Gujarat riots.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Naroda, Maya Kodnani, and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi, too, have been convicted in the case.
Kodnani, who is the first BJP leader to be convicted in a riot case, was the sitting MLA when the massacre in which 97 people were killed on February 28, 2002 took place.
Kodnani and Bajrangi have been convicted under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder).
The Naroda Patiya massacre is the largest single case of mass murder during the 2002 Gujarat riots that broke out following the Sabarmati Express train carnage near Godhra station.
The case has been probed by a Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigating Team (SIT). (ANI)""" ;

<http://www.newwest.net/city/article/nations_largest_sitka_spruce_dies_in_oregon/C509/L509/> dct:description """So just how powerful is the storm currently raging its way across Oregon?
Well, among many other means of destruction, it’s strong enough to rip down the nation’s largest Sitka spruce tree. The Oregon Department of Forestry reports that the 206-foot tree in Klootchy Creek County Park, also known as “Klootchy,” has indeed tumbled to its death.
According to Paul Ries at ODF, the 700-year-old spruce snapped about 75 feet from the ground. In perhaps the most poignant quote ever, Ries simply says: “The tree will now die.”
Let’s take a look at a few things that have happened to the environment during the span of this great tree’s life:
– 1347 to 1350s — The Bubonic plague kills one third to 75% of the populations of Europe and Asia, creating the first attempts to enforce public health and quarantine laws. And to think, Klootchy was no thicker than a femur back then.
– 1666 — Japan government officials warn against dangers of erosion, stream situation and flooding caused by deforestation. A follow-up proclamation urges people to plant tree seedlings. Now a handsome youngster, Klootchy sent much love across the Pacific for this one.
– 1804 — Lewis and Clark expedition begins their journey West. Upon reaching the Columbia River and ultimately the Oregon coast, the party spent a miserable winter sheltered no more than 50 miles from the now deceased Klootchy.
– 1852 — A giant sequoia tree 300 feet high, 92 feet in circumference and an estimated 2,500 years old is cut down in what will eventually become Yosemite National Park for display in carnival sideshows. The New York Tribune calls the act “vandalism” and “villainous speculation.” At least Klootchy was able to die a natural death.
– 1879 — Division of Forestry established in US, which later became known as the US Forest Service. Since its inception, it’s been a love-and-hate relationship between Oregon trees and the Forest Service. Private timber sale, anyone?
– 1955 — Congress passes the Air Pollution Control Act. Now a wily veteran of the planet, Klootchy dreams of clean air and consistent temperatures. And then Al Gore had to come along and break his heart.
– 1970 — The first nationwide Earth Day is celebrated. Cool, maybe the television will be good for something. Like telling couch potatoes that it’s freaking’ Earth Day!
– 1990 — United Nations report warns that global temperatures are on the rise. Report recommends reducing CO2 emissions worldwide. Umm… yeah.
– 2001 — Bill Clinton moves out of the White House with more than 58 million acres of national forest protected from development that weren‘t prior to his election. Among the lands protected is the forest Klootchy called home. Thank you spotted owl!
– 2003 — Bush Administration strives to abolish or least weaken the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the toxic waste Superfund, the Right to Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and several others. Klootchy says, “wait a minute?”
– 2007 — Dec. 3 — Klootchy meets his demise courtesy of a violent winter storm pouring off the Pacific. It was a fine life, dear tree, a fine life indeed.

<http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-died-at-altamont> dct:description """It had been a while since I’d seen “Gimme Shelter,” one of the early classics of the Maysles brothers, Albert and David, and I watched it again on the occasion of the passing of Albert Maysles last Thursday. To my surprise, I found that a big part of the story of “Gimme Shelter” is in the end credits, which say that the movie was filmed by “the Maysles Brothers and (in alphabetical order)” the names of twenty-two more camera operators. By way of contrast, the brothers’ previous feature, “Salesman,” credited “photography” solely to Albert Maysles, and “Grey Gardens,” from 1976, was “filmed by” Albert Maysles and David Maysles. The difference is drastic: it’s the distinction between newsgathering and relationships, and relationships are what the Maysleses built their films on.
Photograph by Mary Evans/Everett
The Maysleses virtually lived with the Bible peddlers on the road, they virtually inhabited Grey Gardens with Big Edie and Little Edie, but—as Michael Sragow reports in this superb study, from 2000, on the making of “Gimme Shelter”—the Maysleses didn’t and couldn’t move in with the Rolling Stones. Stan Goldstein, a Maysles associate, told Sragow, “In the film there are virtually no personal moments with the Stones—the Maysles were not involved with the Stones’ lives. They did not have unlimited access. It was an outside view.”
It’s a commonplace to consider the documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman’s films to be centered on the lives of institutions and those of the Maysleses to be centered on the lives of people, but “Gimme Shelter” does both. Though it’s replete with some exhilarating concert footage—notably, of the Stones performing on the concert tour that led up to the Altamont disaster—its central subject is how the Altamont concert came into being. “Gimme Shelter” is a film about a concert that is only incidentally a concert film. Yet the Maysleses’ vision of the unfolding events is distinctive—and, for that matter, historic—by virtue of their distinctive directorial procedure.
Early on, Charlie Watts, the Stones drummer, is seen in the editing room, watching footage with David Maysles, who tells him that it will take eight weeks to edit the film. Watts asks whether Maysles thinks he can do it in that time, and Maysles answers, waving his arm to indicate the editing room, “This gives us the freedom, you guys watching it.”
Filming in the editing room (which, Sragow reports, was the idea of Charlotte Zwerin, one of the film’s editors and directors, who had joined the project after the rest of the shoot) gave them the freedom to break from the strict chronology of the concert season that went from New York to Altamont while staying within the participatory logic of their direct-cinema program. It’s easy to imagine another filmmaker using a voice-over and a montage to introduce, at the start, the fatal outcome of the Altamont concert and portentously declare the intention to follow the band on their American tour to see how they reached that calamitous result. The Maysleses, repudiating such ex-cathedra interventions, instead create a new, and newly personal, sphere of action for the Stones and themselves that the filmmakers can use to frame the concert footage.
The editing-room sequences render the concert footage archival, making it look like what it is—in effect, found footage of a historical event. The result is to turn the impersonal archive personal and to give the Maysles brothers, as well as the Rolling Stones, a personal implication in even the documentary images that they themselves didn’t film.
Among those images are those of a press conference where Mick Jagger announced his plans for a free concert and his intentions in holding it, which are of a worthy and progressive cast: “It’s creating a microcosmic society which sets examples for the rest of America as to how one can behave at large gatherings.” (Later, though, he frames it in more demotic terms: “The concert is an excuse for everyone to talk to each other, get together, sleep with each other, hold each other, and get very stoned.”)
A strange convergence of interests appears in negotiations filmed by the Maysleses between the attorney Melvin Belli, acting on the Stones’ behalf; Dick Carter, the owner of the Altamont Speedway; and other local authorities. The intense pressure to make the concert happen is suggested in a radio broadcast from the day before the concert, during which the announcer Frank Terry snarks that “apparently it’s one of the most difficult things in the world to give a free concert.” The Stones want to perform; their fans want to see them perform a free concert; the local government wants to deliver that show and not to stand in its way; Belli wants to facilitate it; and the Stones don’t exactly renounce their authority in the process but do, in revealing moments, lay bare to the Maysleses’ cameras their readiness to engage with a mighty system of which they themselves aren’t quite the masters.
Within this convergence of rational interests, one element is overlooked: madness. Jagger approaches the concert with constructive purpose and festive enthusiasm, but he performs like a man possessed, singing with fury of a crossfire hurricane and warning his listeners that to play with him is to play with fire. No, what happened at Altamont is not the music’s fault. Celebrity was already a scene of madness in Frank Sinatra’s first flush of fame and when the Beatles were chased through the train station in “A Hard Day’s Night.” But the Beatles’ celebrity was, almost from the start, their subject as well as their object, and they approached it and managed it with a Warholian consciousness, as in their movies; they managed their music in the same way and became, like Glenn Gould, concert dropouts. By contrast, the Stones were primal and natural performers, whose music seemed to thrive, even to exist, in contact with the audience. That contact becomes the movie’s subject—a subject that surpasses the Rolling Stones and enters into history at large.
The Maysleses and Zwerin intercut the discussions between Belli, Carter, and the authorities with concert footage from the Stones’ other venues along the way. The effect—the music running as the nighttime preparations for the Altamont concert occur, with fires and headlights, a swirling tumult—suggests the forces about to be unleashed on the world at large. A cut from a moment in concert to a helicopter shot of an apocalyptic line of cars winding through the hills toward Altamont and of the crowd already gathered there suggests that something wild has escaped from the closed confines of the Garden and other halls. The Maysleses’ enduring theme of the absent boundary between theatre and life, between show and reality, is stood on its head: art as great as that of the Stones is destined to have a mighty real-world effect. There’s a reason why the crucial adjective for art is “powerful”; it’s ultimately forced to engage with power as such.
What died at Altamont was the notion of spontaneity, of the sense that things could happen on their own and that benevolent spirits would prevail. What ended was the idea of the unproduced. What was born there was infrastructure—the physical infrastructure of facilities, the abstract one of authority. From that point on, concerts were the tip of the iceberg, the superstructure, the mere public face and shining aftermath of elaborate planning. The lawyers and the insurers, the politicians and the police, security consultants and fire-safety experts—the masters and mistresses of management—would be running the show.
The movie ends with concertgoers the morning after, walking away, their backs to the viewer, leaving a blank natural realm of earth and sky; they’re leaving the state of nature and heading back to the city, from which they’ll never be able to leave innocently again. What emerges accursed is the very idea of nature, of the idea that, left to their own inclinations and stripped of the trappings of the wider social order, the young people of the new generation will somehow spontaneously create a higher, gentler, more loving grassroots order. What died at Altamont is the Rousseauian dream itself. What was envisioned in “Lord of the Flies” and subsequently dramatized in such films as “Straw Dogs” and “Deliverance” was presented in reality in “Gimme Shelter.” The haunting freeze-frame on Jagger staring into the camera, at the end of the film, after his forensic examination of the footage of the killing of Meredith Hunter at the concert, reveals not the filmmakers’ accusation or his own sense of guilt but lost illusions.""" ;

<http://www.nola.com/crime/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2015/07/louisiana_theater_shooter_john.html#incart_story_package> dct:description """Neighbors remember John Russell Houser as a recluse with bizarre behaviors, who was often seen in the yard of his Phenix City, Ala., home working on his yard or working on one of the vehicles he kept on blocks.
"I don't think he worked [outside the home]," neighbor Rick Chancey said. "He was home all of the time."
Neighbors along 32nd Street were surprised when they woke up Friday morning and learned Houser, whom they knew as Rusty, had opened fire in a Lafayette, La., movie theater, killing two and injuring nine before turning the gun on himself.
Knowing some of his history though, they weren't shocked.
Chancey said several years ago Houser placed a manifesto of sorts in his mailbox.
"It was just kind of odd," he recalled, saying the homemade flyer alluded to the end of days and how everyone needed to conserve and share resources.
Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said Houser was denied a permit to carry a concealed weapon by his office in 2006 due to a domestic violence report filed by Houser's then-wife in 2005. Houser was never arrested for domestic violence or for anything else in Phenix City or Russell County, Taylor said. Houser was arrested in Columbus in 1989 or 1990 for arson, but a grand jury failed to indict him. Houser did seek treatment for a mental illness in Phenix City from 2008-09, but he didn't know what he was being treated for.
Norman Bone, who bought Houser's 32nd Street home at a public auction in February 2014, knew Rusty for 20-25 years. He went to church with Houser and his former wife, Kellie, at Eastern Heights Baptist Church in Columbus, Ga.
Bone remembered him as a "fine guy, a good guy," he said, while recalling that Houser even preached one night at the church.
Houser is a graduate of Columbus High School and Columbus State University.
Houser's church-going, normal-guy-image changed, though, when the Bones tried to take possession of Houser's which he bought for his daughter, Beth, and her boyfriend, Dan Ramsell.
Understandably, Houser was upset and angry over losing his house to foreclosure.
The Bones, though, said Houser's actions went beyond that. They were the actions of a madman.
Houser tried his hardest to destroy the house, the Bones said.
He tried to blow up the house by leaving the gas on and shutting off all of the vents, neighbors recalled.
Buckets containing human feces were placed inside the house, the Bones said. Purple paint was splattered throughout the interior and the exterior. The bathroom and kitchen drains were filled with concrete and the pool was filled with more than 300 Koi fish, they said.
Taylor confirmed much of the Bones' account of vandalism done to their home by Houser. He said a report was filed, but Houser was never arrested. Norman Bone said he awoke to his telephone ringing early this morning. It was the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanting to search Houser's former home. Bone met a Phenix City police officer at 3:14 a.m. and handed over the keys. As far as he knows, police didn't find anything.
Today, Norman Bone said his heart goes out to Houser's mom, Ruth, and his brother, Rem, and the family of those who lost their lives in Louisiana.
But he is thankful today.
"He could just as easily took it out on us," Norman Bone said.
As she prepares to move into Houser's former home after months of cleanup, Beth said: "I am glad that I am not going to be scared to now.\"""" ;

Julia "Morgan" Egedahl was the last victim who was hospitalized after the July 23 to be released.
Our Lady of Lourdes said in a news release Egedahl, 33, was released at 4:39 p.m. after 23 days in the hospital. The night of the shooting, the hospital said Egedahl immediately brought into surgery where doctors operated on six gunshot wounds.
She suffered serious fractures, lower abdominal injuries and damage to her lung, according to Our Lady of Lourdes. She had two surgeries, hours of rehab and "lots of love and support."
Egedahl was among 11 people shot – two fatally – inside the Grand 16 on Johnson Street. John Russell Houser, 59, opened fire about 20 minutes in to a showing of the movie "Trainwreck."
He killed Mayci Breaux, 21, and Jillian Johnson, 33, and injured nine others before he killed himself.
In a statement released by the hospital, Egedahl called Johnson her friend, and thanked the community for their support.
"Ten years ago, my friend of 24 years, Jillian Johnson, encouraged me to come make this special place called Lafayette my home," she said. "While this has been an unimaginable event in my life, I remain amazed by the people of this community.

<http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/louisiana_congressional_member_4.html> dct:description """WASHINGTON – Louisiana members of Congress responded to the Lafayette theater shooting with calls for prayer.
Here is a sampling:
Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette: "I'm saddened at the terrible loss of life represented in tonight's tragic shooting at a movie theater in my hometown of Lafayette. Bridget and I are praying for the families and friends of the victims at this difficult time. I will work with the Lafayette Police Department, local, state, and federal officials to get to the bottom of what happened tonight."
Sen. David Vitter, R-La.: "Wendy, the kids, and I certainly join so many others in our continuing love and prayers for all of those affected by this horrible and senseless violence. As a community, we must serve as a source of strength and support for the victims' families in particular."
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.: "Lafayette is a close community. I cannot describe the sadness Laura and I feel today for the victims, their families and the entire community. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. In a moment of fear and tragedy, Louisianans put their own safety at risk to help their fellow citizens. First responders acted quickly and bravely and saved lives. The heroism in Lafayette will always be remembered."
Rep. John Fleming, R-Minden: "My wife, Cindy, and I were horrified to hear of the senseless shooting in Louisiana. Our prayers are with the victims recovering, and family members of those that died. I do however praise the quick actions taken by the first responders, as well as civilians in the theater, to ensure the tragedy didn't escalate further. While investigators look into why this incident happened, I ask that you join me in prayer for all those involved."
But Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said prayers aren't enough.
"There are too many families who again today will struggle to comprehend how such horrors could have happened," she said. "They join the many thousands who suffer silently as Congress does nothing to stop the swelling of their ranks. "They'll listen to the politicians preach of the heroism of those who risked their own lives to save others, but they won't see similar courage from enough leaders in Washington or in the state houses.
"Early reports are that the shooter in Lafayette had a criminal background. As with all shootings, we should immediately investigate how he obtained a weapon in the first place, and work to make sure others with criminal backgrounds cannot do the same. In all likelihood, however, these shots that were fired will again fall on deaf ears in the Capitol. Shame on this Congress for continuing to sit still as our people are maimed and killed in the streets, churches, military bases and movie theaters. This has got to stop."
Another voice from outside Louisiana, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Ct., who pushed for gun control after the shooting to death of 20 first graders and six educators at a Connecticut elementary school in 2012:
"I'm praying for the victims, their loved ones, and the entire Lafayette community as they begin to try to understand and cope with the realities of last night's tragic shooting. Another community has been changed forever. More mothers, more fathers, more brothers and sisters, friends, and loved ones must now bear the grueling pain and grief of gun violence. We're going to figure out what went wrong and how this happened, and I'm committed to taking every necessary step to prevent this from happening again; I hope Congress is ready to join me."

The shooting victims include Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48.
Three of the other victims are not being named at this time pending next-of-kin notification.
"We're still early in this investigation," says Texas County Sheriff James Sigman. "We still have family and people to talk to. We're not going to have all the answers today."
The elderly woman found dead in a home is identified as Alice L. Aldridge. Police say she died of natural causes, but a post mortem examination is scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 28.
The gunman is identified Joseph Jesse Aldridge, 36, of Tyrone. He is the son of Alice Aldridge and is believed to be a cousin of the victims.
Joseph Aldridge was found dead in neighboring Shannon County of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Police were alerted just after 10 p.m. Thursday after a young girl heard gunshots in her home on Highway H and ran to the neighbors to call for help. That neighbor tells KOLR10 News the girl showed up barefoot and crying, and said her mother and father had been shot.
Five other victims were later discovered in three more homes within a three-mile radius in Tyrone. Another victim injured in the incident survived and was rushed to a local hospital.
In all, Sheriff Sigman says there were three crime scenes with two bodies, two scenes with one body each and a crime scene involving Joseph Aldridge's body. All six scenes have been cleared at this time.
Missouri Sate Highway Patrol's Jeff Kinder says this particular investigation has been difficult for law enforcement officers.
"In our job we see a lot of bad stuff and this is bad, this is hard on our police officers who are working here," he says. "It's not natural to see that sort of thing. And I'm sure they were as shocked as a lot of people are in this room."

<http://www.polin.pl/en/news/2016/07/09/pogrom-in-jedwabne-course-of-events> dct:description """What happened in Jedwabne on 10 July unfolded in a series of subsequent events. The first was taking Jews out of their houses and the last – setting fire to a barn soaked with paraffin. According to statements of witnesses, there was “a load of people” on Jedwabne’s market square on 10 July.
Some of the gathered made sure Jews would not leave the square. It is uncertain whether they created a cordon by holding each other’s arms, like it had happened in other localities. Those who committed the crime, its perpetrators in the strict sense of the word, were Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne and its surroundings – ca. 40 men.
Having herded them into the market square, the tormentors forced Jews to destroy the statue of Lenin and shout: “the war is our fault.” Several dozen Jewish men were then forced to carry the remains of the destroyed statue in a march headed by the rabbi carrying a red flag. It was undoubtedly a way of stigmatising the entire Jewish community, of giving them the label of those responsible for communism. Germans were present during all of the events, both members of the SS and military policemen. According to some witnesses, they were issuing orders to the Poles.
Several hours later, Jews were killed in a mass murder. Jewish people were herded into Bronisław Śleszyński’s barn. First, the perpetrators killed a group of 40-50 men, the very same people who had been forced to carry around the remains of the statue of Lenin. Afterwards, ca. 300 more people were herded into the same barn – Jews who had been brought there from the market, including women and children. The walls of the building were soaked in paraffin and then set on fire. It is estimated that several hundred people fell victim to the Jedwabne pogrom.
The mass murder in Jedwabne was not an isolated event in the period. In the summer of 1941, after the Soviets had fled and Germans had entered the territory, the region of Łomża and Białystok saw numerous acts of violence perpetrated by Poles on their Jewish neighbours, with varied participation of the new occupant. The investigation carried out by the Institute of National Remembrance showed that such events had unfolded in 23 localities. Those were: Bielsk Podlaski (the village of Pilki), Choroszcz, Czyżew, Goniądz, Grajewo, Jasionówka, Jedwabne, Kleszczele, Knyszyn, Kolno, Kuźnica, Narewka, Piątnica, Radziłów, Rajgród, Sokoły, Stawiski, Suchowola, Szczuczyn, Trzcianne, Tykocin, Wasilków, Wąsosz, and Wizna.
All these acts had four common features: anti-Semitism existent in a significant part of the Polish population; looting Jewish property as one of the main motives for aggression; seeking retribution for real or imaginary cooperation of Jews with the Soviet occupant; German incitement – varying in different places, from direct organisation of pogroms to giving encouragement or condoning the behaviour.
Some of those pogroms resulted in several or around a dozen people being killed, while others – most importantly those in Jedwabne and Radziłów – caused the death of hundreds of Jews.
The Jedwabne pogrom became a subject of several legal proceedings after the war. Following the investigation carried out in the years 1948-1949, the Regional Court in Łomża indicted 22 inhabitants of Jedwabne. 11 people were given prison sentences of between 8 and 15 years and one accused was given capital punishment, which was later changed into a 15-year prison sentence.
In the years 2000-2002, the Institute of National Remembrance conducted an investigation of the Jedwabne crime. On 10 July 2001, a monument commemorating the victims of the Jedwabne pogrom was unveiled.
The text was written on the basis of the article Wokół Jedwabnego by Prof. Maweł Machcewicz, which appeared in the book Wokół Jedwabnego, vol. 1: Research, ed. P. Machcewicz, K.

On this day in 1974, Nelson Rockefeller, a former 14-year governor of New York and a dynastic scion of one of the nation’s wealthiest families, was sworn in as the 41st vice president of the United States after being confirmed by Congress.
President Gerald Ford had nominated Rockefeller for the post four months earlier. Ford, also a recently appointed vice president, acted on the Rockefeller appointment 11 days after President Richard Nixon had resigned in disgrace on Aug. 9 as a consequence of the Watergate scandal.
Although he had said he was “just not built for standby equipment,” Rockefeller accepted the nomination. “It was entirely a question of there being a constitutional crisis and a crisis of confidence on the part of the American people,” Rockefeller said. “I felt there was a duty incumbent on any American who could do anything that would contribute to a restoration of confidence in the democratic process and in the integrity of government.”
In November 1975, Rockefeller told Ford that he did not want to be his running mate in 1976 since “I didn’t come down [to Washington] to get caught up in party squabbles, which only make it more difficult for the president in a very difficult time.”
Ford, a moderate Republican from Michigan, acceded to pressure from GOP conservatives by elevating Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to the ticket. Ford remains, 36 years later, the last president to not have his vice president as his running mate.
Ford later said not choosing Rockefeller was one of the biggest political mistakes he ever made. With Dole on the ticket, Ford narrowly lost to Jimmy Carter, a former Georgia Democratic governor.

<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/sanders-looking-to-rack-up-west-virginia-win-over-clinton-222952> dct:description """When officials in Logan, West Virginia, were contacted last week about hosting Hillary Clinton for a local rally, it didn’t take long for them to respond with an answer: Hell no.
“Bill and Hillary Clinton are simply not welcome in our town,” they wrote in a letter to the office of Sen. Joe Manchin, whose office had inquired about the availability of local facilities. “Mrs. Clinton’s anti-coal messages are the last thing our suffering town needs at this point. The policies that have been championed by people like Mrs. Clinton have all but devastated our fair town, and honestly, enough is enough. We wish them the best in their campaign, however we again state they are not welcome on our city’s properties.”
While Clinton might have the support of much of West Virginia’s political establishment in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, the Logan letter reveals the depth of some of the opposition to her candidacy. It’s sparked to some degree by a remark that continues to haunt her in coal country, two months after she made it in a March town hall.
Referring to the transition to clean energy, Clinton said: “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”
While Clinton later apologized for the comment, it’s proving to be a painful thorn in her campaign. She was publicly confronted about it at a West Virginia roundtable discussion last week and finds herself trailing Bernie Sanders in the two most recent public polls.
“It’s an uphill battle for Hillary in this state both in the primary and certainly much steeper uphill battle in the general election,” said former West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall, a Clinton supporter, said.
Clinton’s coal comment proved so jarring to West Virginia, where the Obama administration’s energy policies have been referred to as a “war on coal,” that a candidate for the nonpartisan West Virginia Supreme Court used the comment in a recent ad to contrast herself with Washington politicians.
“That clip, that sentence has been running all the time basically in the last two weeks in ads relating to [the] Supreme Court race here and it is a very heavily contested Supreme Court race,” said George Carenbauer, a former West Virginia Democratic Party chairman. “I would say they’ve had a couple of million dollars’ worth of ads in which that clip appears. ... So you’ve had the airwaves just pummeled with that, just constant, and I think that affects what goes on.”
Eight years ago, West Virginia gave Clinton a very different reception. Clinton swept every county in the state against Obama, winning 67 percent to 26 percent.
This time around, she’s got the support of Sen. Joe Manchin and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, the state’s highest-ranking Democrats, and the endorsement of the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the only daily newspaper in the state’s capital and largest city. But that’s where her advantages in the state end.
Clinton tends to run best in the most diverse states, but West Virginia is overwhelmingly white — which works to the Vermont senator’s advantage. And independents can vote in the Democratic primary, another factor which in other states has given Sanders an edge. While Sanders might be a little too liberal for the state’s culturally conservative Democrats, Clinton could suffer from her Obama administration ties — he’s unpopular enough that a felon won 41 percent against him in the 2012 Democratic primary.
On a state that is struggling economically, Sanders has focused on his message of economic inequality and highlighted his anti-poverty proposals during campaign stops.
“When I talk about the need to think big, to think outside of the box and to reject incremental change, I am talking about McDowell County and the thousands of other communities that have been tossed out, left behind, and abandoned by the rich and the powerful,” Sanders said Thursday during an anti-poverty forum in one of the poorest counties in West Virginia, one of his first campaign stops. “In my view, we need to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.”
The Sanders campaign has also focused on college communities, hoping to run up the score in places like Morgantown, home to West Virginia University.
“We're working in the Northern Panhandle, the Eastern Panhandle. We're working in the southern portion of the state. We've been working in Huntington and Charleston,” Sanders state director Helen Strain said. “So we're working pretty much a large swath of the state.”
The larger problem for Clinton, Carenbauer argued, is that the state tends to resist establishment-oriented politicians and Clinton is not only one of the most high-profile politicians in the country, she’s one of the national Democrats most closely aligned with Obama.
“She’s a much bigger target than Bernie Sanders,” Carenbauer said. “You’re not going to find an ad — I don’t know where Bernie Sanders is on environmental issues, but I doubt it’s to the right of Hillary Clinton. ... You’re not going to find [Sanders] in any ads by Republicans because he’s not a big national figure. Hillary Clinton is, she’s well-known.”""" ;

Relief efforts continue across the country as floods, tornadoes devastate communities
WASHINGTON, June 2, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is responding in Massachusetts where tornadoes cut a destructive swath through the western part of the state yesterday. At least 480 people spent Wednesday night in Red Cross shelters in Massachusetts.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090108/RedCrossLOGO)
About 19 communities reported tornado damage with the heaviest damage around Springfield, the third largest city in the state. Red Cross workers responded immediately, assisting area residents as well as the hundreds of emergency responders on the scene. Disaster teams opened shelters throughout the area and are providing food, drinks and emotional support. Damage assessment will begin today. Additional workers are being deployed to the region from Red Cross chapters in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
"This has been an extraordinary response effort that we expect will continue for days to come," said Paige Thayer, deputy director of chapter support for the American Red Cross Pioneer Valley Chapter in Massachusetts. "We have a terrific team of volunteers who will continue to provide relief services to those in need."
The Red Cross response in Massachusetts comes on the heels of a multitude of large disaster relief operations this spring. Overnight, at least four states reported more than 100 people in Red Cross shelters.
Red Cross workers are helping people in the northwestern region of the country, where rising rivers are forcing people from their homes. More than 250 people spent Wednesday night in Red Cross shelters in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.
In North Dakota, as many as 60 Red Cross workers from all around the country have arrived to operate shelters, provide food and offer emotional support to the many people whose lives have been disrupted. Additional staff and supplies are being deployed to the area. "This is the beauty of the American Red Cross," said West Dakota Chapter Executive Director Janel Schmitz. "In these situations, the Red Cross deploys volunteers from across the country to support the response effort. Someday, our volunteers will return the favor to them."
Red Cross teams are distributing food throughout affected neighborhoods in Montana, and assessing damage to homes. Particularly hard hit is the Crow Nation in southeastern Montana where some residents are stranded in their homes. The Red Cross is delivering food and water to the area every day.
In Joplin, MO, Tuscaloosa, AL and Minneapolis, MN, more than 175 people stayed in Red Cross shelters Wednesday night. Devastating tornadoes tore through the states in the past several weeks. As part of these tornado responses, Red Cross workers are delivering meals and snacks as well as comfort and clean-up items, and operating emergency aid stations to provide health and mental health services.
The Red Cross depends on financial donations to get help to people affected by disasters. Please consider making a donation today to help to those in need. Visit www.redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS, or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Contributions may also be sent to your local American Red Cross chapter or to the American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.
About the American Red Cross:
The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies nearly half of the nation's blood; teaches lifesaving skills; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a charitable organization — not a government agency — and depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.

<http://www.rd.com/content/everyday-hero-jeff-may/> dct:description """The ninth-graders in Missy Dodds’s seventh-period study hall were restless that Monday afternoon, March 21, 2005. It was the last period of the day. All eyes were on the big clock on the front wall of the classroom — just minutes until the final bell.
Jeff May sat alone at a table calculating algebra problems. If he cranked through his schoolwork now, he figured, he could meet up with a buddy that afternoon to shoot baskets in his aunt’s driveway.
Photographed by Layne Kennedy When a troubled student started shooting, Jeff May tackled him.
May was nearly a full-blooded Ojibwe, like many of the students and teachers at Red Lake Senior High School in northern Minnesota. The 15-year-old didn’t mind studying, but he much preferred playing basketball.
Suddenly there was frantic pounding on the door. Neva Rogers, one of the teachers, rushed into the classroom, breathless. “Somebody’s shooting out there!” Rogers said.
Just a few minutes earlier, a young man in a black trench coat, his hair spiked into thorns, had walked into the building carrying three guns. One of the security guards stationed at the main entrance, Derrick Brun, confronted him. Even though the guard was unarmed, the gunman shot him twice, killing him.
Then he fired another shot down the hallway, narrowly missing Rogers, a 62-year-old English teacher. Dodds quickly locked the door and snapped off the lights. “Get in back!” she told the students. “Hide!”
May flipped a table up on its side, spilling his math book and papers to the floor as he knelt behind the makeshift bunker. Nearby crouched his best friend, Dewayne Lewis, and another classmate, Alicia White. For months, May had had a crush on White, but he hadn’t mustered the courage to ask her out.
The classroom was absolutely silent. Suddenly there were shots in the hallway outside — loud booms that sounded like textbooks slammed to the floor. As seconds ticked by, the shots boomed louder, closer.
An instant later, the window beside the locked door was shattered by a shotgun blast. A burly figure in a trench coat and combat boots climbed through the two-foot- wide opening. May recognized Jeff Weise. Although the two boys both lived on the reservation, they had never spoken.
Other students sometimes picked on the troubled boy. For the past few months, Weise had been tutored at home. He was depressed and being treated for suicidal tendencies. Doctors had prescribed Prozac to try to get him into a better balance. But today Weise carried a 12-gauge
shotgun, a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol. On his face was a frightening smile.
“God save us,” said Mrs. Rogers.
Weise looked over at her. He leveled his .40-caliber and fired. The bullet struck her in the head, and she slumped to the floor, dead. He then turned to the students huddled in the back of the room. “Do you guys believe in God?” he asked.
“No,” answered one boy, Chon Gai’ la Morris. May said nothing.
Weise pointed his gun and opened fire. Boom. May watched his best friend Dewayne slump. Boom. Alicia White, May’s crush, crumpled. Boom. Boom. Boom. Chanelle Rosebear, Chase Lussier and Thurlene Stillday lay fatally wounded.
The killer aimed his gun at Dodds and squeezed the trigger. Click. It was empty. He reached to reload.
As soon as Weise started shooting, Jeff May thought, Somebody’s got
to stop this guy. At six-foot-three and 300 pounds, he realized he was one of the few kids who might
have a chance against the gunman, who stood six feet tall and weighed about 250.
May was a varsity football player, but he was no tough guy. Still, he thought, if I can slow him down, maybe I can save some lives. At least he might buy a little time until police arrived. May figured his best chance was to surprise Weise, take him down. Glancing around for a weapon, he saw nothing. Then he realized he was still clutching the pencil he’d used to calculate his
algebra problems.
In one motion, May lunged at the shooter and jabbed the pencil hard into his side. But something deflected the blow. It turned out Weise was wearing a bulletproof vest swiped from his police officer grandfather, Daryl Lussier.
Earlier that afternoon, Weise had stopped at Lussier’s house, where he shot and killed his grandfather and his grandfather’s girlfriend, Michelle Sigana. Then Weise had grabbed
the keys to Lussier’s patrol car and drove to the school.
No one knows what set Weise off that day. But he was clearly determined to kill as many people as he could.
May tried to wrestle him to the ground, but Weise stubbornly held his own. Then he managed to raise his reloaded pistol and fire right at May’s face.
May saw a bright flash of light and collapsed hard on the floor. The bullet had entered his right cheek, fractured his jaw and lodged in his neck, near his vertebrae. Blood splattered Weise’s black boots.
The two had grappled for just enough time, witnesses estimate, to spare the lives of the remaining dozen people in the classroom. In total, Weise spent less than ten minutes at the high school, but left eight people dead and another seven wounded in the deadliest school shooting since Columbine.
Four Red Lake police officers arrived and exchanged gunfire with Weise in the hallway outside Mrs. Dodds’s classroom. One officer shot him three times. The troubled boy staggered back into the classroom and fatally shot himself in the head.
Speaking for herself and the other survivors, Dodds says Jeff May saved their lives when he jumped at the killer. His brave action did not surprise her. “I totally would expect that of him,” she says.
May was airlifted to MeritCare Hospital, 105 miles away in Fargo, North Dakota. He suffered a stroke that immobilized his left side and required surgery to remove the
bullet. For many tense hours, his family members feared they would lose him. He is recovering, slowly, with two daily hourlong sessions each of physical, occupational and speech therapy.
Still, lying in his hospital bed two months after the shooting, May says if he had to relive that day, he would once again abandon the shelter of the overturned table and try to stop the shooter. Why?
“To make sure so many people don’t die,” he says.""" ;

<http://www.rferl.org/content/protesters-russian-embassy-yerevan-guymri-killing/26795585.html> dct:description """GYUMRI, Armenia -- Large crowds mourned at a funeral ceremony for six members of an Armenian family investigators say were massacred by a Russian soldier, and protesters scuffled with police who prevented them from burning a Russian flag outside Moscow's embassy in Yerevan.
Tensions were high as parliament chairman Galust Sahakian and other lawmakers and public figures joined hundreds of people thronging the ceremony on January 15 at a church in the city of Gyumri, the site of Russia's military base.
The victims of the January 12 attack -- a local couple, their son and daughter-in-law, a 2-year-old granddaughter, and an unmarried daughter -- were buried after the ceremony. The couple's six-month-old grandson was stabbed but survived.
In the capital, Yerevan, police prevented dozens of angry protresters from buring a Russian flag outside the Russian Embassy and scuffled with the demonstrators. Two protesters -- one of them a prominent film director, Tigran Khzmalian -- were detained.
Authorities say Private Valery Permyakov has confessed to killing the six victims after he deserted the Russian base, Moscow's biggest foothold in the strategic South Caucasus. He was detained by Russian border guards near the Armenian-Turkish border on January 13.
The Armenian prosecutor-general's office has indicated that Russia will prosecute Permyakov. On January 14, protesters in Yerevan and Gyumri demanded the prosecutor-general come up with a solution by January 15 that would ensure he is tried in Armenia.""" ;

Posted at 01:43 on 20 February, 2008 UTC
The French minister in charge of overseas territories, Christian Estrosi, has commented on the collapse of talks among French Polynesia’s pro-autonomy politicians who failed to agree on a power sharing accord for the new assembly’s five-year term.
This follows just over a week after the early election which was called by France in a bid to increase political stability despite overwhelming opposition by the former territorial assembly.
In the election, the To Tatou Aia coalition fell short of winning an absolute majority and failed in talks with the Tahoeraa Huiraatira to lock in a majority despite a French appeal for reconciliation.
Earlier, appeals by the To Tatou Aia for assembly members to defect and to join its team had been ignored.
Mr Estrosi says pro-French Polynesians would feel betrayed if his government couldn’t bring the means of the state to the development of French Polynesia.
He went on to say that he had a lot of respect for the Tahoeraa leader, Gaston Flosse, who was always attached to the values of the UMP Party and, as he put it, Polynesia’s autonomy within France.
The assembly is due to meet in two days to elect an assembly president and two days later it is to choose a new president.""" ;

Posted at 22:53 on 21 February, 2008 UTC
French Polynesia’s newly elected assembly is scheduled to have its first meeting today to elect an assembly president.
It is also to confirm that the election of a president for a five-year term will be held this weekend.
This follows an early general election which has seen the To Tatou Aia coalition led by Gaston Tong Sang emerge as the biggest bloc with 27 out of the assembly’s 57 seats.
The remaining 30 seats were won by the pro-independence Union For Democracy and the Tahoeraa Huiraatira.
Attempts to forge a pro-autonomy alliance with the Tahoeraa have so far failed despite appeals for reconciliation by the French government which ordered the election in a bid to increase political stability.
And Mr Tong Sang’s calls for individual assembly members of other parties to join his team have been ignored.
If no candidate for the assembly presidency wins an absolute majority in the first two rounds of voting, a relative majority in the third round will suffice to win.
In case the two remaining candidates get the same number of votes, the oldest one will be declared elected.""" ;

Posted at 23:21 on 12 February, 2009 UTC
French Polynesia’s assembly has elected Oscar Temaru as the next president following last weekend’s resignation of Gaston Tong Sang.
In the second round of voting, Mr Temaru won 37 votes, 17 more than Mr Tong Sang.
He was elected with the support of the Tahoeraa Huiraatira, whose candidate, Edouard Fritch had withdrawn from the race after this morning’s first round of voting.

<http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/columbus_day_storm_1962.htm> dct:description """Any Salem resident who lived through the Columbus Day Storm will never for-get it. Although it is generally believed to have been a hurricane, the Columbus Day Storm was actually an "extra tropical cyclone," a weather pattern formed when a cool air mass meets up with a warm one. In addition, the Columbus Day Storm traveled very fast: nearly 1,800 miles in less than one-and-a-half days, much faster than a hurricane. At its peak, between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. that Friday, it brought gusts of 90 m.p.h. and sustained winds of over 70 m.p.h., and the total damages to Salem, at $4 million, were higher than for any disaster the City had yet seen. One in every three homes in Salem was damaged by the Columbus Day Storm. The storm came with little warning and hit hard. It crossed the Oregon-Califor-nia border on Friday, October 12, at noon, moving north at 48 m.p.h., reaching Salem at mid-afternoon. The ferocity of the winds as they roared through Sa-lem shocked residents. In downtown, stunned pedestrians screamed as they were hit by glass from shattering windows, and dodged flying debris of all kinds. Shoppers trying desperately to get home were knocked to the ground by the wind. A brick wall fell on three City employees standing on the sidewalk. Cars were blown onto sidewalks and yards. The large sign on the roof of the Elsinore Theater was battered and crumpled by the wind. The Marion Motor Hotel lost part of a wall on the Commercial Street side, and part of a wall at the Capitol Press Building fell onto two cars; rain then poured into the building. The steeple was torn from the Christ Lutheran Church at 18th and State Streets and dropped onto the sidewalk. St. Paul's Episcopal Church on Liberty Street also lost its steeple, its point spearing the ground like a javelin. Trees were blown over and uprooted. At McNary Field, hangars were damaged, as were twelve planes, some of which were overturned. Witnesses said winds were so strong that pieces of the concrete foundation of one hangar were actually lifted from the ground. Parks in the City were all hard hit, in particular Willson Park, which lost so many trees that it would take a State crew one month, working every day, to clean it up. A spruce toppled the three-and-a-quarter-ton "Circuit Rider" statue, splitting it at the seams. Court Street was completely blocked by fallen trees, which had damaged a dozen cars on the street. Two teenagers were killed when the car they were driving was hit by a tree. On the River, small boats were torn from their moorings. Power was knocked out all over the State, Salem being no exception. Thou-sands lost their electricity, and a Greyhound bus driver was quoted as saying he had seen no lights in the Willamette Valley on a trip between Eugene and Port-land. Some City residents went more than a week without electricity and, in rural areas, up to three weeks. Local repair crews were augmented by crews from Spokane, Washington, and stores reported runs on candles, campstoves, and white gas. Seven thousand Salem residents lost their phone service, and Northwest Natural Gas reported some broken gas lines. Radio and television towers were knocked over. Lack of water became a problem in hilly areas of the city - including Fairmount Hill, Candalaria, and West Salem, when loss of electricity shut down the pumps. In the farming areas surrounding Salem, agricultural damage was heavy. Walnut and filbert crops were damaged when the nuts were blown down early and trees were uprooted and split. Crops of cauliflower, broccoli, sweet and field corn sustained heavy damages. A street crew of 25 men began clean up operations Friday night while the storm still raged, concentrating on creating a single lane through tree-blocked streets. The National Guard was called out to prevent looting of businesses with blown-out windows and holes in their buildings, and the Red Cross began assisting people in need of food and shelter. Governor Mark Hatfield declared the entire State an emergency disaster area, requesting $2.7 million in Federal aid. On Saturday, October 13, he declared, "Oregon is on the way back. People are exhibiting their pioneer spirit in remarkable fashion." Somewhat ironically, the day after the storm was beautiful and warm, a perfect day on which to begin the giant task of cleaning up after such a storm.

Read the story
One does not have to be a Richard Nixon fan to see that, even granting the facts as Posner states them, there is, in truth, a very significant difference between what Nixon did in 1960 and what Al Gore is doing now. That difference -- Nixon's timely concession and Gore's refusal to concede -- is the single stark fact that has turned this year's election into the circus that it now is.
Advertisement:
Few people would begrudge any candidate the right to insist on as fair and accurate a voting process as is humanly possible. But if Gore were to follow Nixon's example, he would -- on the basis of the best evidence at the time of the election -- officially concede the contest as Nixon did. He would allow preparations for an orderly transition process to begin, while at the same time pursuing within a reasonable time frame whatever legitimate further investigation might be relevant to affirm or deny the apparent election results.
I suspect that most Americans, regardless of political persuasion, would be fair-minded enough to accept the reversal of initial election results if the evidence ultimately indicated there was no other honest choice. But when it appears a candidate is simply unwilling to accept gracefully a close defeat, those who cast their votes can hardly be faulted for supposing that that person is more concerned with his own welfare than the welfare of his country.
-- Glenn R. Kennedy

Amen to Gerald Posner! Incredibly, self-serving, partisan conservatives, in pointing to a "selfless," "saintly" Nixon of 1960, seem to completely forget the more lasting image Nixon left us with 14 years later when he resigned his office in abject disgrace. One need only look to that regrettable period of our history to see that Nixon cared little about the Constitution, fair play or the rule of law in our country. Somehow, nonetheless, ol' Tricky Dick seems to have managed to get the last laugh in the perpetuation of this "angelic 1960 Nixon" myth. Thank you, Mr. Posner, for exposing the myth for what it is!

BRENDA LIN, 15, returned to Sydney yesterday to be confronted by an unimaginable horror.
She flew in from New Caledonia to news that her father, Min Lin, mother, Lillie, two brothers Terry, 9, and Henry, 12, and a woman, 39, thought to be her aunt were all bashed to death with blunt weapons in separate bedrooms in a case a seasoned detective described as "absolutely horrific".
The family of five were beaten to death in the upstairs bedrooms of their Epping home, police said, victims of what they called a "targeted" attack early on Saturday.
Police were searching the neighbourhood yesterday, visiting Mr Lin's Rawson Street newsagency last night to look for evidence. At midday they had seized and towed away a red Toyota Corolla from nearby Beck Street, just outside the house of relatives of the Lins.

Cards and flowers lay at the doorstep of the newsagency. One card read: "You did a good job delivering our newspapers rain and shine. Rest in peace."
Many residents arrived at the newsagency because their papers had not been delivered, only to discover the news of the murders printed in the stacks of undistributed papers.
"It's a horrific crime, absolutely horrific," said Detective Superintendent Geoff Beresford.
"It is extraordinary, it's extremely violent and certainly unusual to have this many people murdered on one occasion."
The family's bodies were found just after 9am by a female family member in three upstairs bedrooms of their Boundary Street home, lying where they were killed at some time between midnight and 9am on Saturday.
"It certainly appears that all the injuries were blunt force trauma to the upper bodies and to the heads of the victims," Superintendent Beresford said. Police were appealing for witnesses who may have seen the killers arrive or leave the house, which will remain a sealed-off crime scene today.
They said the killings were unlikely to be a robbery gone wrong, because nothing in the house appeared to have been stolen. Extortion was being examined as a possible motive for the killers, but police said last night that, as yet, there was "no suggestion" of it.
Superintendent Beresford said a number of family members had been interviewed, and were an "enormous help".
He said no link had been established between the killings and the fact Mr Lin had witnessed an armed robbery across the road from his newsagency in May.
Mr Lin and his wife had previously owned a supermarket in Merrylands but had sold it in November 2002 and bought Epping Central Newsagency.
The woman who sold them the newsagency, who asked not to be named, said she had seen the couple almost every day since.
"They had just given me, on Wednesday, a card for my eldest son, who'd just had a baby. They were so nice. I still can't get it out of my head.\"""" ;

The State Emergency Service this afternoon issued an evacuation order for residents of central Maitland, South Maitland and Lorne following revised predictions that floodwaters would peak at five centimetres above the levee by 9pm (AEST).
Residents were being advised to be out of their homes by 8pm, SES spokesman Philip Campbell said.
"The revised flood peak of 11.4 metres is expected by 9pm and that will cause the levee to over-top,'' Mr Campbell said.
About 5000 people in the Maitland and Singleton areas have been told to evacuate since yesterday.
Police were working with the SES to evacuate the threatened areas.
Lower Hunter Police Local Area Commander, Superintendent Desmond Organ assured residents security would be provided to vacant properties.
"Police are urging the public to co-operate with all requests by SES and emergency services personnel and to take care on the roads and drive safely,'' Superintendent Organ said.
Evacuation centres at East Maitland and Maitland High School are open to residents and will provide welfare assistance, first-aid, food and transport, he said.
Those affected can call 1800 227 228 for more information.
Water, sewerage failures spark evacuations
Local councils on the Central Coast are keeping hundreds of regular staff on duty tonight as council facilities and up to 50,000 homes remain without power.
Outages in the Gosford and Wyong council areas have disrupted more than 40 pumping stations in low-lying areas, causing sewage to overflow into stormwater drains.
The loss of electricity has cut drinking water supply to some homes.
The severe storms that lashed the areas have eased, but relief could be a long way off.
"EnergyAustralia is talking about days and days [until power is restored]," Wyong Shire Council general manager Kerry Yates said.
Wyong Council is supplying water to areas outside its local area in Gosford city and areas serviced by Hunter Water until power is restored.
Drinking water supplies have also been disrupted by falling trees and power poles, which have uprooted water mains.
Council staff are likely to repair small breaks within hours, Wyong's services director David Cathers said.
Up to 150 regular council staff have joined skeleton weekend crews to address the problems.
"The council has mobilised and we'll be continuing through the night - it's a 24-hour operation,'' Mr Cathers said.
About 400 residents were yesterday asked to leave the Chittaway and Tacoma areas that border Tuggerah Lakes, but many elected to stay, State Emergency Service spokesman Phil Campbell said.
Some of them are now asking to be evacuated since they remain without water and electricity.
The Wyong River and creeks that feed Tuggerah Lakes have caused localised flash flooding, which is waist-high in some areas, Mr Campbell said.
Water levels were dropping but at a very slow rate, he said.""" ;

Yesterday afternoon police recovered the body of the woman, who died when the car she was in was swept away in racing floodwaters west of Brisbane. The death, which followed that of a 20-year-old man on Sunday night, came as emergency crews dealt with fresh flood damage across Brisbane, Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley with up to 250 millimetres of rain falling between Wednesday night and yesterday morning.
About 10,000 insurance claims worth $95 million have been lodged so far but insurers say the total bill, including infrastructure, is nudging $500 million.
Queensland's Premier, Anna Bligh, yesterday activated the state's natural disaster plan, allowing greater co-ordination and giving assistance to more families than the previous declaration on Sunday. Ms Bligh confirmed that an elderly woman died after being trapped in a car that was swept off a crossing yesterday morning. The woman's elderly husband was recovering in hospital.
"You are reminded of the awesome power of nature," Ms Bligh said as she toured damage around Ipswich.
Emergency services received more than 1200 calls for assistance, with Ipswich, Bundamba and the Lockyer Valley the worst-affected areas. The Bureau of Meteorology said further wet weather, lightning and possible hail were expected last night across the south-east.
Queensland's Fire and Rescue Service conducted 31 swift water rescues, mainly of motorists trapped on flooded roads.
Among them was a pregnant woman who was taken to Gold Coast Hospital after she went into labour. Her baby - Ned Shelton, weighing 3.25 kilograms - was born by caesarean section at 6am.
The Rugby League World Cup final between Australia and New Zealand will still go ahead on Saturday night.
■ Twenty-six women were injured, one critically, when a balcony collapsed under the weight of 70 people at an end-of-school party.

As the stricken Pasha Bulker lay poised to flood Newcastle's beaches with 700 tonnes of shipping oil last night, an investigation was being planned into why it and other vessels did not heed warnings to get away from the shore before yesterday's storms struck.
Union groups said ships flying flags of convenience, such as the Panama-registered Pasha Bulker, were less safe than national shipping lines, and said the potential disaster had been an accident waiting to happen. The claims were angrily rejected by the ship owner's association.
The NSW Ports Minister, Joe Tripodi, rushed to Newcastle, saying the situation was "clearly unacceptable", but refusing to be drawn on its causes.
Mr Tripodi, anticipating criticism over delays at the clogged coal-loading port, promised that NSW Maritime would investigate.
The Newcastle Ports Corporation radioed 56 cargo vessels queuing to load coal at 5am yesterday and warned them to move out to sea. Other warnings were issued on Thursday night. All but 11 vessels heeded the call.
There was speculation the ships' captains might have taken a calculated risk that they could ride out the storm.
A spokeswoman for the corporation described the weather as extraordinary. "There is a 17.95 metre swell. We knew the weather that was coming, and they were warned, but there have been issues with [the ships leaving]."
Twenty-one crew members, two suffering mild hypothermia and one with a minor arm injury, were winched from the Pasha Bulker's deck yesterday afternoon.
Witnesses said last night that creases were visible in the ship's hull, caused by the pounding surf.
NSW Maritime could not confirm reports of oil washing up, saying it might be bilge water.
The NSW Nature Conservation Council said that if the vessel split apart, the result would be an ecological disaster because the ship is marooned directly in front of heritage-listed sand dunes and an iconic beach. Hazardous material teams, the State Emergency Service and maritime engineers were on site last night monitoring the ship. The Pasha Bulker has 700 tonnes of fuel oil, 38 tonnes of diesel and 40 tonnes of lube oil.
As yet there was no consensus on how to free the ship or prevent it from splitting apart and drenching the coast in oil.
A team from United Salvage, a marine salvage company, arrived at the site yesterday with a contract from the owners to try and save the ship.""" ;

NSW Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Fullerton on Tuesday upheld the bail application by Sydney businessman Robert Xie, who is accused of murdering his brother-in-law Min "Norman" Lin and four members of Mr Lin's family in July 2009.
"For an accused person to remain in custody for five years or more is impossible to view as fair and commensurate with a fair and just criminal process," Justice Fullerton said.
"I propose that conditional bail be granted."

Mr Xie, 51, is expected to be released from custody within the next 24 hours, but will be bound by 17 strict conditions including that he must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, report to police three times a day and effectively remain under house arrest.
He has also been ordered to put his Epping home - worth more than $1 million - up as a bail surety, and a $100,000 cash deposit which has been provided by his sister.

Mr Xie's wife Kathy Lin nodded and cried as the decision was handed down, grasping the hand of the Salvation Army officer sitting next to her. The accused showed little emotion.
"Thank you to my legal team and thank you to those who believed in me and my husband," Mrs Lin said as she left the court.

The bail decision follows the end of Mr Xie's nine-month trial last week, which concluded with the 12-member jury being unable to reach a verdict. He is now awaiting a retrial which could take place as late as June next year.
In handing down her decision on Tuesday, Justice Fullerton pointed to reports from medical experts showing that Mr Xie had suffered significant psychological and mental impacts from being in jail, which could effect his ability to participate fully in his next trial.

The 51-year-old has been in protective custody, effectively spending 24 hours a day in isolation.
"Of critical significance is (psychologist) Mr Borenstein's revised diagnosis of a 'major depressive disorder requiring ongoing psychiatric assistance outside the prison environment'," Justice Fullerton said.
This, along with the severe anxiety Mr Xie was suffering, was a crucial factor in Justice Fullerton's determination that Mr Xie had "shown cause" as to why he should be released from jail as required under the state's bail laws.
"It is a principal of Common Law that if an accused is detained in custody pending trial that detention should not be so lengthy as to amount to a punishment," she said.
Justice Fullerton did not accept the argument of the Crown that Mr Xie represented an "unacceptable risk" of attempting to flee the jurisdiction if released, and of attempting to influence or threaten witnesses in the case.
The Crown had argued that Mr Xie had access to considerable funds in China, pointing to money transfers of more than $4 million that had been made to his account or related accounts since 2011.
It also claimed that, because Mr Xie was facing a life sentence if convicted, he had a very powerful motivation to flee and could live in China without detection of extradition.
The defence strenuously rejected this argument, asserting that Mr Xie's wife and other family members were in Australia, providing him with "strong community ties".
Justice Fullerton found that conditions could be imposed which would mitigate any risks.
The decision is the latest development in a long-running saga that began when the bodies of Min Lin, his wife Lily, their two young sons Henry and Terry, and the boy's aunt Irene, were found, beaten and bludgeoned to death in their bedrooms.
Police allege that Mr Xie crept into the Lins' home in the quiet northern Sydney suburb of North Epping and murdered the family with a hammer-like object.
But Mr Xie has pleaded not guilty to the crime, a position he has maintained since his arrest in May 2011.
Since that time the 51-year-old has faced trial three times, the first two of which were prematurely aborted.
He will return to court on February 19.""" ;

Ms Lin told court that Xie sexually assaulted her regularly until he was arrested and charged with the murders in May 2011.

Prosecutors argued Xie's sexual interest in Ms Lin was one of the motives for the murders because he could have complete access to her with his in-laws dead.
The trials heard Ms Lin's bedroom was left undisturbed on the night of the murders.

The evidence that the killer seemingly knew Ms Lin was away, and knew the layout of the Lins' house, helped police focus on Xie as a suspect.
Xie also offered to adopt Ms Lin in the hours after the murders, the court heard.
Xie has not been charged over the alleged assaults.
The juries in Xie's four trials knew of Ms Lin's evidence, but journalists could not publish anything that identified her due to laws protecting children involved in crimes.
Justice Elizabeth Fullerton said she accepted the evidence of Ms Lin, referred to as Ms AB, when sentencing Xie to five life sentences earlier this week.
"The risk that this offender may commit offences of violence in the future, and the community's legitimate expectation that it is protected from that risk, is amplified by the sexual violence the offender inflicted on Ms AB after the murders, as the surviving member of her family."
After two aborted trials, and a third trial that ended in a hung jury, a fourth jury found Xie guilty last month.
Xie and Kathy Lin maintain he is innocent.
In the victim impact statement Ms Lin read to the court, she told how the loss of her family had impacted every part of her life.
"It has been 7½ years since I have lost my family. That's 7½ years without a loving mother, 7½ years without a loving father, 7½ years without two exuberant brothers who were my best and closest friends and 7½ years without an extremely kind aunt.
"In this time I have finished my HSC, was accepted into uni, got my first part-time job and learnt to drive. But I have achieved all these things without my family beside me.
"These inherently happy moments are now at most bittersweet, they have now become a painful reminder of the family I have lost and I will never see again.\"""" ;

Right there, on his desk, is the very thing that may link him to the Lin family murders.
It is May 2010, nearly a year since the battered bodies of his brother-in-law's family were found, and the police are closing in.
Xie knows detectives have found bloody shoe prints in the Lin family's North Epping house, and they may match a style of Asics sneaker he wears.
So he collects his shoe boxes, cuts them up, soaks them in a bucket, and flushes the cardboard down the toilet.
Unbeknownst to Xie, police were watching, having set up a pinhole camera in his house to track his every move.

The eerie surveillance video – along with other crucial evidence that helped convict Xie – was publicly released by the NSW Supreme Court on Monday, after a jury found the 53-year-old guilty of five counts of murder.
In Xie's recorded police interviews, he describes watching cycling, cricket and movies at his home on the night of the murders, before going with wife Kathy to her brother's house on the morning of July 18, 2009.

There they found the bodies of Min Lin, his wife Lily, her sister Irene, and the Lins' young sons Henry and Terry lying in pools of blood in their bedrooms.
"I look at the direction of the bed, I can see everywhere was red, red, everywhere is, I think I saw my sister-in-law first," Xie told police days after the murders.

"Once I saw her, I held Kathy and say 'Kathy, don't look at it', but I believe Kathy had already seen it."
The court heard Xie told his wife not to look at Lily's body at a time when he wasn't in a position to see it, and that Min's body was hidden under the covers in the same bed.
The triple-0 calls Kathy Lin made after finding her family's bodies have also been released.
Flustered and crying, Ms Lin tells the emergency operator: "I'm not sure, but maybe someone killed, killed my brother's family now."
She is also captured telling her husband in Cantonese: "I am more scared than you are."
In March 2010, Xie made a call to Detective Sergeant Joseph Maree​ trying to clarify how many bodies he saw in the Lin's house that morning.
But the call only strengthened detectives' suspicions about Xie.
According to a transcript of the call, Xie told Detective Sergeant Maree​ he may have told a police officer at the scene there were five bodies in the house, but in fact he meant "four or five".
At trial, the Crown argued this conversation helped prove Xie was the killer because he was in a position to know there were five victims from the outset, despite Min Lin's body lying undiscovered for some time.""" ;

Three distinct upper level disturbances affected New Mexico from the 7th through the 12th of December. These systems brought a variety of precipitation, with mostly snow in the higher mountain locations and mostly rain across the valleys and plains. Two back door cold fronts also played a role in the weather, one arriving in the northeast on the 8th, and the other on the 11th. The 6 day period recorded substantial snow in the northern mountains while decent rainfall totals were reported over the lowlands. Dense fog often shrouded portions of the eastern plains. The satellite images and adjacent radar images below display the positions of the three storms that affected New Mexico between the 7th and 12th, and a sample of the resulting precipitation they produced. The first storm primarily affected the northwest third of the state, dropping several inches of snow on the northern mountains. The second storm delivered more widespread precipitation, including decent rainfall over the Albuquerque area and much of eastern and southeast New Mexico. The third storm affected mostly the southern half of the state, with lighter precipitation and less coverage. A loop of the infrared satellite images is available here that shows the progression of the storms from the 7th through the morning of the 12th.
Temperatures initally were fairly mild ahead of the first storm on the 7th, with snow confined above 7500 feet. However, a rather strong cold front moved into the northeast plains early on the 8th and continued south and west during the day and into the night. This dropped temperatures considerably by the 9th and 10th, especially over the east, and allowed for snow levels to lower. Temperatures were a little higher over much of the state on the 11th as another cold front arrived in the northeast during the day. This front was weaker and had little impact on the weather, other than to produce a brief burst or two of snow over the eastern plains. The surface temperature loop below shows the trend in temperatures from the 8th through 11th. The tables below list the 6 day total snowfall and precipitation (rainfall and/or liquid equivalent of snow) from these three disturbances.

<http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/events/2008/Mar78snow/index.php> dct:description """March 7-8th Southern Snow Event A strong upper level trough dropped south out of the plains and helped to evolve a surface low pressure system across the northern Gulf of Mexico which then intensified as it lifted into the SE United States. This upper trough slowed and intensified across the Lower MS River Valley Friday afternoon, and brought a large swath of snow to some of the region. The heaviest snow fell mainly to the NW and N of the NWS Jackson forecast area, but a nice section of the NW received anywhere from 2 to 6 inches of snow. The heaviest occurred across extreme northern Chicot County where Dermott measured around 5 inches and then across Bolivar County where 3-6 inches occurred. Below are a few images of the snow accumulation. View the latest Public Information Statement for summary of snowfall totals.

ASTRONOMICALLY SPEAKING AUTUMN BEGAN AT 11:44 AM TODAY...BUT ACROSS WEST CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA THE TEMPERATURES ARE ANYTHING BUT FALL-LIKE. WE`VE HAVE HAD A RESPITE FROM SOME OF THE HIGHER HUMIDITY OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH DEW POINTS EACH AFTERNOON FALLING INTO THE MID 60S...BUT HIGH TEMPERATURES HAVE CONTINUED IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. DURING MOST YEARS WE DO NOT SEE THE FIRST SHOT OF COOLER DRIER AIR UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER...ALBEIT USUALLY IS RATHER SHORT LIVED LASTING ONLY A DAY OR TWO...WITH THE REAL COOL DOWN NOT OCCURRING UNTIL NOVEMBER. A GOOD WAY TO EXAMINE THE TIMING OF THE FIRST COOL DOWN IS BY LOOKING AT OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES. THE OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON A FEW FACTORS...NOT THE LEAST BEING THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVERAGE...HOW STRONG THE WINDS ARE AND THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE AIR NEAR THE GROUND MEASURED BY LOOKING AT THE DEW POINT. IN GENERAL OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES CANNOT FALL BELOW THE DEW POINT...THEREFORE IF THE DEW POINTS ARE STILL IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AS THEY ARE NOW...THEN THE OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES WILL MOST LIKELY ALSO BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S UNLESS A COOL FRONT MOVES THROUGH DURING THE NIGHT.

<http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tsa/weather-events/IceStormDec10/Index.htm> dct:description "Freezing rain moved into Northeast Oklahoma late Saturday night and early Sunday morning and lasted through Monday. Surface high pressure centered over the Northern Plains drove sub-freezing temperatures southward into Oklahoma, as a strong upper level system dug into the southwester U.S. This allowed warm and moist air to override the shallow sub-freezing air near the surface and produced an environment that allowed continued developement of freezing rain in the area for over 36 hours. Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rains and widespread amounts from 1 to 2 inches of rainfall were common. Much of this rain fell in temperatures below 32 degrees and froze in trees, powerlines and exposed surfaces. Ground temperatures were in the lower 40s during most of the event and kept surface roads from becoming too icy. Bridges and overpasses did freeze up and caused some travel problems mainly Sunday night and Monday. The largest impact was power outage with over 200,000 homes without power for several days during and after the event. Severe tree damage will also take days to clean up and years to recover from. Temperatures rose above freezing late Monday, but the damage was done with possibly the costliest Ice Storm in Oklahoma history. The event was forecast well in advance by forecasters at WFO Tulsa." ;

Criteria 1
The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
Criterion 2
There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
Criterion 3
The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants.
Doubt Terrorism Proper
The existence of a "Yes" for "Doubt Terrorism Proper?" records reservation, in the eyes of GTD analysts, that the incident in question is truly terrorism. Such uncertainty, however, was not deemed to be sufficient to disqualify the incident from inclusion into the GTD. Furthermore, such a determination of doubt is subsequently coded by GTD analysts as conforming to one of four possible alternative designations: 1) Insurgency/Guerilla Action; 2) Internecine Conflict Action; 3) Mass Murder; or 4) Purely Criminal Act.""" ;

It will make Singapore the only country in South-east Asia to host a full-fledged edition of the festival in the region.
The outdoor festival will feature three stages and 40 artists which will be announced later, and it will be held at a location that the organisers Ultra Singapore describe as an "iconic venue".
Early-bird tickets go on sale from Tuesday (Jan 19) at 11am at www.ultrasingapore.com . Two-day general admission tickets cost US$135 (S$194) each and premium admission tickets - which include express entry lanes and premium access to dedicated restrooms and food and beverage stalls - are US$160 each.
The Ultra brand was founded in 1997 by executive producer, president and chief executive Russell Faibisch. Last year's Ultra Miami reportedly saw over 165,000 people in attendance.
Mr Alexander Chew, 30, executive producer and partner of Ultra Singapore says: "We are excited for the full festival to be coming to Singapore. We want to provide the fans in the region the proper Ultra experience after the success of last year's Road To Ultra."
Last year, Singapore was one of the venues for Road To Ultra, a smaller, one-day event that is part of a series of international dance music parties launched by the producers of the famed dance music festival brands Ultra and Ultra Worldwide.
The event here saw superstar DJs such as Skrillex, Alesso and Nicky Romero play to an 11,000-strong party crowd at the indoor venue of the Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre on Sept 19. According to organisers,early bird tickets for the event sold out in 21 minutes from the time they were released.
For the main event this year, Ultra Singapore is hoping to draw 20,000 partygoers each day.
Mr Chew says: "Ultra has always worked with the best artists and our goal is to bring a world-class line-up of DJs and live acts to a crowd of over 20,000 a day here in Singapore."
This year, Ultra Festivals will be held in 10 other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Croatia and South Africa.
Ultra Singapore is clearly going to be a rival to the 15-year-old ZoukOut, a mega outdoor electronic dance music festival launched by local nightlife brand Zouk. Both events target partygoers in the region instead of just Singapore.
ZoukOut, which is held annually towards the end of the year at Siloso Beach in Sentosa, has consistently drawn big crowds. Last year's event drew more than 45,000 people over two days. Big name DJs such as Armin Van Buuren and Tiesto headlined the 2015 edition, with two-day festival passes going at $258 each.
Mr Chew does not think Ultra Singapore or ZoukOut will suffer because of the competition.
He says: "In December last year, 70,000 went to Djakarta Warehouse Project, while more than 40,000 went to ZoukOut on the same weekend. We're four months apart (from those events), so I think there's enough market share to go around."

Henry Voong, the father of Binghamton immigration center shooter Jiverly Wong, speaks with The Post-Standard's Ngoc Huynh.
The parents of Jiverly Wong want everyone to know that their son acted of his own free will when he walked into the American Civic Association in Binghamton, NY, earlier this month and started shooting. They also want everyone to know they're sorry for everybody's loss, and for their own.
"Forgive us for having such a son," Henry Voong, Wong's father, told The Post-Standard's Ngoc Huynh. Voong and his wife, Mui Thong, visited Syracuse last week.
Voong and Mui had been declining interview requests since the shooting, but Huynh sent them a note in Vietnamese asking them to speak. They agreed, and on Thursday called to say they had a message to send the world.

At a press conference at 5:15 p.m. Friday, Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft said shooter John Russell Houser exited the Grand Theatre through a side door after shooting several people.
When he saw a police unit pull into the parking lot, Houser re-entered the theater and fired three more rounds, then a fourth, that took his own life, Craft said.
Fifteen shell casings were recovered in various parts of the theater, he said.
"That was an horrific scene," Col. Mike Edmonson, Louisiana State Police, said.
Houser purchased a 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun at a Phenix City, Alabama, pawn shop in February 2014, Craft said.
It's still unclear why Houser was in Lafayette. Craft said he entered Louisiana around July 2 or 3 and visited various locations up and down the interstate.
"He was out and about. We know he was doing some drinking," Craft said. "He was circulating while he was here."
Houser appears to have visited Lafayette more than once, possibly looking for 'a soft target," he said.
Five people shot by Houser inside the theater remain hospitalized, Craft said. Four have been treated and released.
2 p.m.
Three shooting victims remained hospitalized at Lafayette General Medical Center on Friday, but officials said all three are in stable condition and expected to be released in a few days.
The hospital received five patients from the scene of the shooting Thursday night, said David Callecod, president of Lafayette General Health. Three of the patients were transported by ambulance, while two were brought via private vehicle.
Callecod said all five victims had sustained gunshot wounds. Three were classified as Level One trauma patients, while one was a Level Two trauma patient.
12:18 p.m.
Grand Theater headquarters released this statement following last night's shooting:
“All of us offer our thoughts and prayers to the victims and to the community of Lafayette. We are grateful to all local officials and to the governor for their efforts.”
Grand Theater is one of three brands operated by Southern Theaters, LLC, based in New Orleans.
11:42 a.m.
Reporter Seth Dickerson is out on the street talking to Lafayette residents who are shocked and saddened but strongly believe their community will unite in this tragedy.
"It was tragic. Just to stand up and shoot people, he must have had a mental illness. It was horrific," said Leon Simmons. "I'm hurt. We're a very resilient community. We'll get through this, but we'll have to get through the grieving first."
Nurse Ashley Brinkhaus said the shooting was crazy.
"It hurts to the depths of my soul to know this happened in our own backyard," she said. "We raise our kids here."
Resident Alex Thibodeaux had only one thing to say about the suspect.
"(Houser) was a coward," he said.

Brisbane's central business district is shrouded in dust, hours after Sydneysiders woke to a red haze in a natural phenomenon unlike anything seen before by residents and weather experts.
The storm moved through southern Queensland late this morning and, reducing visibility in Toowoomba and Ipswich to 100 metres. Experts say the dust may reach New Zealand before it settles.
It's just red, red, red as far as you can see
Sydneysiders woke to an eerie red scene this morning, as the sun struggled to pierce a thick blanket of dust cloaking the city this morning.
Meteorologists said the dust would stay until at least late afternoon.

Callers flooded talkback radio, others hit social networking sites and scores emailed Fairfax news website smh.com.au as Sydney residents expressed their amazement at this morning's conditions.
"It's just red, red, red as far as you can see," one caller at the Anzac Bridge told Radio 2GB.
The fiery haze was the result of the sun hitting the blanket of dust, Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Jane Golding said.
"The reason for the dust is we had some really strong winds in the inland areas of NSW and in South Australia for a sustained period yesterday," she said.
"That's lifted a whole lot of dust off the ground because it's quite dry out there, many of those areas are still drought affected."
The lifted dust was carried by the winds into Sydney.
"I've not seen anything like this before," she said.
Bureau of Meteorology’s regional director Barry Hanstrum said strong winds from South Australia had sent dust across the Tasman earlier this month.
"And likewise with this one, there’s a fair chance that it will keep going out into the Tasman Sea and it won’t dissipate quickly," he said.
"They may see some effects of reduced visibility as far east as New Zealand."
The dust caused havoc with Sydney's transport system this morning, with visibility on the roads reduced to just a few hundred metres in some places.
All citybound lanes on the M5 East tunnel were closed because of dust in the tunnel, while Sydney's ferries were also temporarily suspended due to poor visibility on harbour.
The RTA issued a warning urging drivers to exercise caution and reduce speed due to "significant dust over the city affecting visibility".
International and domestic flights at Sydney Airport were delayed as a result of the "strong winds and dust haze," a spokesman said.
A number of incoming international flights had been diverted to Melbourne and Brisbane, although some flights had managed to land in Sydney, he said.
While delays were expected throughout the day, the airport was not closed, contrary to some reports, he said.
Emergency services have been stretched by the conditions, as health experts raised fears about the impact of the dust for people with breathing problems.
The Ambulance Service said it had experienced an increase in calls from asthma sufferers as a result of the dust haze this morning. Some were taken to hospital, a spokeswoman said.
The NSW Fire Brigades received more than 500 calls between 3am and 7am, triggered by automatic fire alarms. It normally receives just 30 in that time period.
"This is one for the books," a spokesman said.
"A lot of fire alarms are particle-type alarms and the dust gets in and sets them off.
"We are flat strap at the moment ... there's going to be a high flow of fire brigade traffic through the metropolitan area today."
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning across the state because of widespread damaging winds, which are expected to increase in force across Sydney this morning.
"It's been close to 60km/h already this morning ... it's just a matter of time before it gets stronger," Ms Golding said.
Wind speeds this morning were expected to average over 65km/h, but there would be gusts in excess of 100 km/h, the bureau said.
The winds would gradually ease over the afternoon and evening, Ms Golding said.
The winds were being whipped up by a cold front that passed through the state yesterday, and a deep low pressure trough over Victoria.
Temperatures were this morning in the low 20s and were expected to remain that way for the rest of the day, Ms Golding said.
Last night, large hailstones fell in parts of Goulburn and Wagga, while wind gusts exceeded 90km/h, the bureau said. A 109km/h gust was reported at Moss Vale.
The NSW State Emergency Service received about 175 calls for help from residents of Crookwell, near Goulburn, as a result of fallen trees and damaged roofs, a spokeswoman said.
Despite sunrise being at 5.43am, the city was still shrouded in a dark reddish haze at 7am this morning.
Many residents took to social networking sites, with Sydney one of the top 10 topics on Twitter this morning.
Public schools across the state were open, an Education Department spokesman said.
"But given the circumstances, if parents are concerned about the effects of the high levels of dust in the air and if their children suffer from asthma or other breathing problems then they can keep their children at home," he said.

The tweet came minutes after Ted Cruz swept through all 34 delegates during the GOP assembly in Colorado Springs on Saturday.

The party deleted the tweet within minutes, saying the message was posted by someone "with unauthorized access to our account."

"We are doing an investigation right now to find out how it got out because we would never do that," Colorado GOP Chairman Steve House told Anne Trujillo and Marshall Zelinger on Politics Unplugged. "There's no point in trying to disenfranchise a campaign [Donald Trump's] that we supported while they were here, and there's no way anybody on my staff -- certainly not me -- would ever put that out," House said.
House wouldn't say how many people on staff have access to the account, but said they "had a process going on to find out who actually knew the password to the account." House added "it's only a matter of time," before they find out who sent that tweet, as they knew the IP address the tweet went out from.
But Trump supporters remained unconvinced, and quickly took to Twitter to decry the message, calling the party corrupt and "busted."

<http://www.thegrand.com/history-of-the-grand/> dct:description """The Grand has a very special place in the history of our community and in the lives of many of our residents. It survived the storms of 1900 and 1915, and Hurricanes Carla and Alicia, as well as years of neglect at various times throughout its history. Of these events, the greatest threat to its survival was the 1900 storm, and it remains a testament to the determination of the people of Galveston that The Grand was quickly repaired and reopened.
The Grand is one of the few remaining theatres of its era in Texas and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As further recognition of its importance to the citizens of Texas, in 1993 the 73rd Texas Legislature proclaimed The Grand “The Official Opera House of Texas“.
Galvestonians exhibited great vision in 1894 when they undertook to support the arts in Galveston by construction of The Grand. A later generation of Galvestonians renewed that commitment with equal vision when they undertook to save and restore The Grand in 1974.
In 1894, Henry Greenwall raised the needed funds of $100,000 for construction with substantial commitments from a handful of prominent businessmen and civic-minded Galvestonians. When $8 million was raised for the Grand’s restoration between 1974 and 1990, it was a remarkable community effort which included the volunteer efforts of literally thousands of residents from Galveston county, the greater Houston area and the state of Texas.
Support came from individuals, the business and corporate community, local government and, of course, included generous foundation support from around the state and nation. Chief among these were the generous leadership gifts of the Harris and Eliza Kempner Fund, The Moody Foundation, Houston Endowment and the subsequent gifts of George and Cynthia Mitchell to help complete the restoration.
Due to the foresight and generosity of several generations of Galvestonians, The Grand stands today as an important linkage to our past and an important part of our future.""" ;

The memories of the carnage are still remembered by the elders who witnessed the incident at that time. The incident has been referred to as the ‘Jallianwala Bagh’ of the south by former Premier P V Narasimha Rao. On September 2, 1947, 69 years ago, a patriotic desire to hoist national flag in Parkal, then a small village in Warangal district, had ended a brutal massacre committed by Razakars. The memories of the carnage are still remembered by the elders who witnessed the incident at that time. The incident has been referred to as the ‘Jallianwala Bagh’ of the south by former Premier P V Narasimha Rao.
It may be recalled that after Indian Independence on August 15, 1947, erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad denied joining Indian Union and also enforced suppression against hoisting the tri-colour employing tyrannical army of Razakars. Anguished at not being allowed to hoist the national flag, the residents of Parkal and surrounding villages planned to raise the flag on September 2 to celebrate the Independence and gathered near a ground in Parkal. But an official of Nizams’ regime Ziauallah Khan cautioned the public to disperse.
But the public charged with patriotic fervour went ahead to hoist the flag. Then the Nizam’s police resorted to lathi charge and then opened fire killing people indiscriminately, explained nonagenarians Basani Murari and Reguri Chandra Reddy who witnessed the incident. “The Razakars ambushed those who wanted to hoist the flag and fired at them killing about 13 persons at Parkal and nine persons at other places,” they told The Hans India recalling the tales of dictatorial rule of Nizams.
“Everyone wanted to be liberated from Nizam’s tyranny as they are not allowed to hoist the national flag though the country was liberated from the rule of the British,” said freedom fighters P Veeraswamy and P Vaikuntam. According to Vaikuntam, Razakars tied three people to a tree and shot them brutally at Rangapuram village and they looted gold and money and molested women at Laxmipuram and set the village on fire.
“The history of Parkal massacre and other such incidents has to be included in the school text books and Telangana Liberation Day should be celebrated officially. The State government should take initiative in this direction,” they urged. “Successive governments have failed to acknowledge the Telangana Liberation Movement and honour the martyrs by officially celebrating Telangana Liberation Day. It is sad that even in separate Telangana it is not happening,” they lamented.
In 2003, former Union minister and present Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had built a memorial called ‘Amaradhamam’ at Parkal paying tributes to the massacre victims. The memorial was built in memory of his mother by Chennamaneni Chandramma Trust of Karimnagar. Incidentally, the back cover of the book titled ‘Uniki’ authored by Vidyasagar Rao and released by President Pranab Mukherjee some time back, features a picture of ‘Amaradhamam’ as a mark of respect to those who laid down their lives to fulfil their desire to hoist the national flag.""" ;

<http://www.thepalmettopanther.com/ultra-music-festival-brings-techno-to-miami/> dct:description """Thousands of fist-pumping people, world-renowned deejays, ear-shattering trebles, bone-vibrating basses, eye-catching lightshows. Welcome to Ultra.
Ultra Music Festival (UMF) began in 1999. It picked up speed in 2002 when the single-day event sold 21,500 tickets and earned over $1 million, according to Pollstar USA. Eight years later, UMF sold close to 100,000 tickets and earned $7 million.
Previously, spectators would travel from around the globe to attend both Miami’s Winter Music Conference and UMF, occurring consecutively. Now, with the events two weeks apart, attendance and lodging become prominent issues.
Ultra officials blame the “split” on Miami’s Calle Ocho celebration on March 13. According to city officials, Ultra requires 100 policemen and Calle Ocho needs close to 400, making simultaneous occurrences impossible. Because Ultra will last three days, it had to reschedule to the last weekend of March.
Ultra has signed exclusivity agreements with many of its artists, restricting deejays’ freedom and creating drama within the music industry. In short, these “exclusive” agreements inhibit artists from performing anywhere except at Ultra. In rebellion, Swedish House Mafia chose to host their own “One-Night Stand” that will take place on March 26.
“Ultra could easily compromise, have a two-day event, and everyone would be happy. Instead, Ultra officials make it three days and two weeks later than WMC,” senior Erin Gorsline said. “I don’t think it is right, especially because, without WMC, they would be nonexistent.”
Aside from individuals’ skepticism, many aspects of Ultra stay unchanged. Bayfront Park will remain as the traditional UMF setting, even though officials fenced off four of the park’s thirty acres for construction on a new museum. Attendees can also expect the hundred-foot tall main stage with its towering speakers, laser- and strobe- light shows, over six side stages covered with tents, and hundreds of thousands of attendants raving to the chest-vibrating music.
“Regardless of everything Ultra does and of all the changes people are making, I know Ultra will be amazing,” senior Georgette Finnegan said. “It’s not just about the music either; it’s about chilling with friends and making memories.”
Techno-cravers can expect to see newbie performances. Ultra plans to introduce “Super Mash Bros.,” mainly known for its hip-hop mash-ups; “Empire of the Sun,” a group many believe, with its performance, will gain popularity; “Cut Copy;” and “!!!” The returning artists- “Tiesto,” “deadmau5,” “David Guetta,” “carlcox” and “Afrojack”- will have competition.
UMF has become one of the highest attended and most widely-known music events in the United States. “Early-bird” specials on ticket prices sold out within hours of being released. After only two days, online ticket sales soared 500 percent higher than 2010 ticket sales. People can buy tickets on UMF’s website.""" ;

May 31, 1985 outbreak: How a 'lost' 14th tornado was found
Find Your Forecast Search for a location
Scott Sutherland
Meteorologist/Science Writer
Tuesday, May 31, 2016, 12:06 PM - On the final day of May 1985, a destructive and deadly swarm of tornadoes swept through southern Ontario, however for years, one of these twisters was lost from the public record. Here's how it was found.
Tuesday, May 31, 2016 marks the 31st anniversary of Southern Ontario's Black Friday, when a devastating tornado outbreak damaged thousands of buildings, caused hundreds of injuries, and claimed the lives of a dozen people before it was over.
In the aftermath of the outbreak, a total of 13 confirmed tornadoes went into the official record of the day:
• an F1 that touched down near Essa, west of Barrie, at 4:57 p.m.
• eight different F2 tornadoes, in Hopeness, Hopeville, Lisle, Wagner Lake, Reaboro, Ida, Rice Lake and Minto, scattered between 3 p.m. and 6:35 p.m.
• two F3 tornadoes, in Alma at 4:15 p.m. and Corbetton at 4:17 p.m.
• two F4 tornadoes, one starting in Grand Valley at 4:15 p.m., and tracking over 115 km to Tottenham (the longest tornado track in Canadian weather history), and one that touched down in Barrie at 5 p.m., cutting a swath through the city that damaged or destroyed up to 300 homes, and resulted in 155 injuries and 8 dead.
According to Geoff Coulson, Environment Canada's Warning Preparedness Meteorologist, there were other strong storms that swept through the area on that day. At the time, however, no other tornado reports made it into the official record.
Credit: Animation by S. Sutherland, from slides provided by Environment Canada
As revealed in the animation above, though, there was actually one more - a "lost" F1 tornado, which had touched down far to the east of the other twisters from that day, at around 8:10 p.m., near Grippen Lake, about 35 kilometres northeast of Kingston.
Lost and found
Severe weather experts work quickly to investigate tornado reports. In most cases, if not all, this involves travelling to the location to assess the damage first-hand.
From this close investigation, the experts can learn two important pieces of information: 1) the pattern of the damage, which will reveal if it was actually caused by a tornado (as opposed to some other weather phenomenon, such as a downburst) and 2) an estimate of how strong the winds were, which allows them to classify the strength if a tornado is confirmed (on the Fujita scale in the past, and now the enhanced Fujita scale).
In addition to this case-by-case forensic work, scientists with Environment Canada - such as Severe Weather Scientist David Sills - are also working to maintain the most complete database of tornado activity in Canada.
It was the effort by Sills and his colleagues, as they combed through the collected reports in both the Ontario Tornado Database (which stretches back to 1792) and the Canada Tornado Database (currently covering 1980 to 2009), that uncovered this "lost" tornado from May 31, 1985.
"The Kingston Weather Office (closed in the 1990’s) investigated a report of damage on 31 May 1985 at Grippen Lake," Sills wrote in an email to The Weather Network. "A short, but very narrow path of damage was found, mainly large trees snapped and uprooted, but a small boat was thrown and cottages were damaged by the falling trees."
According to Sills, the report from the Kingston office did indicate that the damage was caused by an F1 tornado, however there was no indication as to why the report was not included in the official record for the day.
Damage was also reported in the Ottawa Valley later that night, however, it was not attributed to a tornado. Instead, this damage was most likely due to a downburst.
Tornado? Downburst? What's the difference?
Like tornadoes, downbursts can cause significant damage, but they are caused by a very different process than a tornado, and the type of damage they cause is different as well.
When a storm moves into an area with dry air, rain and hail falling from the base of the cloud evaporates before it hits the ground. This process draws a large amount of heat out of the air. The drier the air, the more evaporation, and thus the colder the air will become. Since colder air is heavier than warmer air, this chilled air plummets towards the ground. In extreme cases the winds generated by this plummeting air can reach speeds of over 100 kilometres per hour - the equivalent strength of an F1 tornado, or EF0 tornado under the newer enhanced Fujita scale.
One way to tell a downburst from a tornado is to check Doppler radar signatures, as they show up looking very different from one another. In the absence of Doppler radar, though, the damage pattern will look different as well. Downbursts tend to blow things over all in the same direction, while tornadoes whip debris around it, producing a very distinct pattern.
Why Does This Matter?
Tornadoes are significant and dangerous events, so studying them is of great importance to the scientific community.
However, what difference does it make that one small tornado was added to this record? Why spend time and resources to catalogue and refine databases of Canadian tornadoes, even going so far as to revise events years and even decades after the fact?
For example, according to Sills:
"The 1970 Sudbury tornado used to have an extremely long track in the Ontario tornado database - much longer than any other track in Canada. We went back to the source data and were able to break the one tornado into three much shorter pieces and remove a long section of track where the data were very sparse. That now leaves the Grand Valley–Tottenham tornado from 31 May 1985 as the longest tornado track in Canada at 115 km."
Part of this is to expand our understanding of tornadoes, the conditions that spawn them, how often these conditions occur in Canada, and where they are most likely to form. This helps in forecasting these events, to keep the public safer from harm.
It goes far beyond that, though, as the information being collected is also used for student projects and university-level research, as well as by the insurance and risk assessment industries, the nuclear industry and by provincial and municipal organizations.
The data collected can also be used in climate studies, to reveal how tornado activity may change in a warming world.

<http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,93313,00.html> dct:description """Every few weeks for six years, Michael McDermott drove up to an hour to Dedham, Mass., to donate blood platelets. He went to the Red Cross there because it was the only one in the area with the equipment required for the involved procedure--which takes two hours, about twice as long as ordinary blood donation. McDermott gave voluntarily, receiving no payment in return. On the lower right of his car's rear bumper, he pasted a sticker: give blood.
But last week McDermott chose to draw blood. The morning after Christmas, McDermott, 42, dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans, was chatting about video games with a colleague at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield, Mass., where he wrote code for and tested the company's software. Just after 11 a.m., however, he strolled through the lobby with an AK-47 assault rifle, shotgun and semiautomatic pistol. When a co-worker asked, "Where are you going with that?" he responded, "Human resources." He then shot to death two employees at reception, headed down the hall to the human-resources department, picked off three people and proceeded to accounting, where three other workers were barricaded. McDermott blasted through the door and gunned down two. (The third employee survived by concealing herself beneath a desk.) "No one saw it coming," said a former employee who asked to remain anonymous. "I was talking to one guy who was sitting in the conference room when the first bullets were fired. The bullets flew through the glass. They had no idea what was going on. They hit the ground, and one individual had glass all in his hair." McDermott then returned to the lobby, sat in a chair within reach of a black tote bag packed with ammunition and waited for the police.
Money troubles seem to have triggered his rampage. The burly engineer hunted down the two departments--accounting and human resources--that were about to garnishee his wages to pay overdue taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. McDermott had complained to colleagues about the garnishment and had asked for a cash advance a week before Christmas. The request was denied by one of the victims. The last straw, however, may have been a call he received at 11:07 a.m. on the day of the shooting. A Chrysler representative informed him that his 1994 Plymouth was going to be repossessed. According to the Boston Globe, he responded blithely, "I won't be needing it. Come pick it up."
There had been one warning. Haverhill police received a call at 11:40 p.m. on Christmas Eve reporting gunshots. Investigators learned that a man driving a sedan with the license plate MUCKO had been spotted in a wooded area where they later found a handful of shotgun shells. McDermott was nicknamed "Mucko" by a nephew who couldn't pronounce his first name. "We didn't encounter McDermott," says Sergeant Stephen Brighi. "If luck had been on our side, history could have possibly been changed."
The second of Richard and Rosemary Martinez's four children, McDermott exchanged his Hispanic surname for a slight variation on his middle one (McDermod) in 1980, four years after he joined the Navy. He served on the nuclear submarine U.S.S. Narwhal, an assignment that required rigorous psychological screening. However, says Bruce Joy, one of his crewmates, "when somebody violated his personal space and got too close to him he responded by sneezing directly in the guy's face." Even so, says Joy, "in the bizarre world of the submarine community there was nothing that would suggest that he would do what he did." McDermott worked as a nuclear-reactor operator at the Maine Yankee plant after leaving the Navy but abandoned the highly specialized job after six years of training, just when it should have begun paying dividends.
It is unclear what he did for the next few years, but he eventually joined the Duracell company and married a childhood sweetheart, Monica Sheehan. McDermott summed up that experience in 1997 on a website for Narwhal veterans: "Well, I came back to the land of my youth and married a childhood friend. Lasted three and a half years before she split." His wife moved away to a Chicago suburb. In the meantime, the man who had met the strict weight limits to work on a sub ballooned to 350 lbs.
The answering machine at his one-bedroom apartment the day after the killing went, "Hello, this is Michael's computer. Here I am...brain the size of a planet, and what does he have me doing?...answering the phone." It was a playful reference to the sci-fi cult classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In his home, police found fuses, blasting caps and three gallons of nitric acid in a cardboard box labeled DANGEROUS: DO NOT MOVE. McDermott had a firearms-identification card for rifles and shotguns that expired in 1999. Neighbors remember him as an unsmiling presence, but by Christmas he seemed to be in good spirits. "I've never seen him cheery, but he was acting cheery on Christmas," says his neighbor Kevin Forzese.""" ;

<http://www.timesofisrael.com/islamic-state-claims-deadly-hotel-attack-in-tunisia/> dct:description """Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said Saturday he had ordered the closure of dozens of mosques throughout the country responsible for incitement, as the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a massacre in a seaside resort a day earlier.
At a news conference at his office in the capital Tunis, Essid said he would immediately close around 80 mosques outside the control of the ministry of religious affairs and call army reservists into active service and place them around the country.
“No mosque that does not confirm to the law will be tolerated,” he said.

Essid announced new anti-terrorism measures, including the deployment of reserve troops to reinforce security at “sensitive sites … and places that could be targets of terrorist attacks.”
The “exceptional plan to better secure tourist and archaeological sites” will include “deploying armed tourist security officers all along the coast and inside hotels from 1 July,” he added.
Friday’s attack killed nearly 40 people, most of them British tourists, in the worst attack in the country’s recent history.
Dozens more were wounded when a man pulled a gun from inside a beach umbrella and opened fire on crowds of tourists at the five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel in the popular Mediterranean resort of Port el Kantaoui.
Essid said 38 people had been killed, revising down an earlier toll of 39 given by the health ministry. An official there told AFP the original figure had included the dead gunman.
Most of those killed were from Britain – implying this could be the biggest loss of British life in a militant attack since the July 2005 bombings in London when 52 died – while Germans, Belgians, French were also among the dead, the premier said .
Britain’s Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said earlier five Britons had been killed and he expected the toll to rise, while his Irish counterpart confirmed an Irish woman was among the dead.
The attack, the second against tourists in Tunisia this year, comes on the same day that 27 people were killed at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and a suspected Islamist attacked a factory in France.
IS claimed both the bombing and the attack in Tunisia, which came at the start of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan and just days before the first anniversary of the group declaring its territory in Iraq and Syria a “caliphate”.
IS said the gunman, who they identified as Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, was a “solider of the caliphate” who had targeted enemies of the jihadist group and “dens (of …) fornication, vice and apostasy”.
Most of those killed were “subjects of states that make up the crusader alliance fighting the state of the caliphate”, the group said in a statement released on Twitter, referring to the group of countries that have been bombarding its positions in the Middle East.
The attack, along with the killings in France and Kuwait, sparked a chorus of international condemnation with the White House vowing to “fight the scourge of terrorism” and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon saying those responsible for the “appalling” attacks ” must be swiftly brought to justice “.
Tunisian Secretary of State for Security Rafik Chelly told Mosaique FM the gunman was a Tunisian student previously unknown to the authorities.
“He entered by the beach, dressed like someone who was going to swim, and he had a beach umbrella with his gun in it. Then when he came to the beach he used his weapon,” Chelly said.
Witnesses described scenes of panic after the shooting at the hotel on the outskirts of Sousse, about 140 kilometres (90 miles) south of the capital Tunis.
“All I saw was a gun and an umbrella being dropped,” British tourist Ellie Makin told ITV television.
“Then he started firing to the right-hand side of us. If he had fired to the left I do not know what would have happened, but we were very lucky.”
The shooting was the worst in modern-day Tunisia and followed a March attack claimed by IS on Tunis’s Bardo National Museum that killed 21 foreign tourists and a policeman.
British tourist Gary Pine told Britain’s Sky News television Friday’s attack happened when the beach was packed. He counted 20-30 shots.
“My son was in the sea at the time and of course my wife and myself were shouting for him to get out the sea quick and as we ran up the beach he said: ‘I just saw someone get shot’.”
Briton Olivia Leathley, 24, heard “loud bangs” and when she went to the lobby to find out what was happening, she saw a woman whose husband had “been shot in the stomach in front of her”.
“All she said was that he’d been shot and that he was there bleeding on the beach and he was just saying, ‘I love you, I love you’, and then his eyes rolled back into his head.”
Another woman described how her fiance was shot three times while trying to protect her and was in intensive care in hospital.
“I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started,” 26-year-old holidaymaker Saera Wilson told the BBC.
By the early hours of Saturday morning, hundreds of tourists were arriving at Enfidha airport in a mad scramble to leave the country, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.
Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi told AFP that his country can not stand up to the jihadist threat alone, and urged a unified global strategy.
In Cairo, leading Sunni Muslim institution Al-Azhar called the “heinous” shooting a “violation of all religious and humanitarian norms”.
Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring, has seen a surge in radical Islam since veteran president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in the 2011 revolution.
Dozens of members of the security forces have been killed in jihadist attacks since then.
In October 2013, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a botched attack on a Sousse beach while security forces foiled another planned attack nearby.
Even before the latest attack, Tunisia’s tourism industry had been bracing for a heavy blow from the Bardo shooting, but was determined to attract tourists with new security measures and advertising.
Tourism accounts for seven percent of Tunisia’s GDP and almost 400,000 direct and indirect jobs.""" ;

Footage obtained by Sky News on Saturday showed him walking calmly along the beach. Sky said the clip was filmed after the massacre, and noted that no members of the Tunisian security forces approached him. He was later shot dead in a confrontation in a side street, the report said.
Authorities identified the attacker as Seifedinne Rezgui, a 23-year-old electrical engineering student from Gaafour, in northwest Tunisia. He was a student at Kairouan University, a city just south of Sousse where the killings occurred.

His bewildered family described a quiet, not-too-religious young man who liked soccer, music and spent time with friends. They said that they last saw him a day before the attack and that nothing seemed amiss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-WYcvngLz4
“We were all shocked when we heard the news and saw his picture, and his mother was devastated,” an uncle told The Telegraph Saturday.
“Yes, he went to mosque and prayed, but just like the other young men, he would then go to a cafe and play football with his friends. I last saw him on Thursday, he said ‘hello’, and then he left that night and went to his friend’s house. We didn’t know where he was going, and there were no goodbye’s. The entire family is shocked at the hidden reality of what he was capable of,” he added.
According to the report, a Facebook account believed to have belonged to Rezgui showed a love for Real Madrid and rap music, but also an admiration for the Islamic State. Several propaganda videos were also posted to the page.
“He used to use hair gel and wear the nicest of clothes, and he used to break dancing [sic]” the uncle said. “He even used to go to competitions and things like that in Tunis, he was well known for that here. He didn’t even have a beard, and I’ve never seen him with anyone with a beard. Now he’s shooting people with a Kalashnikov, it’s just so confusing.”
On Saturday, the Islamic State, which took responsibility for the attack, circulated a photograph it said was of Rezgui online. He is seated on the floor, smiling and flanked by Kalashnikovs. He was described by the group as a “soldier of the caliphate.”
Witnesses of the attack Friday described a “very, very calm” demeanor by Rezgui as he shot beach goers after going for a swim in the ocean. The attack was said to have lasted at least 30 minutes.
Warning: Graphic footage in clip below
Rezgui, who was later killed by police, reportedly carried one of those same rifles concealed in a beach umbrella into the the crowd of hotel guests and opened fire.
On Saturday, additional footage of the massacre obtained by Sky News show Rezgui calmly walking along the beach with his weapon in hand as horrified beachgoers look on.
Witnesses said he chose his victims carefully and told Tunisians to get out of the way as he continued his killing spree. Most of the victims were tourists. Fifteen Britons were confirmed among the dead by Saturday night.
According to Sky News, some Tunisians who were not targeted by Rezgui, pleaded with him to stop, asking him “why are you killing these people?”
He responded to them by saying “well, at least I’m not killing you,” and walked away.""" ;

According to the report, it is not yet clear whether Ramazanova brought the two explosives she used in the attack from Syria or if she acquired them from members of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
The Hürriyet report included details about Ramazanova's life leading up to the attack. She reportedly became acquainted with a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin by the name of Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev through social media. The two became friends and later decided to get married and move to Syria to join ISIL.
Ramazanova is seen in an undated photo.
Ramazanova and Edelbijev crossed the Turkish border into Syria after a three-month honeymoon in İstanbul. After Edelbijev was killed in a fight in December 2014, Ramazanova decided to come back to Turkey and illegally crossed the border into the southeastern province of Gaziantep on Dec. 26, 2014. She then traveled to İstanbul via a rented car. It is not clear how or where Ramazanova acquired to explosives she used in the attack.
Main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) deputy Atilla Kart has said that the number of those who have joined ISIL from Turkey has increased. According to Kart, the number of ISIL sympathizers in Turkey was 3,000, according to figures in August 2014, but has grown to 10,000 recently. “They are mainly concentrated in Gaziantep, Hatay and Kilis,” Kart was quoted as saying by the Taraf daily.
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) Hatay deputy Şefik Çirkin has warned that the number of ISIL militants in Turkey has been increasing. “The AK Party's [Justice and Development Party] grassroots are sympathizers of ISIL,” Çirkin said, adding: “However, we cannot blame them. The main suspect is the government.”
Referring to unidentified sources, Çirkin said 12,000 Turkish citizens have joined ISIL so far. He also drew attention to the fact that so far Turkish authorities have not led any operations against members or sympathizers of ISIL in the country and that the militant group has not been the subject of discussion in any sessions of the National Security Council (MGK).""" ;

Association for the Support of Greek Foundations President Laki Vingas and Secretary-General Katerina Proku Türker filed a complained with the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK), which audits TV broadcasts, regarding the negative portrayal of Greeks on TV shows. In their written statement, Vingas and Türker gave the TV show “Ustura Kemal” as the latest example of such a trend. According to the complaint, “Certain characters displayed on the show lead to discomfort in members of the Greek community who live in Turkey as citizens of this country. All negative characters such as prostitutes, traitors and collaborators are portrayed as Greeks.”
The complaint further said that sociologists and anthropologists have agreed that throughout history flaws such as prostitution, theft and homicide could exist in any society because human beings are prone to mistakes as it urged people not to attribute those to any ethnicity or society.
Drawing attention to the fact that tens of thousands of Greek people had to leave Turkey in the past due to negative profiling in newspapers and the film industry (Yeşilçam), Vingas said that current popular TV shows aired in prime time are equally disturbing for Greek citizens.
Vingas also said, “Nobody has the right to insult the Greek community like this -- people who serve Turkey as law-abiding citizens of this country as doctors, academics, architects, engineers, lawyers, artists and businessmen.” He also expressed discomfort at the possible biases of “Greece's next-door neighbors and their negative perceptions."
On behalf of the Greek community, Vingas urged RTÜK to warn the channel that airs the TV show that leads to discomfort and asked for more sensitivity towards minorities in future projects.
RTÜK reportedly shared the complaint with the TV channel that airs the show.""" ;

The document signed by major general Mehmet Göktan, head of intelligence department for the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) which has been circulating on social media notes that a bomb placed in a backpack will be dropped in a pre-designated area by a teen who appears to be Syrian. The document identifies the terrorist Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) as the culprit of the possible attack.
The document warns that necessary security precautions should be taken regarding the threat including obtaining further information on the possible attack and security measures in the vicinity near Bahçelievler, which is around 1.5 kilometers from Kızılay square.
“We have received information that the separatist terror organization [PKK] may use a Syrian-looking teenager to leave a backpack laden with explosives to a site near Ankara Bahçelievler 7th Avenue, in front of buildings, facilities and lodging belonging to public institutions” the intelligence report reads.
Ankara was rocked for a third time in six months on Sunday, as a bomb went off in the commercial district of Kızılay at around 6.45 pm. Eyewitnesses claim on social media that the explosion took place as an explosive-laden vehicle crashed into a bus from behind near Güvenpark, Kızılay.
The Ankara Governor’s Office announced that there are at least 27 dead and 75 injured from the attack. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) immediately imposed a media ban on the explosion.""" ;

The Secretary-General Message to ceremonony and International Forum commemorating the 65th anniversary of the tragedy of Babi Yar, delivered by Mr. Francis O’Donnell, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine,on 27 September 2006.
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
--
MESSAGE TO CEREMONY AND INTERNATIONAL FORUM
COMMEMORATING THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGEDY OF BABYN YAR
As delivered by Mr. Francis O’Donnell, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine,
at 5.45pm on 27 September 2006
Your Excellencies,
President Yushchenko of Ukraine
President Katsav of Israel,
President Mesic of Croatia,
President Vujanovic of Montenegro,
Members of Governments and Parliaments,
Chief Rabbis and other religious authorities,
Ambassadors and other distinguished guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my distinct honour on this tragic commemoration of the massacre of Babi Yar to deliver the following statement on behalf of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan:
I quote:
The massacre of many thousands of Jews, Soviet prisoners of war, Ukrainian nationalists, Roma and others at Babyn Yar was one of the worst horrors of the Second World War. If we are to have any chance of sparing future generations from similar tragedies, we must keep memory alive.
I recall vividly my own visit to the site four years ago. I felt the truth of the line in Yevtushenko’s famous poem, “Here all things scream silently”.
I wanted to go to Babyn Yar to express my solidarity with all victims of anti-Semitism and intolerance, and as a sign of my resolve to do everything in my power to fight the hatred and evil that continue to disfigure our world. Indeed, even today, after the Holocaust and other horrors of the last century, we see people around the world targeted for brutality and violence simply because of their ethnic, religious, national or other identity. We see Jews in many places, including in Europe, living in fear for their safety and freedoms. We see Muslims and others facing attacks and discrimination. Politicians in several countries have found anti-immigrant appeals a path to electoral success. In the past few years especially, there has been an increase in extremism and intolerance.
Such threats, whether large-scale genocide to the indignities of day-to-day bigotry, should trouble all of us. We must each strive to uphold the principles of tolerance, pluralism, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. Communities under assault must not be left alone to defend themselves. We must reject the false claims of those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated. Everyone must speak out. The United Nations, for its part, in addition to its wide-ranging, long-standing work to promote and protect human rights, has launched an “Alliance of Civilizations”, aimed at bridging divides, and at overcoming prejudices and polarizations that potentially threaten world peace.
Remembering the unspeakable acts that took place at Babyn Yar is an essential part of that work. I commend President Yushchenko for his leadership in convening this important commemoration, and I thank all the participants for their commitment. Please accept my best wishes for a moving and memorable ceremony.
*******
This concludes the statement of the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan.
Having observed this day’s commemorative ceremonies, I would like to finish by adding how important it is for all of us to understand the words of that special prayer sung today in Hebrew by the Chief Rabbi [of Tel Aviv-Yafo], namely [ending]:
O’seh shalom bim romav, hu ya’aseh shalom aleynu
Let He who makes peace in the heavens, grant peace to all of us
ve’al kol Yisrael. [and to all Israel]
Shalom aleichem, shalom khaverim, lehitra’ot. [Peace be with you; peace, friends, farewell]
Toda roba [Thank you/ Hebrew]
Duzhe Djakuyu [Thank you / Ukrainian]

Officials said Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old Los Angeles man, used an assault rifle to kill a TSA agent and wound several others about 9:20 a.m. PDT.

Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon told reporters at a news conference the man pulled the gun out of a bag at a security checkpoint and started shooting, and then kept shooting at other locations before police shot him at the airport's Terminal 3 and took him into custody.
"At this point we believe this was a lone shooter," Gannon said.
RELATED Students return to Nevada school after shooting
Police said seven people were treated on the scene for injuries and six were hospitalized.
Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism officials were on the scene, but sources told the Los Angeles Times investigators were not aware of any ties to terrorist groups.
Police said Ciancia, who formerly lived in Pennsville, N.J., had written materials in his possession suggesting he held strong anti-government views.
The alleged gunman was not a TSA employee, as initial reports indicated.
Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings told NBC News in Philadelphia Ciancia had texted his brother in New Jersey prior to the shooting that he was contemplating suicide.
Leon Saryan, a witness, told MSNBC Ciancia, brandishing his weapon, was walking calmly through a terminal when he asked Saryan if he worked for the TSA.
RELATED Middle school shooter said to have been bullied
"All he said was, 'TSA?' Just like that," Saryan said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, which was evacuated.
Vernon Cardenas, 45, of West Hollywood, told the Times he was at the airport for a trip to Philadelphia.
"Sitting down, all of a sudden, literally just out of the blue, you hear a rumble in the background and a couple of seconds later, people are running at me," said Cardenas, who is involved in casting for the Fox reality show "MasterChef."
Federal authorities told NBC News the shooter had a rifle or other long gun. A large box of ammunition was at the scene, a law enforcement official said.
The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad was trying to clear suspicious packages.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the situation at the airport had become "static" but he still cautioned people to stay away from the area, as no passengers were being permitted to go into the airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered flights grounded at LAX, the third-busiest U.S. airport and the sixth-busiest in the world, with 1,500 departing and arriving flights daily.
"Due to OTHER / SECURITY and GATE ISSUES and GATE ISSUES, there is a Traffic Management Program in effect for traffic arriving Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, CA [LAX]," a message posted on the FAA website said. "To see if you may be affected, select your departure airport and check 'Delays by Destination.'"
FlightStats, a website that tracks air traffic, said 133 flights had been canceled by mid-afternoon, including 68 departures and 65 arrivals. It said the main road to LAX was closed to all but emergency vehicles, and some inbound flights were being diverted to other airports in the area while other inbound flights were not being allowed to take off from their originating airports.
Delays and cancellations are likely to persist, even after LA reopens, the website said.
LAX was already crowded when the shooting began, due to flight cancellations caused by bad weather affecting major East Coast airports, including Logan International Airport in Boston, LaGuardia Airport in New York and Philadelphia International Airport.
President Barack Obama, following a White House meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, said: "Obviously, we've been monitoring, and we're concerned about it. But I'll let the law enforcement folks talk about it directly."
"We will continue stay in touch with our federal and local partners," a White House spokesman said. "The LAPD is leading the response and investigation. We urge citizens to listen to the authorities and follow directions from the first responders on site. The president will continue to receive briefings throughout the day."
Tory Belleci of the cable television show "Mythbusters" tweeted: "Heard gun shots then everyone starting running for the door. Not sure if anyone was hurt. #LAX.\"""" ;

The power outage also shut down the printing presses for the Seattle Times and Post Intelligencer newspapers, and rail services between Seattle and Portland were suspended.

<http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Blasts-Kill-Dozens-in-Iraq-as-Political-Crisis-Continues-136054818.html> dct:description """A series of bomb blasts hit the Iraqi capital Thursday, leaving at least 63 dead and more than 180 wounded. The attacks came as Iraq is gripped in a political crisis between Shi'ite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Sunni political rivals in the government.
Ambulances ferried casualties to hospitals across Baghdad following the multiple explosions that seemed to target mostly Shi'ite areas. Witnesses say most of the apparently coordinated attacks occurred as people were heading off to work.
Iraqi government TV indicated that four explosions were of car bombs, while 10 were the result of roadside bombs. Baghdad's security chief said police found and disabled six other car bombs before they exploded.
The Sunni Arab satellite channel al Baghdadiya also reported failed assassination attempts against a top central bank official and a police general, and a rocket attack in a Shi'ite neighborhood.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility.
Hassan, a witness to one of the bomb blasts, complained that innocent civilians were paying the price of quarrels among politicians. He warns politicians to stop making innocent people pay for their disagreements.
VOA spoke to Al Hurra’s Hiba Hisham shortly after Thursday’s explosions in Baghdad. She says streets across the capital were blocked, and it took her coworkers four hours to reach the office instead of the usual 10 minutes. However, she said Iraqis are used to attacks, so Baghdad residents will probably not change their daily routines. When vice president Tariq al-Hashemi was accused of involvement in terrorist activities, Iraqis feared violence could escalate. But she said no one expected so many bombings in one day.
The terror attacks come during the political crisis which erupted this week when Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite, tried to arrest Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, accusing him of involvement in terrorist plots. Hashemi then fled to Kurdistan in northern Iraq.
Maliki demanded Wednesday that Kurdish leaders hand Hashemi over for prosecution of his alleged crimes. Kurdistan regional President Massoud Barzani is refusing to do so.
Hashemi, for his part, claims that the charges against him are trumped up, telling VOA that the conflict is the result of outside pressure from both Iran and Syria on Prime Minister Maliki.
Hashemi says the neighboring countries are not pleased with his some of his recent statements and are behind what he calls the fabrication of the entire crisis, and the escalating media campaign against him.
The prime minister's spokesman, Ali Dabbagh, retorted that Vice President Hashemi, and not Maliki, was turning the crisis into a media circus.
He says Hashemi should make his case before the judicial system, and not in front of the press. He insists that TV is turning the matter into a dangerous political crisis.
Middle East analyst James Denselow of King's College London says that Mr. Maliki is trying to “force through his own agenda....now that the U.S. has withdrawn.” But, he argues, it's still too soon to conclude that the political process in Iraq has unraveled.
"In the past, these things have happened and people have backed down when they've realized that their own interests won't be secured by undermining the entire edifice as a whole. So I believe that cooler heads may prevail once saber-rattling has stopped," Denselow said.
Iraq's parliament speaker is due to meet with top political leaders within the next 24 hours in a bid to resolve the rapidly escalating conflict.""" ;

HUNTSVILLE, AL (WAFF) - More information came out in a Saturday press conference on campus, where Dr. Amy Bishop-Anderson works as an assistant professor of biology.
Campus is open next week, but there won't be any classes.
We also know more about the investigation, where and when the gun was recovered and that the shooting happened just as the meeting was coming to a close.
We learned the teacher was denied tenure months ago and might have recently been denied an appeal and allegedly took her anger out at a faculty meeting.
University officials say that meeting had nothing to do with her status there.
3:00 p.m. - A group of 12 convenes for a biological sciences faculty meeting at the Shelby Center.
3:57 p.m. - a call comes into 911 reporting a shooting with multiple injuries.
4:00 p.m. - first responders were at the scene.
"Minutes later, we had a suspect in custody," Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said.
UA-Huntsville's police chief said officers determined there wasn't a threat to the rest of campus by 4:10 p.m. and at 4:42 p.m., the campus was notified there had been a shooting through email.
9:15 p.m.- law enforcement recovers the weapon: a 9mm in a bathroom on the second floor.
45-year-old Amy Bishop-Anderson is now facing one count of capital murder.
"The basis for that is the intentional killing of two or more people during one course of conduct," Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said.
Broussard also said more charges could be forthcoming, including attempted murder as the investigation unfolds.
WAFF 48 News asked if the suspect's husband, Jim Anderson, who was considered a person of interest Friday, had any involvement?
"We have not charged him," Reyes answered. "We have interviewed him, but at this point, we don't have anything specific on him. The only thing we had was the fact that she called him to come pick him up."
"If there is some kind of complicity on another's part, then they too will be charged," Broussard pointed out.
Police won't discuss a motive, but say Bishop-Anderson didn't have a permit to carry a gun.
Police commended not only the quick response efforts by law enforcement and medical personnel, but also others who were inside the Shelby Center at the time of the shooting.
"There were some actions taken by citizens yesterday [Friday] that we can think directly correctly to preserving lives in that room," Sgt. Mark Roberts of the Huntsville Police Department said.
Officers wouldn't elaborate, but say those efforts saved lives.
Overnight, investigators maintained a presence at her south Huntsville home gathering evidence to see if this crime was planned.
Friday night, we also talked to a neighbor who told us he saw the couple leaving their home Friday afternoon with duffel bags.
WAFF 48 News is also told their children are staying with other family.
There are several grief counselors on campus working with students.
"The degree of outpouring has been such that we have more counselors than students requesting help at this moment," UA-Huntsville President Dave Williams said.
Williams said there has been an overwhelming outpour of support from the community to help those in need.
Sunday at noon, there will be a prayer service at the University Center for anyone who would like to attend.
Bishop-Anderson is expected to appear for her preliminary hearing in about six weeks to two months.
Bond has not been set.
Several students have emailed our newsroom, asking why the university didn't notify them sooner of a school shooting.
So we posed that question to the university's police chief.
"This was a very rapidly evolving situation where we had officers responding and trying to assess exactly what was going on. Things were happening very rapidly, had a suspect in custody very quickly and that kept it to that building and those circumstances and eliminated a threat," UA-Huntsville Police Chief Chuck Gailes said.
He adds administrators will re-evaluate their plan and see if improvements are needed.

<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/navy-looking-at-security-changes-after-chattanooga/> dct:description """CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) - The U.S. Navy is looking into possible security changes after the July 16 slaying of four Marines and a sailor at Chattanooga’s U.S. Naval and Marine Reserve Center.
Capt. Jack Hanzlik, Fleet Forces Command spokesman, told the Chattanooga Times Free Press (https://bit.ly/1Vlr9cj ) the Navy is looking at things like the site’s layout and the policies that govern how personnel respond to such attacks.
It also will look at how well the Navy communicated with law enforcement and medical responders, and how survivors and victims were supported during and after the attack.
Hanzlik said any recommended changes could impact similar facilities throughout the Navy.
The attack began at a military recruiting center where 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez fired shots from his car before moving on to the reserve center. He crashed his car through the gates before going into the main building and killing Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith and four Marines: Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan and Lance Cpt. Squire “Skip” Wells. Abdulazeez died at the reserve center in a shootout with police.
Investigators are still looking at Abdulazeez’s motives, but they have said he was a homegrown violent extremist.
The shooting set off a national debate about whether members of the military should be armed on U.S. soil. The site’s commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. Tim White, has said he used a personal firearm to shoot at Abdulazeez as the attacker ran toward the building. Having the gun was likely a policy violantion.
Hanzlik said the Navy’s investigation will consider all the facts relating to the incident, but he declined to comment specifically on the use of personal firearms.
The investigation is being conducted by a 20-person team led by Rear Adm. Frank Morneau. The team’s first report should be finished by the end of September but will go through several reviews.

<http://www.weather.gov/dlh/101026_pressurerecords> dct:description """Here's What We Know About The Pressure Records From October 26, 2010
The low pressure rapidly deepened on October 26, 2010, leading to several pressure records being broken. Here are some facts about those pressure records:
Bigfork, MN (KFOZ) had a minimum sea level pressure of 955.2 millibars (28.21") at 5:13 pm CDT
This is recalculated slightly from the lowest altimeter reading of 28.20" that was initially reported for this storm. Both altimeter readings and sea level pressure are derived from the station pressure. Although the altimeter reading is a sea level reduction as well, it uses a US standard atmosphere assumption. The sea level pressure factors in observed temperatures. Therefore, the altimeter and sea level pressure readings are often very slightly different.
955.2 millibars is now the Minnesota state record for lowest observed sea level pressure
The previous record was 962.7 millibars (28.43"), set on November 10, 1998 at both Albert Lea, MN and Austin, MN.
Superior, WI had a minimum sea level pressure of 961.3 millibars (28.39") at 11:15 am CDT
This is now the Wisconsin state record for lowest observed sea level pressure
The previous record was 963.4 millibars (28.45"), set on April 3, 1982 at Green Bay, WI.
Our two climate reporting sites set low pressure records as well
Duluth, MN had a minimum sea level pressure of 960.2 millibars (28.35") at 11:15 am CDT. This broke the old record at Duluth which was 964.3 millibars (28.48"), set on November 10, 1998. International Falls, MN had a minimum sea level pressure of 956.0 millibars (28.23") at 3:45 pm CDT. This broke the old record which was 971.9 millibars (28.70"), set on October 10, 1949.
Was This Any Kind Of National Record For Lowest Pressure?
The bottom line, is that Bigfork, Minnesota did not set the CONUS record for lowest extratropical sea level pressure. Here are the details:
The lowest sea level pressure recorded at any United States certified observing station was 892 millibars (26.34"), recorded at Matecumbe Key, Florida on September 2, 1935 in the "Labor Day Hurricane". Therefore, the reading at Bigfork on October 26th was not the lowest pressure in the entire United States.
The lowest sea level pressure recorded in a non-tropical (extratropical) storm at any United States certified observing station was 927 millibars (27.35"), recorded at Dutch Harbor, Alaska on October 25, 1977. Therefore, the reading at Bigfork on October 26th was also not the lowest pressure in the entire United States for a non-tropical storm.
Many storms have been discussed as potential record holders for the lowest recorded sea level pressure in a non-tropical storm at a land-based observing station in the Continental United States (CONUS). The lowest that has been mentioned was 951.6 millibars at Bridgehampton, NY on March 3, 1914. However, this value cannot be confirmed by records held at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
The lowest CONUS, land-based, non-tropical, sea level pressure that can be confirmed by NCDC is 955.0 millibars (28.20"). This occurred twice in United States history. The first time was on January 3, 1913 at Canton, NY. The second was on March 7, 1932 at Block Island, Rhode Island. These were verified by NCDC using archived climate data publications.
How Does This Rank Amongst Storms Away From The US Coasts?
If you only consider extratropical lows that tracked between the mountain ranges (Rocky Mountains on the west, Appalachian Mountains on the east) - the Central US - the lowest sea level pressure on record appears to be at Mount Clemens, Michigan at 13Z on January 26, 1978. A 956.0 millibar value was recorded there and is supported by NCDC data. This was related to the same storm that produced a 957.7 millibar sea level pressure at Cleveland, Ohio. The lowest value for the central US is sometimes reported as the reading in Cleveland, however, that was superseded by the value in Mount Clemens.
The January 26, 1978 storm later went on to produce lower sea level pressure readings in Ontario, Canada, including a 955.5 millibar reading at Sarnia. However, these are not in consideration as we are only discussing the United States.
Therefore, the 955.2 millibar value that was recorded in Bigfork, Minnesota on October 26, 2010 appears to be the lowest extratropical sea level pressure on the record books in the mainland United States, excluding the west and east coasts.
What Should I Take Away From This?
The bottom line is that the storm that struck the Upper Mississippi River Valley on October 26-27, 2010 was a very intense and rare storm, something that is not seen in this part of the country very often. While the minimum sea level pressure may not necessarily be the lowest on record, the storm was undoubtedly one of the most intense on record in the continental United States.
In fact, with the storms on January 3, 1913 and March 7, 1932 tied for first place at 955.0 millibars, the October 26, 2010 storm would be the second lowest recorded sea level pressure at 955.2 millibars. NCDC was also able to confirm a 956.3 millibar reading at Eastport, Maine on December 16, 1916.
It is also worth noting that lower pressures have likely been attained off the coast of the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington) or perhaps even just off shore of the New England States (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts). However, given that there are very few reliable observing stations offshore, especially dating back many decades, these low pressures may not have been sampled by our observing network.
Caveats About The Pressure Value At Bigfork
Bigfork (KFOZ) is an AWOS (automated weather observing system) station, which is completely automated. Unlike an ASOS (automated surface observing system), an AWOS does not automatically report a sea level pressure value. Therefore, it was necessary for us to calculate the sea level pressure from the reported station pressure. As we continue to evaluate these calculations, the lowest sea level pressure at Bigfork may fluctuate slightly. However, any slight calibrations in the equation and constants that we are using would not allow the Bigfork reading to break any other records .
Pressure Graphs
Here are a few pressure graphs. The procedure was to evaluate the lowest pressure at each individual time in the day across the Upper Midwest, and then to plot the data on a graph to assess the trends in the minimum pressure at the center of the low. The data was adapted from information provided by Daryl Herzmann.

A jury found Amy Bishop-Anderson guilty of capital murder.
The judge sentenced her to life without parole.
The high profile trial of guilty University of Alabama-Huntsville shooter Amy Bishop-Anderson began on Monday around 10 a.m. in a Madison County courtroom.
Fire marshal, Bobby Rollins, was at the court to make sure the room and hallway wouldn't overcrowd.
Bishop-Anderson shot six people, killing three, on the campus of UAH in 2010.
She pleaded guilty to capital murder and attempted murder on September 11, but state law requires capital murder pleas still go before a jury.
On Monday, Bishop-Anderson entered the courtroom dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit with shackles on her hands and feet.
Judge Alan Mann said before someone can be judged guilty in a capital murder trial, there must be a jury finding.
The death penalty was taken off the table in this case.
Bishop-Anderson was convicted of one count of capital murder in connection with the shooting that took place on the UA-Huntsville campus in 2010.
The three people she killed were Dr. G. K. Podila, the chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences, and two associates, Dr. Maria Ragland Davis and Dr. Adriel Johnson.
The three she injured were Dr. Joseph Leahy, Stephanie Monticello, and Dr. Luis Rogelio Cruz-Vera.

"My main message right now is obviously the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four marines that have been killed. It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion. And although the families are still in the process of being contacted, I want them to know that I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences, and knowing that they have our full support as they try to overcome the grief that's involved here. I also want to say that there are reports of injuries to Chattanooga local law enforcement officials. Thankfully as far as we know at this point, they have survived the assault, and we want to make sure that they know that we're thinking of them they're in our thoughts and prayers.”
- President Barack Obama
“I am heartbroken by the tragic shootings that have taken place today in my hometown. We have been in touch with federal, state and local officials and continue to monitor developments and have offered our assistance. This is a difficult day for Tennesseans and our thoughts and prayers are with all affected by this tragedy.”
- Sen. Bob Corker, who was mayor of Chattanooga from 2001-2005
“Our hearts are broken for the families of the four Marines killed in today's terrible act of violence. They are in our prayers.”
- Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke
“We’ve had a tragedy unfold in Chattanooga today. I know Tennesseans join me in being sickened and saddened by this senseless act.”
- Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam
“Today, the Navy and Marine Corps team collectively mourn the loss of four heroes. The tragedy in Chattanooga is both devastating and senseless. On behalf of the entire Department of the Navy family, I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those killed and wounded in service to our nation during this incident.
Throughout history, our Sailors and Marines have served overseas, in harm's way, and the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps have experienced the deep and lasting pain of combat loss. Today, here at home, we once again feel that pain.
While we expect our Sailors and Marines to go into harm's way, and they do so without hesitation, an attack at home, in our community, is insidious and unfathomable. As the investigation unfolds, our priority will be to take care of the families of those affected.
I'd like to express my gratitude to the first responders on the scene whose prompt reaction was critical to stopping this individual from inflicting further violence.
Though we can never fully prevent attacks like this, we will continue to investigate, review and guard against future vulnerabilities and do everything in our power to safeguard the security of our service members and their families.”

"The Department of Homeland Security is closely monitoring the tragic shooting in Chattanooga, and we are supporting the FBI-led investigation. We caution that, at this time, there are many unconfirmed and possibly false reports about events. Department officials are actively supporting the local response to this incident. The Department is also enhancing the security posture at certain federal facilities, out of an abundance of caution.

<http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2015/06/islamic-state-attacks-foreigners-in-tunisia> dct:description """By Rory McCarthy:
Just two months after the shooting of 22 holidaymakers in the Bardo museum in Tunis, Tunisia has been attacked again. On June 26, two gunmen opened fire and killed at least 38 people on the beaches of Sousse. Most of the victims were foreign tourists – making this both a human tragedy and a profound challenge to Tunisia’s fledgling democracy. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.
This new attack is the worst terrorist incident in the country’s history, and means Tunisia’s vital tourism industry will now be gravely weakened. The once-hopeful democratic transition is also in danger, with growing calls for a tougher security policy.
The attackers opened fire on the beaches of two hotels in Port El Kantaoui, at the northern end of a long coastline of beachfront hotels that runs through the city of Sousse. This area is the most important destination for package holidays in Tunisia.
Tunisia’s tourism minister, Selma Elloumi, called the Sousse attack a “catastrophe” and admitted there was no way to ensure “zero risk”. According to one assessment, revenue from tourism and related industries accounted for up to 14.9% of the Tunisian economy in 2014. Even if the tourist industry had begun to recover four years after the Arab uprisings of 2011, then the Bardo shooting in March 2015 and now the Sousse attacks will surely kick start a long-term crisis.
But despite its record loss of life, the latest attack was not entirely unprecedented.
Escalating violence
Sousse has been targeted before, apparently because it attracts so many tourists. Hotels in Sousse were bombed in 1987, at the height of a clash between the Tunisian regime and the Islamist movement. Then in October 2013 a suicide bomber killed himself on the beach outside a downtown Sousse hotel in a failed terror attack.
Sousse is not just a tourist destination. It has played an important role in the country’s history, producing many of the administrative elite who have run Tunisia since independence in 1956. Former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was himself from Hammam Sousse, a northern suburb close to the scene of the attacks.
The city has a secular middle class, but also significant support for the moderate Islamist movement Ennahdha – I spent a year in the city interviewing Ennahdha activists about the history and evolution of their movement. It also has large, impoverished suburbs filled with Tunisians who have travelled from the poorer towns and villages of the interior in search of work.
As in other poor urban areas in the country, there has been significant Salafist radicalisation here, dating back even to before the 2011 uprising. While these shootings were apparently the work of Islamic State, Tunisia has also been facing an insurgent campaign by supporters of a smaller Tunisian militant group, Uqba ibn Nafi, which is linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. They have been mounting attacks against the military and security forces since late 2012.
Some interesting research suggests there could be a process of “outbidding” underway between al-Qaeda’s proxy force and Islamic State – and indeed, this latest attack suggests the latter is trying to step up its activities inside the country as part of its wider campaign of violence.
Old ways
The decisions the Tunisian government makes in the coming weeks will determine the fate of country’s already fragile transition to democracy. Although the Ben Ali regime was toppled in a popular uprising in January 2011, many of the political and economic interests of the former regime remain intact and the judiciary and security forces remain largely unreformed. The deep state is still at work. There has been a knee-jerk tendency to resort to authoritarian measures in the name of security and stability, and a backslide into the state’s old ways is still a risk.
That much was made clear when, after the attack, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi travelled to Sousse to meet the survivors and promised “painful but necessary” measures would follow. Mohsen Marzouk, an advisor to Essebsi and now the head of his Nidaa Tounes party, which leads the coalition government, called for the creation of new private sector security forces, and said: “We are at war and we must apply the law firmly.”
Already the government has drafted a bill that would jail any Tunisian found to have “denigrated” the armed forces. Human Rights Watch warned that the bill did not meet international human rights standards, and is also concerned about a new law on judicial reform that fails to give the judiciary sufficient independence from the executive.
Other politicians have proposed a national congress to discuss a national strategy to confront the terrorist challenge and popular marches against terrorist violence. But there is still no clear strategy to confront this worsening security crisis and declining economic situation. The damage done to the tourism industry follows waves of workers’ strikes that have also affected the important phosphate mining industry in the south.
There is hope that Tunisia will yet overcome these challenges, just as it has overcome many others since 2011. Politicians have always found a way to negotiate consensus solutions every time a crisis has threatened this hopeful and extraordinary transition to democracy – but that task is becoming ever harder.

<http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/national/BO43150/> dct:description """NEW YORK -- Blowing snow and sleet glazed windshields and roads across the Northeast and the Midwest on Wednesday, messing up Valentine's Day flower deliveries and wrecking couples' plans for romantic dinners.
The storm grounded hundreds of flights and forced the closing of schools and businesses from Kentucky to Maine. Many of those stuck at home had no heat or lights because of blackouts that affected more than a quarter-million customers.
"I'm just trying to figure out where to take my wife for Valentine's Day," said Skip Daniels, the emergency management director in Sussex County, N.J.
At least 13 deaths were blamed on the huge storm system.
Blizzard warnings were posted for parts of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine, where as much as 2 feet of snow was possible.
There were hundreds of accidents. The Ohio State Highway Patrol alone handled more than 1,200, but there were few injuries because most vehicle were moving slowly, Sgt. Brett Gockstetter said.
The storm's cold, snow, sleet and rain made life difficult for Valentine's Day messengers.
"Cold. Slippery. Nobody has their sidewalks sanded," said Caroline Roggero at Rose Petal Florist in Newport, R.I. "They all want their delivery today."
The storm was a convenient excuse for husbands and boyfriends who forgot to send flowers.
Some delivery drivers got stuck on the roads. Flowers delivered to offices were turned away because the businesses were closed. And customers had to change their orders to have flowers delivered to homes instead of places of work.
"We're hoping people will understand we're doing the best we can do," said Pat Jarvis at Dwyer Florist in Northampton, Mass.
The 15,000-member Society of American Florists says Valentine's Day accounts for more than a third of annual sales. Spokeswoman Jennifer Sparks said most florists have four-wheel drive vehicles, and many tried to deliver flowers early.
Americans were predicted to spend $16.9 billion this Feb. 14, according to the National Retail Federation's annual Valentine's Day survey. More than 45 percent of consumers planned an evening out.
Edigio DiPaola, owner of Spennato's Restaurant in Northfield, Ohio, -- a good place for a romantic dinner with its low lighting, intimate tables, lace tablecloths, Italian wine and marinara sauce -- was not expecting much of a Valentine's Day crowd, not with 15 inches of snow on the ground and the temperature in the single digits.
"We are dead," he said, his heavily Italian-accented voice dripping with disappointment. "No one's on the roads. We don't expect anything tonight. It's very bad news -- this was a big day for us. Now it will be way below average."
Vermont's state government ordered all nonessential employees home after noon, the New York Capitol in Albany came to a near-halt, and some Pennsylvania state workers were told to stay home. Maine's governor declared a state of emergency to ensure deliveries of heating oil, and New York's governor activated the National Guard.
In upstate New York, more than a foot of snow had fallen by midday in Herkimer County in the Adirondacks, and up to 3 feet of snow was possible. But the brunt of the storm bypassed towns near the east end of Lake Ontario that had been buried by 10 feet and more of lake-effect snow over the past week.
It was too cold and snowy even to make snow angels. Syracuse school officials had planned to try setting a world record for most snow angels in one place on Thursday, but postponed the effort, citing the weather.
In the Midwest, Springfield, Ill., got 16 inches of snow, and stiff wind piled the snow into drifts as high as 9 feet in parts of Indiana.
Hundreds of flights were canceled Wednesday at the New York City area's three major airports and in Albany, Boston, Washington, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Indianapolis.
About 300,000 customers lost power in Ohio, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Kentucky, Indiana, New York's Long Island and the District of Columbia.
The huge weather system was blamed for three deaths in Nebraska; two each in Indiana, New Jersey and Delaware; and one each in Missouri, Ohio and Virginia. A tornado on the southern side of the huge weather system killed one person in Louisiana.
The storm was good news for the ski industry in New England, where snow has been sparse this winter.
"Best day of the year," snowboarder Willie Bozack, 28, of Moretown, Vt., said outside the base lodge at Sugarbush Resort. "It's epic.\"""" ;

<http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2002/mar/26/storm_toppled_historic/> dct:description """? The branches of the Westport Oak shaded Indians and fur trappers on the nearby Santa Fe Trail, and they supported lynchings in the years before the Civil War. After all that, the tree may have been done in by the ice storm of 2002.
The worst ice storm in the city’s history tore down trees all over eastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri. The casualties included two “Bicentennial Trees,” designated in 1976 because they were believed to be at least 200 years old.
The Westport Oak is a big burr oak, 50 feet tall with an even wider spread of twisting branches. The storm ripped off at least half of its crown and left jagged wounds in its trunk. A huge pile of its branches littered Washington Street last week, just north of busy 43rd Street.
“There’s not money anywhere to do anything about this tree,” said Betty Dawson, a self-professed tree-hugger who discovered the tree in 1976 while working as a nurse at nearby St. Luke’s Hospital.
Then, the tree was surrounded by a rose garden and flowers. Today, the battered Westport Oak stands on a vacant lot. The garden, and the tree’s caregivers, are gone.
“Poor baby,” Dawson recently cooed while cleaning a bronze plaque designating it a bicentennial tree.
Dawson hopes private groups will step forward, trim the tree, care for it and, perhaps, give it a few more years of life.
At least one other bicentennial tree was toppled by the storm a burr oak in Independence, estimated to be 331 years old.
Foresters don’t regularly check on the special trees, so it is uncertain how others have fared. One, estimated to be 355 years old, fell about a year ago in a windstorm, said Don Hamlin, director of campus operations at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in northern Kansas City.
Jerry Monterastelli, an urban forester at the Missouri Department of Conservation, helped select the bicentennial trees in this area. He and other government foresters have been busy with other duties and have not revisited those trees since they were designated in 1976.
“I usually only get notice when they’re damaged,” he said.
George Eib, longtime city forester in Kansas City, checked the Westport tree last week and pronounced its future as iffy, at best. “It’s a shame, but I think it’s going to have to be removed,” Eib said.
If the tree had been cared for in recent years, through trimming and possibly cabling to reinforce its branches, it might have survived the storm, Eib added.""" ;

<http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nwsfo/storage/cases/20000125/> dct:description """Model Error
In general, forecast models preformed very poorly during this event. An example of this is shown in the image below which compares the 48 hour, observed liquid equivalent precipitation with the Eta model 48 hour forecast valid at the same time (click on the image to enlarge, image provided by Michael Brennan, NC State University). The model failed to capture the significant precipitation over the Carolinas and Virginia; in fact the Eta forecast had no precipitation over Raleigh and Richmond where over an inch of liquid equivalent was observed.
As forecasters scrambled to adjust forecasts to reflect the unfolding snowstorm, there was little time to analyze the full reason why the forecast had gone bad. In the wake of the storm, many were left wondering how nearly two feet of snow could have fallen in less than 24 hours with very little warning. Was there something that could have been analyzed ahead of time that would have lead to questioning of model precipitation forecasts? Or was there a physical mechanism that was misunderstood, or missed by the models? Below is a brief summary of some of the forecast errors and research topics that arose from this case.
Incipient Precipitation and Latent Heat
An area of precipitation developed along a frontal system over southern Alabama and southern Mississippi at around 06Z on January 24, 2000. The area of precipitation expanded and intensified as it moved into the cold airmass north of the front in Georgia by 12Z on January 24. Analysis of surface observations and radar imagery show that this area of precipitation was poorly forecast by the Eta model. Research into this storm indicates that this under forecasted area of precipitation that fell into a cold and somewhat dry airmass across the Deep South had a significant impact in how the models handled the developing storm system.
Based on quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory, height rises (falls) occur above (below) a mid-level latent heating maximum, due to changes in the density of the air above and below. This response also creates a low-level maximum in cyclonic potential vorticity (PV), as low-level static stability is increased. The effects of the induced cyclonic PV max are manifest in wave amplification and enhanced rotation around the PV center. The precipitation across the Deep South induced a PV anomaly that enhanced the easterly flow downstream, creating stronger westward moisture advection over the Carolinas from off the Atlantic (Brennan and Lackmann 2005), thereby extending the heavy snowfall further inland. The inability of the models to accurately predict the precipitation across the Deep South was a major reason that the model forecasts of this storm were so inaccurate.
The combination of increased moisture advection, enhanced dynamics, and a deep subfreezing column of air (see GSO soundings below), created an environment that was primed for intense winter weather.""" ;

<https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/alabama-university-shooting-suspect-amy-bishop-violent-past/story?id=9839348> dct:description """Feb. 15, 2010  -- James Anderson, whose wife Amy Bishop has been accused of the killing rampage at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, has a message for his wife: "I love her."
"She's barely holding up," he told ABC affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston today. "Nobody understands what happened. Nobody knew. Sit down and talk to her about what went wrong."
Anderson said he didn't believe his wife -- a brilliant scientist who colleagues said had been upset about not receiving tenure -- was capable of finding out who her alleged victims were for retribution.
And when asked why she might have killed, if she did, he said, "I am not a psychologist.
Meanwhile, Anderson told The Associated Press that he and Bishop went to a shooting range just weeks before the killing, but said the family did not own a gun.
He said he is still baffled about where she may have gotten the gun she is accused of using.
"I feel for all these people," he told ABC. "I wish it had never came to this. She was loved and respected by everyone, students and assistants. All the nursing students liked and loved her."
Bishop, 42, has been arrested and charged in the shooting deaths of three professors and the wounding of three others Friday at a faculty meeting. She could face the death penalty.
Anderson told the Chronicle of Higher Education that his wife had called from jail and said, "I know you guys are obviously in shock," and asked if their four children had done their homework.
Before the shootings, he said, his wife had said nothing and he assumed their Friday "date night" was still on.
But a former colleague of Bishop's has described her as "an oddball."
Sylvia Fluckiger, a lab technician who worked with Bishop at Children's Hospital in Boston, said her colleague was "socially a little awkward," according to the Boston Globe.
Fluckiger and her husband Rudolph worked together at Children's Hospital in the early 1990s where he was a researcher. Bishop helped Rudolph Fluckiger write a research paper as a medical student.
More recently, some of Bishop's students had mostly praise for the biology professor at the University of Alabama. They gave her an overall 3.6 rating out of 5 on RateMyProfessors.com.
She was "absolutely the bomb! Knows her stuff cold, and quick-witted, too."
One commenter said she was "surprised" the Harvard graduate was "not a snob."
"Dr. Bishop is brilliant," another said. "Her research is fascinating. She will surely get the Nobel Prize. She is the best teacher I have ever had."
But another said that, although she graduated from Harvard, "she has very little common sense."
The alleged violent past of the once respected University of Alabama professor accused of the fatal shooting rampage has stunned the families of her victims.
Sherry Foley, 63, who lives in the same Alabama neighborhood as Bishop, was still in shock over her arrest.
"You can't believe that someone you know that lives just down the street can do something like this," she said. "It's like with sex offenders. You never really know what people are and they might be living right next to you."
And news unearthed this weekend that Bishop had shot and killed her 18-year-old brother, Seth Bishop, in 1986, swirled.
Declared accidental at the time, Braintree, Mass., police say they were never comfortable with the ruling.
Investigators also revealed that seven years later, Bishop was the prime suspect in a 1993 mail bombing attempt on a Harvard Medical School professor.
"I just feel angry," LaTasha Davis, stepdaughter of shooting victim Maria Davis -- one of the dead -- told "Good Morning America" today. "How did she even get a job working at the school when she had that type of background?"
She was reportedly upset about being denied tenure at the school. Husband Anderson told the Chronicle of Higher Education that one of her bosses had sent her negative e-mail they called "nastygrams."
When she called him less than an hour after he dropped her off for the faculty meeting Friday, Anderson said, Bishop made no mention of the shootings and told him they were still on for their date night.
LaTasha Davis and her sister, Melissa Davis, told "Good Morning America" they believe Bishop was able to get a list of which professors did not vote in her favor for tenure and used it to plan the shooting.
Also killed, according to the Associated Press were, Gopi K. Podila, the chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences, and faculty member Adriel Johnson.
Melissa Davis said she had taken a class with Bishop and found her to be disorganized and prone to rambling.
"I remember thinking, 'I'm glad I'm not sitting in calculus or anything like that,'" she said.
Melissa Davis said she hopes the shooting will lead to more thorough background checks for its faculty and staff.
"We both loved Maria and believe she never should have been killed like this," she said.
Alabama Shooting Suspect Eyed in 1993 Mail Bombing Attempt
The Davis sisters remembered their stepmother as a calming presence in the house. Maria Davis married their father after the girls' mother died when they were teenagers.
"Maria came in with this gentle kind heart," Melissa said, adding that she never left the house without telling her family that she loved them.
In contrast, Amy Bishop seemed to harbor anger and resentment. Though investigators say they will not re-open the investigation into the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor, those who worked with her at the time say it was terrifying.
"We were completely rattled -- it was the time of the Unabomber," former co-worker Sylvia Fluckiger said of the two homemade pipe bombs that were sent to the professor's house. The bombs were later detonated by the bomb squad.
Once again, Bishop was never charged due to lack of evidence. And, authorities, say the motive seemed to be eerily similar to the potential motive in the Alabama rampage -- Bishop was reportedly upset about a negative evaluation she was expecting to get from the targeted professor.
Fluckiger, who worked with Bishop at a research lab, said she remembered Bishop and the professor having a disagreement.
"I just know there was an argument ... that the police questioned her," Fluckiger said. "She had told me they talked to her about those bombs. She had like a grin on her face."
Investigators said that during the investigation into the bombing, they found a novel on her computer that described a scientist who had shot her brother and then sought redemption.""" ;

A middle school boy allegedly opened fire at an Indiana school Friday morning, police said, leaving a teacher and another student injured, the latest in a string of school shootings this year.
"I heard gunshots and a few screams," a seventh-grader who was across the hall from the shooting told ABC News. "I was scared, I was in shock."
The suspected shooter, a student at Noblesville West Middle School, located about 27 miles north of Indianapolis, asked to be excused from class and then returned to the room armed with two handguns, Noblesville Police Chief Kevin Jowitt said at a news conference.
The teacher and student victims were shot in that room, Jowitt said, adding that the situation was resolved quickly. The suspect, who wasn't injured and wasn't identified, was taken into custody, police said.
One student said he was in class taking a test when the suspect came in with a handgun and started shooting aimlessly, "waiving his hand around," reported ABC affiliate RTV in Indianapolis.
The teacher -- whom multiple students identified as Jason Seaman -- allegedly stopped the shooter, the student told RTV.
The family of Ella Whistler, the student injured in the shooting, released a statement Friday night saying her "status is critical" but she's "stable."
"Our daughter, Ella Whistler, was involved in a horrific shooting today at her school. We will spend the next days and weeks processing what happened and why," the statement reads. "But first, we wanted to say she is doing well at Riley Hospital for Children. Her status is critical, yet we are pleased to report she is stable. We’d like to thank everyone across the country who prayed for our family today. We’ve felt those prayers and appreciate each of them. We’d also like to thank the first responders, Noblesville police, Indiana State Police and the medical staff and surgeons at Riley."
Seaman was struck three times and underwent surgery, according to a Facebook post by his mother.
By Saturday he had been discharged from Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis and was photographed at Noblesville West Middle School shaking hands with U.S. Rep. Susan W. Brooks.
The local politician praised him for his bravery.
“Jason Seaman selflessly put himself in harm’s way to protect his students and it is because of his heroic actions more students were not hurt," she said, according to a release.
Seaman's wife, Colette, provided an initial statement to ABC News from Jason.
"First of all, thank you to the first responders from Noblesville and Fishers for their immediate action and care," the statement from Jason said. "I want to let everyone know that I was injured but am doing great. To all the students, you are all wonderful and I thank you for your support. You are the reason I teach."
Students were forced to shelter in classrooms and barricade doors during the incident.
"I was thinking, 'It's not real, it's not real, everything is going to be OK,'" student Gabbie Manns told ABC News of her time barricaded in the classroom. "We are holding hands holding tight ... people I didn't even know that well came over and held my hand and we all felt really united at that moment."
"There was people crying ... it was really chaos," she added. "I thought about all the other school shootings."
Tanner, an eighth grader, said he was in class when he saw kids running and screaming.
“There was only three of us, we had to barricade the door to make sure no one came in,” he told ABC News.
“I was shaking for my life,” he said, overcome with emotion. “I just didn’t wanna die.”
Kendall, a sixth grader, said she heard an announcement over the intercom, telling students to get in their rooms and barricade the door. She and her classmates got in the corner and the teacher turned off the lights.
“I was really scared, I didn't really know what was going on,” she told ABC News. “My teacher let me use his phone to call my mom.”
"I heard gunshots and a few screams," seventh-grader CJ Livingston, who was in a classroom across from the shooting, told ABC News. "We were all trying to be quiet and there were a lot of people crying around me."
"I was scared, I was in shock. I didn’t really know what to do," he continued. "I just thought I really needed to protect my peers and my friends and if something happened, I was petrified."
He said they threw chairs at the door as a barricade and then lined up behind the desks to hide.
"When I think about how that really must have felt for him I start sobbing," CJ's mother, Kristin Huber, told ABC News. "Something you don’t want your children to ever have to experience."
"When you get a text message from your son saying, 'Mom, there’s an intruder, I just wanted to tell you I love you,' just thinking about him texting me that is pretty tough," she said. "It was devastating. I was grateful when he let me know he was OK."
The school has a full-time school resource officer who was in the building at the time, Jowitt said.
The school does not have metal detectors, officials said.
At the nearby Noblesville East Middle School, "everybody just got so scared" and a lot of people were crying, one sixth-grade girl told RTV.
"It's a surreal feeling," the girl's dad added. "You don't think it's happening in your own town."
"A secondary threat" was also made at Noblesville High School, Jowitt said.
"We have not received any information that this has been anything other than a communicated threat," Jowitt said. "We are securing the high school and taking steps to make sure that it stays secure."
"All this says to me is insanity has hit Indiana," one man whose wife's grandson attends school in the district told RTV.
The man, who described the shooting as "chaos," said the boy texted his mother, "come get me."
Vice President Mike Pence, an Indiana native, said he is "praying for the victims."
“To everyone in the Noblesville community -- you are on our hearts and in our prayers,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thanks for the swift response by Hoosier law enforcement and first responders.”
Gov. Eric Holcomb said he was monitoring the shooting.
"Our thoughts are with all those affected by this horrible situation,” Holcomb said.
Friday morning's shooting comes one week after a teenage boy allegedly stormed his Texas high school, shooting and killing 10 and wounding 13 others.

 -- The FBI has revealed new details about the shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee last week that killed five U.S. service members.
FBI Special Agent Edward Reinhold, who is leading the investigation, gave a more detailed timeline of the shooting, which he said happened in less than three to five minutes and is currently being investigated by 700 to 1,000 FBI agents assigned to the case, including 250 personnel on the ground in Chattanooga.
Reinhold confirmed that Chattanooga police had been in car pursuit of the alleged gunman, Mohamad Abdulazeez, after he first fired shots from his vehicle at an armed forces recruitment center. Abdulazeez then drove to a Naval Operational Support Center building, where he went on a shooting spree before a police officer shot and killed him after he emerged from the back of the building, authorities said.
Reinhold added that only three weapons -- all belonging to Abdulazeez -- were recovered at the Naval Reserve, saying that two weapons -- an assault rifle and handgun -- were on the shooter and that an additional weapon was in his vehicle. None of the weapons were modified, he added.
Two other guns at the scene belonged to service members, authorities said.
When asked if any friendly fire took place during the shooting, Reinhold said preliminary ballistic reports indicated that all the victims were killed with the same weapon owned by Abdulazeez.
The FBI is considering Abdulazeez a “homegrown, violent, and extremist” who acted on his own, though they are investigating all possible leads and every relative and associate he has, including an uncle in Jordan, Reinhold said.""" ;

 -- The proximity of two different military offices and the mystery surrounding a lone gunman caused confusion as local and federal authorities tried to respond to a fatal attack in Chattanooga.
Now investigators have been able to outline how the attack on Thursday unfolded and left four Marines dead and three other people injured. The shooter also died.
Here is the deadly sequence of events.
10:45 a.m. Thursday
The first shooting was reported at the Combined Armed Forces Recruiting Center on Lee Highway.
The shooter reportedly took aim while still in his silver Ford Mustang convertible with the top down.
One Marine was reportedly wounded in this shooting. The individual has not yet been publicly identified.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Ed Reinhold said the suspect, who officials later identified as Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, then drove for "probably five minutes" to a second shooting site.
Reinhold said that the Chattanooga Police Department "started a pursuit," at this point.
11 a.m. Thursday
The second shooting scene was the Naval Operational Support Center and Marine Reserve Center on Amnicola Highway. The complex contains facilities for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve, including their armory.
Abdulazeez ran his car through a security gate, entered the building and killed four Marines, officials said.
A witness who works nearby, Marilyn Hutcheson, told The Associated Press that she heard many shots.
"I couldn't even begin to tell you how many," she said, according to the wire service. "It was rapid-fire, like pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, so quickly. The next thing I knew, there were police cars coming from every direction."
The suspect died at the scene amid a firefight with police in which he was wounded multiple times, according to a U.S. official. One Chattanooga police officer was wounded. Local police said this afternoon that Abdulazeez hit one officer with gunfire and fellow officers "pulled him to safety while continuing to return fire."
“All indications are that he was killed by fire from the Chattanooga police officers,” Reinhold said today. "We have no indication that there was any self-inflicted wounds. However, we will examine that to make sure that's the case."
Also injured was a sailor, who was wounded at the Marine Reserve Center, and a Marine recruiter, who was treated and released.
A defense official said the sailor was in critical condition. The condition of the officer was not clear.
Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said that a local police officer was shot in the ankle at the second scene.
Reinhold confirmed Thursday that the shootings "ended within 30 minutes" of when they started.""" ;

 -- The gunman who opened fire inside a movie theater in Louisiana Thursday night allegedly threatened his family and was involuntarily committed to a hospital in Georgia seven years ago, according to documents filed in court.
Shooter John Houser, whom police described as a drifter “who was intent on shooting and escaping," died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being cornered, authorities said. He was among three people who died at the Grand 16 Theatre in Lafayette, police said. Nine others were injured, one in critical condition, police said.
Houser, 59, was estranged from his family, police said, adding that authorities spoke to some of them overnight.
Houser and his wife were married and lived together from 1983 to 2012, according to court filings obtained by ABC News. The couple separated in December 2012, and she then filed for divorce in March 2015, the documents show. The divorce is not yet final.
A photo of John Houser, who shot several people in a Lafayette movie theater on July 23, 2015, is shown during a press conference, July 24, 2015. ABC News
They have adult children together, according to the court filings.
In April 2008, Houser's family members filed a temporary protective order against him in Georgia, according to court filings.
The family members claimed that Houser didn't want his daughter getting married and he exhibited “extreme erratic behavior" and "made ominous as well as disturbing statements" that the marriage wouldn't occur, according to documents. Houser's wife allegedly "became so worried about the Defendant’s volatile mental state that she has removed all guns and/or weapons from their marital residence," according to documents.
Houser also allegedly threatened his wife's aunt, the documents said.
Houser was involuntarily committed to a hospital in Georgia, the documents said, and he allegedly threatened his wife that once he got out he would continue his erratic behavior and stop the marriage. He also allegedly harassed his daughter's future in-laws, the documents said.

Houser's wife said he had a history of mental illness, including manic depression and bi-polar behavior, according to court filings. She said Houser took medication daily, but sometimes forgot to take it or would forget to eat, which affected his behavior, according to court filings.
The protection order was lifted May 8, 2009, the documents said.
Houser applied for a pistol permit in Alabama in 2006, Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said today. But the permit was denied because he had been arrested in connection to an arson case in Georgia in 1989 or 1990, and there was a report of domestic violence against him in 2005, the sheriff said.
A 2005 domestic violence complaint against Houser was filed with the police in Alabama, Taylor said, but it was never prosecuted.
Police said Houser had likely been in Lafayette since early this month, staying at a motel.
Wigs and glasses were found in Houser's car -- a 1995 blue Lincoln Continental -- and motel room, according to police.
One weapon, a .40-caliber handgun, was recovered, police said. At least 13 rounds were shot, according to police.
Separately, Houser was described in a report today by a legal advocacy group as someone who was “caught up with a number of far-right ideas and fascinated about ‘the power of the lone wolf.’”
He wrote dozens of comments on Internet message boards, expressing “interest in white power groups, anti-Semitic ideas, the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.
“Do not mistake yourselves for one minute, the enemy sees all posted on this website. I do not want to discourage the last hope for the best, but you must realize the power of the lone wolf, is the power that come forth in ALL situations,” Houser wrote on a forum dedicated to the New York chapter of Golden Dawn, Greece’s far-right neo-Nazi political party, according to SPLC. “Look within yourselves.”
He also cited minimal political involvement and “hustling” among his interests, the law center wrote.
Houser has referenced Adolf Hitler many times online, saying, for instance, “Hitler is loved for the results of his pragmatism,” last January on another website, SPLC said.
But police emphasized that there is no known motive for the shooting.
Houser's estranged wife, Kellie Houser, said in a statement through her divorce lawyer: "At this time the family has no comment. Our concern and our prayers are for the families of those who lost their lives or were wounded in LaFayette, LA. Please allow our family some privacy at this time."

At least three tornadoes struck the city of Springfield, Mass., alone, with a fourth unconfirmed twister possibly touching down in the city, Mayor Dominic J. Sarno said. Many of those storms also blasted the areas surrounding the city of more than 150,000 residents 90 miles west of Boston.
The Massachusetts twisters hit as unstable weather threatened the entire Northeast, bringing tornado watches to Philadelphia, New York and Boston.
The situation in Massachusetts was so bad that Gov. Deval Patrick declared a statewide state of emergency, calling up 1,000 members of the National Guard.
Two of the four fatalities in Massachusetts occurred in West Springfield, and there was one each in Springfield and Brimfield, a state official said, correcting earlier official statements.
Sources also disagreed on the number and location of confirmed tornado touch-downs in the state.
Patrick said early Wednesday evening that at least 19 Massachusetts communities were affected by rough weather and an unspecified number of twisters.
"Motorists should be off the roads," Patrick said. "There are downed limbs, downed wires."
Tens of thousands of the state's residents were without power, officials said.
Springfield officials were doing house-to-house checks on residents. Local and state officials hoped to do a fuller damage assessment on the affected regions in the morning daylight.
"With 19 communities affected, I can't imagine, given what we're hearing about some of the reports of damage, that there will not be federal assistance," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
Springfield-Area Tornado Damage: 'Like King Kong Took a Walk'
Video and still photos of apparent tornadoes hitting Springfield and elsewhere in Massachusetts showed funnel clouds, swirling winds and debris flying through the air.
Even after the twisters passed, cameras on buildings trained on the western part of Springfield showed broken trees, roof damage and overturned trucks. Roads were impassable in the hardest-hit areas and some people were stuck in their cars because of downed trees and power lines.
Skip Hynd described the scene just across the Connecticut River on Main Street in West Springfield, Mass.
"It looked like King Kong took a walk through there," he said. "Every side street is just about impassable."
Baystate Medical Center in Springfield was treating numerous injured people, some with serious force trauma injuries, spokeswoman Jane Albert told The Associated Press.
Late Wednesday evening, Springfield Mayor Sarno said the number of people hospitalized for weather-related causes in the city stood beyond 40.
At least 250 people were being sheltered overnight at the MassMutual Center arena in the city, Patrick said.
As those displaced residents assembled at the arena, they contrasted with teens in tuxedoes and dresses attending a high school prom upstairs at the same arena.
But the revelry of the prom for Minnechaug Regional High School of Wilbraham, Mass., did not reflect the fear many in the area felt hours earlier.
Betsy Hogan was on Memorial Bridge between Springfield and West Springfield when tornadoes began rolling through around 4:35 p.m.
"I was at the halfway mark on the bridge and the tractor trailer in front of me flipped right over," she told ABC News Springfield, Mass., affiliate WGGB. "I'm still shaking. ... Once that tractor trailer went I thought I was going to go too.
"Trees were down all over the place on Memorial and windows were blown out," she added.
Cassie Moore also was stuck on the bridge and sheltered the driver of the overturned truck in her compact car.
"It was the most frightening thing of my life," she told WGGB of the experience.
"The truck just started shaking and blew right over on its side," Moore said. "My little ... Honda Civic was just shaking and shaking and I thought, 'If this truck is going to be blown over, I'm going to go in the river.'"
Both she and the truck driver survived without major injuries, she said.
Louis Vega hustled diners to the center of the restaurant where he works in Springfield just as the storm blew in.
"No sooner than I ran back in the restaurant and warned everybody the tornado was coming it just hit like that," he said. "Windows started breaking, trees started coming down, roofs started coming off and it's pretty scary."
In Westfield, Mass., downed trees marked the twister's path.
"There's a lot of trees down in Westfield," said Jim Wiggs of Westfield Emergency Management. "We do have a missing part of the roof of a school. There's property damage up in the eastern part of the city. There's some property damage. We're still receiving some reports of trees falling on houses and power lines down throughout the city. It's an absolute, its a mess."
There have been an average of two tornadoes per year in Massachusetts since 1950, though none since 2008, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The last fatalities from a tornado in the state were in 1995, when three died and 24 were injured by an EF4 tornado.

March 11, 2009 -- At least 11 people were shot dead Tuesday afternoon in southern Alabama by a lone gunman, according to the FBI.
The suspect, identified early Wednesday morning as Michael McLendon of Kinston, Ala., took his own life after leaving a trail of bloodshed across two towns.
Jim Stromenger of the Samson, Ala., Police Department said the shootings occurred in at least four separate locations in two towns. No motive is known at this time, he said.
Coffee County coroner Robert Preachers told The Associated Press that the suspect started his spree by burning down his mother's house, where officials found her body. Preachers confirmed that Lisa McLendon had been shot, along with the family dogs.
By late afternoon the shooter had moved on to Samson, where he went to a private home and killed at least five people -- four adults and a child.
Among the dead were the suspect's grandparents, aunt and uncle, confirmed Preachers.
McLendon went on to kill two more people in two separate houses.
"He was just driving down the street shooting at people sitting on their porches," State Sen. Harri Anne Smith, R-Slocomb, told the Dothan Eagle newspaper. "A family was just sitting on the porch and they were shot."
Geneva County coroner Max Motley said he was called to the Big Little Store on West Main Street in Samson, where he found the body of a woman between the gas pump and the front door, the Eagle's Web site reported. She was found face up with at least one fatal gunshot wound.
Samson contractor Greg McCullough said he was pumping gas at the station when the gunman opened fire, wounding him in the shoulder and arm with bullet fragments that struck his truck and the pump.
"I first thought it was somebody playing," he said, explaining that the gunman roared into the parking lot and slammed on his brakes. Then he saw the rifle. He said the gunman fired and the rifle appeared to jam, then he "went back to firing." Then he drove off, according to the AP.
After he fired at a state trooper, police pursued the shooter to Reliable Metal Products, where he fired an estimated 30 rounds. One of the bullets hit the Geneva police chief, who was saved by his bulletproof vest, the Alabama Safety Department said in a statement.
The gunman then went into the plant and shot himself, the AP reported.
The gunman had worked at Reliable Metal, said State Rep. Warren Beck, a Republican whose district includes Geneva.
"My secretary heard gunfire everywhere," he said. "This is one of the most tragic events ever in Geneva County."
State Sen. Harri Anne Smith, R-Slocomb, told the AP some of those killed in Samson were sitting outside.
"He was just driving down the street shooting at people sitting on their porches," she said. "A family was just sitting on the porch, and they were shot."
Reliable Metal Products makes grills and vents for heating and AC systems, mainly for hotels. A call to a person who answered the phone at the plant said no one could talk about the shooting, according to the AP.
The towns of Geneva and Samson are roughly 30 miles south of Fort Rucker, near the Florida border in southeast Alabama. Geneva's population is about 4,400 and Samson's, 2,000.
Geneva County deputies rammed the suspect's Mitsubishi Eclipse in front of Alabama Title Loans on Highway 52, near Wal-Mart, according to the Eagle.

<https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3983346> dct:description "A massive storm is bringing yet more ice to the Midwest today, leaving schools and airports closed and hundreds of thousands without power. At least 22 deaths, most of them in traffic accidents, are being blamed on the storm Officials in Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma have declared states of emergency. And President Bush declared an emergency in Oklahoma on Tuesday, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. Heavy ice and falling branches have been snapping power lines across the region. More than half a million homes and business in Oklahoma are without power and most school districts in the state remain closed for a second day. A power company spokesman says it could be 10 days before they are able to restore power to everyone. Utility companies in Missouri, Kansas and Iowa are also reporting tens of thousands of customers without power. In Iowa, Des Moines' airport was closed yesterday and a spokesman says it could stay that way, with crews unable to keep up with the ice and freezing rain. That's putting a crimp in presidential campaigning, with Republican Mike Huckabee and former President Bill Clinton canceling appearances today. Iowa's largest school district closed for the day in Des Moines, telling its nearly 31,000 students to stay home, and kids across most of Oklahoma and in the Kansas City, Mo., area stayed home for a second day. Schools also were closed in parts of Wisconsin, including Milwaukee Public Schools with 85,000 students. \"We thought about our kids on foot,\" said Milwaukee schools spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin. Some drivers couldn't even get to their buses, she said. About an inch of ice was expected Tuesday over parts of Iowa, followed by up to 5 inches of sleet and snow. \"It's a pretty good ice-maker,\" said Frank Boksa, a National Weather Service forecaster. Ice as much as an inch thick had accumulated on trees, power lines, streets and car windshields Monday in parts of Oklahoma and Missouri, with thinner layers elsewhere. Nearly 600,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses still had no electricity Tuesday, most of them since Monday when power lines began snapping under the weight of ice and falling branches - the biggest power outage in state history. Utilities in Missouri reported more than 100,000 homes and business without power and Kansas utilities said probably more than 70,000 were blacked out Tuesday, with some in the dark since Sunday. \"This is a big one. We've got a massive situation here and it's probably going to be a week to 10 days before we get power on to everybody,\" said Ed Bettinger, a spokesman for Public Service Company of Oklahoma. \"It looks like a war zone.\" Iowa's two major utilities reported over 17,000 customers without power Tuesday. Many travelers also were grounded at Chicago, where about 250 flights were canceled Tuesday morning at O'Hare International Airport and departure delays averaging 15 to 30 minutes, said Karen Pride of the city's Department of Aviation. Kansas City International Airport in Missouri canceled more than 90 flights Tuesday morning, but spokesman Joe McBride said that was probably due to problems at other airports. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers sent 50 generators and three truckloads of bottled water from Texas to distribute to blacked-out areas of Oklahoma. At least 22 deaths - most of them in traffic accidents - had been blamed on the ice and cold since the weekend, including 15 in Oklahoma, four in Kansas, and three in Missouri." ;

<https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/04/fort-hood-shooter-had-lengthy-but-unremarkable-military-career/> dct:description """(Facebook)
The Army service record of Spc. Ivan A. Lopez, who has been identified as the shooter who killed three fellow soldiers and injured 16 others at Fort Hood, Texas, on Wednesday, revealed a lengthy though unremarkable military career.

Photos: Shooting at Fort Hood
Lopez, a native of Guayanilla, P.R., was an active duty soldier who initially began his Army career as a member of the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1999. He did not complete training and was discharged in November 1999, according to M aj. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Puerto Rico National Guard.
Lopez re-entered the Guard in 2003 as an infantryman, though he later transitioned to a Guard band, where he played percussion.

Related: Everything We Know About the Suspected Shooter
By 2007, he was once again an infantryman and deployed with the Guard for a yearlong deployment to the Sinai Peninsula as part of the Multi-National Observer Force that safeguards the Camp David Accords.
In an interview with ABC News, Lopez's supervisor during that deployment, Command Sgt. Maj. Nelson Bigas, had nothing but praise for his service, describing him as a soldier who was "outstanding" and "disciplined."
His service record shows that Lopez entered the active duty Army in April 2010 and joined the 4 th Brigade, 1 st Armored Division as an infantryman.
He deployed with the rest of his unit to Iraq from August to December 2011. Originally slated for a 12-month deployment, the unit's stay was shortened to four months after the Obama administration could not reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to keep troops there past 2011. That meant that all American military units would have to leave the country by year's end.
Lopez returned with the brigade to the unit's home base at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.
By February 2014, Lopez had left Fort Bliss to join the 49 th Movement Control Battalion after he changed his military job to become a truck driver. That battalion's building was one of the locations for Wednesday's shootings.
During his lengthy military career, Lopez received military awards consistent with his deployments and length of service.
They included twice receiving the Army Commendation Medal, four Army Achievement Medals, three Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service Medals, the Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign star, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with M Device, and two awards of the Multinational Force and Observers Medal.

<https://albarrieprocesscontrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/1985-barrie-tornado/> dct:description """Around this time of year people in Barrie, Ontario often ask one another “Where were you when the tornado hit?” It brings back some amazing stories of survival as well as memories of devastation and loss.
As May 31st will be the 25th anniversary, it would be fitting to reflect on what happened that day. In total there were 13 separate tornadoes, including 2 killer ones (F4 on the Fujita scale) crossing into Southern Ontario from the U.S.A. One of the F4 tornadoes came through Barrie killing 8 people including a young man who worked across the street at a neighboring business found in the plant rubble of Albarrie. There were an additional 155 people injured as well 300 homes destroyed and at least 16 factories including Albarrie.
What I remember on that Friday afternoon was the very unusual hue of the sky. It was a distinctive yellow-green that I have never seen before or since. I do not recall any warnings on the news or weather channels. Communications and early warning systems have advanced significantly in 25 years. Sometime between 3:30PM and 4:00 PM the power went out, but we weren’t sure why. It was later learned that major transformers were hit by tornadoes Southwest of the city.
There was no scheduled evening shift. As the afternoon shift was over for the day, it was decided to send the office staff home early. When I left the building around 4 PM, there were only a couple of employees left closing up. The power going out in advance of the tornado hitting Albarrie was a blessing which saved our staff as well as many other lives.
That evening my husband and I and our infant daughter drove to the Kawarthas to visit relatives. There were a couple of things that stood out that evening which didn’t make sense. First, when we stopped at the bank before leaving Barrie; there were people talking about homes being ripped apart and missing walls and roofs in an area just across from the bank and Lake Simcoe. At the time we actually thought these people had had too much to drink. And during the trip we saw pieces of pink insulation scattered everywhere as well as assorted debris.
Later when we saw the evening news, there was unbelievable footage of Albarrie totally destroyed. It looked similar to war pictures with piles of rubble, twisted metal and broken machinery. I remember anxiously calling my boss to find out what had happened to the employees who had locked up. He assured me everyone from Albarrie had made it out safely. One employee had actually driven home in the tornado and saw cars flying around in the air. When she pulled her car over to the side of the road, she said it sounded like an army was pounding on it with baseball bats.
25 years later I feel fortunate to be here to have these memories as well as happy that Albarrie has rebuilt and prospered.
– S. Johnson

Despite its appeal as a natural harbor, Galveston, Texas, is located on a small Gulf Coast barrier island that makes it ill-suited for dense urban development. Early American and European settlers envisioned Galveston harbor as a place with tremendous economic potential, appropriate for urban expansion. In Mythic Galveston: Reinventing America's Third Coast, Susan Wiley Hardwick examines Galveston's rapid rise and the myth created by immigrants and boosters to promote the vision of an abundant island with a highly temperate, even tropical, climate, ideal for settlement. Hardwick's historical analysis focuses on immigrant settlement patterns and the important contributions to Galveston's evolving sense of place made by diverse ethnic and racial groups

<https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/jury-finds-n-b-shooter-matthew-raymond-not-criminally-responsible-for-four-killings-1.5197334> dct:description """FREDERICTON -- The Fredericton man who shot four people, including two police officers, while in the grip of delusions about demons and a pending apocalypse has been found not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder.
The jury delivered its verdict on the fourth day of deliberations following a nine-week trial that explored the dimensions of mental illness and the need for justice in a tragedy that devastated families and shook a community to its core.
Relatives of the victims hugged each other and sobbed in court after the verdict was announced on Friday. Matthew Raymond, who admitted to the killings, bowed his head and wiped away tears but said nothing.
Outside the court, Jackie McLean, widow of Fredericton police constable Robb Costello, who died in the shooting, said the verdict was not unexpected. But she said it's a bitter pill to swallow.
"Obviously the mental health system failed the Raymond family in the first place, and now I feel as though the criminal justice system has failed us," said McLean, who was wearing blue to honour the fallen police officers.
Nathan Gorham, lead defence lawyer for Raymond, said his client is "grief-stricken" by the enormity of his crime. But Gorham said the verdict was the right one considering that Raymond was "very, very ill and was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of what he was doing."
"Personally I would prefer if we could advance to a less adversarial system, once a person acknowledges they have done the crime and where people don't feel there are winners or losers at the end," Gorham said. "The fact is, Mr. Raymond will remain in custody unless the process decides at some point in time, which could be far off in the future, that he is no longer a threat to the public."
Raymond, 50, will be held in a psychiatric hospital in northern New Brunswick. There will be a disposition hearing next month in court at which time family members can give victim impact statements. There will also be a hearing to have Raymond declared high risk.
The trial revived memories of a difficult time in the New Brunswick capital, a city known for its quiet, tree-lined streets and low crime rate.
The four victims left behind many grieving relatives, and the Aug. 10, 2018 shootings shocked the city. "Our hearts are broken," Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien said at the time of the tragedy. "We grieve as one."
The shooting is one of three mass killing events that have shaken the normally tranquil Maritimes. In 2014, a shooter in Moncton, N.B., killed three RCMP officers and injured two. Then in April of this year, a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 22 people and injured three -- the deadliest such rampage in Canadian history.
In addition to Costello, 45, who had four children, the other Fredericton police constable who died was Sara Burns, 43, a wife with three children. They were the first officers to arrive at the scene of the early morning shooting and were shot as they rushed to help two people lying on the ground.
The two on the ground likely were dead when the officers arrived. Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, whose nickname was Bubbles, and Donnie Robichaud, 42, were shot as they packed their car in the parking lot of the apartment complex. A relative said they were going to go zip-lining after work. The two had just recently started dating.
Autopsies of the victims presented at trial show all four victims were shot at least once in the head. Some were shot multiple times in the body as well as in the head.
Police officers testified that the shots came from the window of Raymond's third-floor apartment that was part of the four-building housing complex. They described how Raymond was shot in the abdomen by police before officers stormed the apartment and arrested him.
Raymond has fully recovered from the injury.
Police said they seized a semi-automatic SKS rifle, a shotgun, about 2,000 of rounds of ammunition and a knife from Raymond's apartment. They also found 22 spent casings and seven spent shotgun shells in two different rooms.
There was never any doubt that Raymond was the shooter. The key question for the jury revolved around his mental disorder and whether it rendered him not criminally responsible.
During the trial, evidence taken from Raymond's computer and other material found in his apartment revealed his deepening involvement with conspiracy theories, hoaxes, religious beliefs about end times and numerology. From 2017 until the shooting in 2018, his mental deterioration was marked by bizarre beliefs about demons masquerading as political leaders and celebrities, about the earth being flat and about a coming apocalypse.
Two psychiatrists who testified told the jury that Raymond had a mental disorder -- one said it was schizophrenia and the other said it was a delusional disorder.
"Matthew Raymond was suffering from a disease of the mind at the time he committed these acts," Justice Larry Landry said in his charge to the jury.
The defence argued the mental disorder rendered Raymond incapable of understanding the nature of his actions. But Crown prosecutors said the delusions he was suffering from waxed and waned and were not intense enough to prevent him from understanding that he was shooting humans, and that it was wrong.
Fredericton police Chief Roger Brown said Friday his thoughts were with the families of the victims and of the accused, as well as with the entire police force.
"I thank the jury for their time and deliberations and am fully aware that no one has emerged from this situation unscarred," he said in a news release. "It is important that we respect the decision that has been passed down as we move forward."
The province said the trial's jury was the first to be selected in Canada since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The trial was held in a downtown convention centre with the seats widely spaced. Only media and family members of the victims were allowed to watch the proceedings.

Author: Thomas Jones Pierce
Younger son of Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Tewdwr by Gwenllian, daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan. He was only 4 years old when his father died and leadership of the revolt against Norman rule in South Wales passed to his half-brothers — Anarawd and Cadell. As a youth of 13 he appears with his elder brother, Maredudd, fighting under Cadell's direction in 1146. The next ten years saw the old kingdom of Deheubarth reconstituted with the expulsion of the Clare s from Ceredigion and the Clifford s from Cantref Bychan and Llandovery, and to this dominion Rhys succeeded as sole ruler in 1155 on the death of Maredudd, Cadell having been permanently incapacitated four years earlier. He assumed the mantle of the old kings of Deheubarth at a moment when the political situation in England had been transformed by the accession of Henry II, and this proved the dominant factor in Rhys's career throughout the next three decades. After some show of truculence he submitted to Henry in 1158, was deprived of Ceredigion and a large part of Ystrad Tywi, and was obliged to acknowledge the overlordship of the Crown over the ancestral territory in Cantref Mawr. The act of homage, it would appear, was accompanied by an agreement whereby Rhys finally dropped the title of king, for henceforth he is always referred to in the chronicles as ' the lord Rhys ' — see Owain Gwynedd and Madog ap Maredudd.
For the next seven years intermittent revolts and truces reveal his restlessness and suppressed ambitions which once again found an outlet in the great rising of 1164-5 when, Henry being preoccupied at home, Rhys seized Ceredigion and Emlyn (including the fortresses of Cardigan and Kilgerran) and very soon re-established himself in the position from which he had been ousted in 1158. For the remainder of his life he was able to maintain unquestioned control of these territories, and, indeed, to add to them portions of Dyfed : that he was able to do so was due to a combination of favourable circumstances. There was little to fear from Powys or Gwynedd after 1170 in which year Owain Gwynedd died; at about the same time troublesome elements among the Norman settlers of Dyfed withdrew to take part in the Irish Conquest, a development which so alarmed Henry, whose prestige following Beckett's murder had fallen very low, that he sought Rhys's friendship. Confirmed in his tenure of Deheubarth, created justice of South Wales, and recognized as the leading native magnate of the time, Rhys laid aside all pretensions to the regal status of his ancestors, contented himself with the reality of power, co-operated loyally with Henry, and proceeded to set the fashion among Welsh rulers of adopting Norman ways in dress and domestic manners, as well as in matters of State. At Dinefwr, the ancient capital, a castle in the new style was begun, and at Cardigan there appeared another fortress of the same kind in which the renowned 'eisteddfod' of 1176 was held under his auspices. He lent his patronage to the new religious orders of the time, showing his concern for the spiritual welfare of his people : Whitland enjoyed his protection, Strata Florida was virtually his creation, and Talley was his special and unique foundation.
His last years were darkened by the animosities of his sons, and by the indifference of the new administration under Richard I to the special position which he had hitherto held. Believing attack to be the surest means of defence, the old warrior resumed hostilities against his Norman neighbours, which continued to the end of his life. He died on 28 April 1197 and was buried in the cathedral church of S. Davids. He had married Gwenllian, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, by whom he had eight sons (see Gruffydd ap Rhys, Rhys Gryg, Maelgwn) and a daughter, Gwenllian, who married Ednyfed Fychan.

<https://blog.weatherstem.com/great-blizzard-of-1899/> dct:description """During the second week of February of 1899, a good portion of the United States was affected with snow and frigid air. This event became known as the Great Blizzard of 1899 or the Great Arctic Outbreak of 1899.
A series of multiple storms within the first week of the month left a very deep snow pack over most of the Great Plains and Midwest, which kept the cold air from warming up as it moved out of Canada and toward the southern states. On the 11th, a low pressure system formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved across the Florida Peninsula on the 12th, and finally raced up the East Coast on the 13th and 14th.
Near blizzard-like conditions (snow accompanied with high winds) were seen in southern cities along the Gulf Coast, such as New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola. The furthest southerly report of snow came from Fort Myers, FL and Tampa, FL had its first measurable snowfall recorded. From the Carolinas to Maine, snow totals in excess of a foot were reported. Over 34” of snow fell in Washington D.C., and in Cape May, NJ, a coastal town in the southern part of NJ which rarely sees significant snowfall totals, almost 3’ of snow was recorded during the 4-day event.
In addition to the snow, a bitterly cold air mass moved in behind the storm and many all-time minimum temperature records were set during this event. Milligan, OH reported a minimum temperature of -39˚F on the morning of the 10th. The low temperature on the 11th reached -15˚F in Washington DC, -22˚F in Wichita, KS and -39˚F in Rapid City, SD. The morning of the 12th, many stations in the southern tier of the country reported temperatures below 20˚F, including stations in south Texas and along the Gulf of Mexico. On the 12th, Galveston, TX recorded a low of 8˚F, 2˚F was recorded in Baton Rouge, LA and 7˚F in New Orleans. The temperature dropped to -2˚F in Tallahassee, FL on the same morning, and this only time in recorded history that sub-zero temperature has been observed and this record still hold for the state. Reports of ice floes floating out of the mouth of the Mississippi River and that the port of New Orleans was completely iced over. There were also reports of frost in Cuba that damaged a variety of crops in the country.
This event was one of the coldest ever recorded in the Southeast United States, and the only other cold wave that has been seen with a similar severity was the event that took place in January 1985. Many of the cold temperature records that were set during the 1899 event were replaced by those recorded during the January 1985 event.
This storm is unique in that it caused significant snow accumulations with bitterly cold temperatures. While winter storms are commonly referred to as being the ‘worst’ or ‘coldest,’ the Great Blizzard of 1899 remains a benchmark for many forecasters.""" ;

<https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/2020-09-24/> dct:description """Analysis
Presidential Race: With Election Day just six weeks away, Joe Biden is positioned to win in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Among likely voters, Biden leads President Donald Trump by 5 points, 48%-43%. Another 2% support another candidate, and 7% remain undecided. These results resemble the gap between Hillary Clinton and Trump in 2016, when Clinton won the state with nearly 50% of the vote to Trump’s 44%.
The gap between Biden and Trumps expands to 8% when looking at the most likely voters. Among the most enthusiastic voters, Biden is ahead of Trump 51% to 43%. These results demonstrate Virginia’s continued shift toward Democratic candidates statewide, which has been ongoing since the 2008 presidential election.
Biden’s lead is built on a 6-point enthusiasm advantage that Democratic voters have over Republican voters and a 27% advantage among women, where Biden holds a 61% to 34% lead. Further breaking down the most enthusiastic likely voters, Biden holds Trump to a draw among voters 45 and older, a bloc Trump has done well among in the past. Biden also has big advantages among younger voters (56%-38%), Black voters (75%-14%), and college-educated voters (66%-30%). Trump’s advantage is among non-college-educated voters (54%-37%), where he has a 17-point advantage over Biden, and among white voters (53%-43%) and men (52%-40%).
U.S. Senate: Democrat Mark Warner has a sizeable lead over his Republican challenger Daniel Gade among both likely voters (52% to 39%) and very likely voters (52% to 41%). This differs from the more tightly contested race in 2014, when Warner defeated Republican Ed Gillespie by just over 1%. Warner’s lead over Gade is built on strong support among the traditional Democratic coalition of women, Black voters, younger voters, and college- educated voters, but Warner also leads among independents and voters 45 and older. Gade has a slight lead among men and white voters and a significant lead among non-college-educated voters.
Constitutional Amendment: Virginia voters appear poised to pass the state constitutional amendment that would change how redistricting is done, with support at 48% and opposition at 28% (24% are undecided). Support is strong among Democratic voters, Black voters, and college-educated voters. Republican voters oppose the amendment and independents are largely split on the question. “Considering that the Democratic Party of Virginia opposes this amendment, there seems to be a real disconnect with voters at the grassroots about reforming the way legislative districts are drawn,” said Wason Center Research Director Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo.
State of things: Virginia voters assess both the state of the country and the state of the Commonwealth negatively, with 76% saying the country is headed in the wrong direction (only 16% say right direction) and 47% saying Virginia is headed in the wrong direction (43% say right direction). Assessments of both the country and the Commonwealth have worsened compared to recent years. Approval of President Trump’s job performance stands at 40%, consistent in Virginia since he took office. Governor Northam’s job approval stands at 53%, steady for the last 12-15 months.
How the survey was conducted:
The results of this poll are based on 796 interviews of registered Virginia voters who have voted in at least two general elections in the last four years, including 163 on landline and 633 on cell phone, conducted September 9-21, 2020. Percentages may not equal 100 due to rounding. The margin of error for the whole survey is +/-3.9% at the 95% level of confidence. This means that if 50% of respondents indicate a topline view on an issue, we can be 95% confident that the population’s view on that issue is somewhere between 46.4% and 53.6%. The margin of error for the enthusiastic voter model (n=700) is +/- 3.6 at the 95% level of confidence. All error margins have been adjusted to account for the survey’s design effect, which is 1.1 in this survey. The design effect is a factor representing the survey’s deviation from a simple random sample and takes into account decreases in precision due to sample design and weighting procedures. Sub-samples have a higher margin of error. In addition to sampling error, the other potential sources of error include non-response, question wording, and interviewer error. The response rate (AAPOR RRI Standard Definition) for the survey was 10%. Five callbacks were employed in the fielding process. Live calling was conducted by trained interviewers at the Wason Center for Public Policy Survey Research Lab at Christopher Newport University. The data reported here are weighted using an iterative weighting process on region, age, race, sex, and education to reflect as closely as possible the population of Virginia’s 2020 electorate.""" ;

<https://coloradosun.com/2020/11/01/new-poll-colorado-biden-trump-hickenlooper-gardner/> dct:description """A new poll conducted just days before the 2020 election shows Democrats Joe Biden and John Hickenlooper are poised for double-digit victories in Colorado.
Biden, a Democrat, leads President Donald Trump 53% to 41% in the presidential race with only a fraction of voters undecided, according to the Keating Research poll of likely voters shared with The Colorado Sun. The Democratic firm correctly forecast the last two presidential elections in Colorado.
In the U.S. Senate race, Hickenlooper holds the advantage at 53% compared to 42% for Republican incumbent Cory Gardner. The margin of error for the poll — which was conducted Thursday through Sunday in partnership with OnSight Public Affairs — is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
“Biden and Hickenlooper’s numbers appear to be moving closer together, which means that as Coloradans cast their vote they are most likely to vote the same way in both races,” said Chris Keating, the pollster. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the Senate and presidential numbers in Colorado are very similar on election night.”
The latest numbers echo other Colorado polls in recent months showing both Democrats at the top of the ballot with solid leads. The polling averages since September show Biden ahead 12 points and Hickenlooper up 9 points, according to The Colorado Sun’s poll tracker.
Biden built his lead with support from women and younger voters, as well as Latinos and those not aligned with a political party.
Biden holds a 57% to 35% advantage among voters age 18 to 49 but the two candidates are evenly matched on those over 50, the poll showed. Unaffiliated voters — the largest bloc of voters so far in the 2020 election — favor Biden 55% to 31%.
The story is nearly identical in the Senate race. Hickenlooper leads Gardner 54% to 36% among unaffiliated voters, the poll found. He also is running up the score in liberal enclaves like Denver and Boulder.
Gardner wants to outperform Trump, but the latest numbers show they are locked in similar places.
“The progressive part of Colorado gets Hickenlooper, and this type of vote lead makes it impossible for Gardner to win, particularly when Hickenlooper also wins suburban voters by 19 points,” Keating said.
The poll also found voters aligned against Proposition 115, a ballot measure that would impose a ban on abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure gets just 38% support compared with 56% against.
The consistency of the Colorado polling in both races is leading experts to express confidence in the numbers, even as voters are anxious about the accuracy of national polling in the presidential election.
The question of whether voters can trust polls is one that Floyd Ciruli gets often. The director of the Crossley Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Denver said in a recent forum that “what you see is about what you get” in terms of the national and local polls.
“I’m pretty comfortable about Colorado as to the surveys we’ve seen here,” he said.
Rick Ridder, another prominent Democratic pollster, recently conducted a survey showing Biden and Hickenlooper with slightly larger leads. He says the numbers this year are stacked against the Republican incumbents.

“The real problem is Republicans are having a real difficult time breaking the 44% threshold,” Ridder said.
Dustin Olson, a Republican strategist whose company conducts polls, is less convinced by the numbers. He believes pollsters are not reaching enough Trump supporters, a problem that skewed some state-level polls in key 2016 battleground states. And others who answer the poll questions are not telling the truth.
“I wouldn’t say (polls) are going to be particularly accurate this election cycle,” he said.
The reason, he added: “I don’t think it’s just hidden Trump voters this election cycle. I think it’s just hidden Republican voters.”

<https://escxtra.com/2019/06/28/no-changes-approved-in-ebu-statutes-kosovo-cannot-apply-for-full-membership/> dct:description """Earlier this week it was reported to us by the EBU that on the agenda for the 82nd EBU General Assembly in Olso, Norway was a vote for changes to the current EBU statutes. Thus any approved changes could see the Kosovo broadcaster RTK apply for full membership status. However during today’s voting it has been revealed that no changes have been made and Kosovo still cannot apply for full EBU membership.
RTK’s EBU status remains unchanged
This week the EBU’s annual General Assembly is currently taking place. This meeting allows attendees and representatives from each national broadcaster to vote on changes that would be beneficial to the broadcasting region, as well as possible expansion. One such topic of contention has always been Kosovan broadcaster RTK’s yearly plight to obtain full EBU membership. Thus also being able to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest.
Today that hope has been dashed another blow. On the agenda was a decision to remove the criteria which required EBU members to be part of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Of course this is also a condition of being a member of the United Nations. As it stands, Kosovo does not have UN status. So removing the ITU requirement would have allowed the national broadcaster RTK to bypass these stipulations and apply for full EBU membership.
During the meeting numerous member countries, including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia and Spain called for a secret vote. This request was granted by the EBU. Therefore the final result was issued in secret. The results of which were 400 in favour, 673 against and 113 abstained. Thus any broadcaster applying for EBU membership must be part of the ITU and by extension the UN. At this time it means we won’t be seeing Kosovo debut at the 2020 contest in The Netherlands.
What next for Kosovo?
Although the door is currently closed at this time for RTK to apply for full EBU membership and participate in Eurovision, circumstances can still change. Every year the General Assembly convenes where votes on new regulations which could effect broadcasters, including RTK’s current standing with the EBU. Kosovo could in future join the ITU and the UN. However nations such as Spain and Serbia do not recognise Kosovo’s independence and thus this remains a stumbling block both for UN and EBU membership applications. Another option is to join the Council of Europe, which has been put forward in the past.
Furthermore the EBU could at any time choose to invite the RTK to the contest. There has been a precedent for this with RTK taking part in the 2011 edition of Eurovision Young Dancers. This ruling has allowed Australia (SBS) and Kazakhstan (Khabar Agency) to take part in Eurovision events.
What do you think of this decision? Do you want to see Kosovo take part in the contest? Let us know in the comments and on social media @ESCXTRA""" ;

Two Executive Producers and two Deputy Executive Producers – Inge van de Weerd, Sietse Bakker, Emilie Sickinghe and Jessica Stam have been appointed to the roles by AVROTROS, NOS and NPO. They will co-ordinate between the broadcasters and the EBU to ensure The Netherlands hosts a well organised contest next May.
Inge van de Weerd
As the Executive Producer TV, Inge van de Weerd’s role will be the project lead of managing the team involved in creating the broadcast of the 2020 contest. She is responsible for the entire show and is the main contact between the host broadcaster and the EBU. Since 1995 Inge has been part of the NOS broadcasting network. During this time she has worked on coverage of Dutch parliamentary elections, Prince’s Day and the Royal Wedding of Willem-Alexander and Maxima. She also has past Eurovision experience. Between 2007-2009 she was the Head of Delegation for The Netherlands.
We have a lot of experience at NOS on large live TV productions, but this event is exceptional. It’s going to be an amazing challenge bringing professionals from public broadcasting and the creative industry together to show what we have to offer in The Netherlands. Inge van de Weerd
Sietse Bakker
Many will know Sietse Bakker from his time working for the Eurovision Song Contest as the Online Manager and Communication Manager. More recently Sietse spent six years, until the 2016 Contest as the Event Supervisor for the EBU. For two years, which also included the Dutch hosting of the Junior Eurovision Contest 2012, Sietse worked as the Executive Supervisor of Junior Eurovision. Now he is appointed to the role of Executive Producer Event. This will include overseeing the management of all the events that surround the host city during the two week Eurovision period.
We want to create a Eurovision Song Contest that surprises Europe in a positive way, something that everyone in The Netherlands can identify themselves with and be proud of. We have set the bar high, but there is so much talent and creativity in The Netherlands that I am confident that it is possible. The ambition of this team to really make something special out of this, together with the chosen host city or region, is great! Sietse Bakker
Emilie Sickinghe
Since 2006 Emilie Sickinghe has been an important member of the Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS. Over the years Emilie has worked as a Producer of numerous music shows. Providing valuable cultural TV content to the audiences of The Netherlands on behalf of AVROTROS. Furthermore Emilie has been a familiar face in the Eurovision world. Since 2010 she has been in the role of the Head of Delegation for the Dutch broadcaster. During this decade she has overseen The Netherlands become a Eurovision powerhouse. With second place in 2014 and of course Duncan Laurence’s victory in May. At the winner’s press conference Jon Ola Sand handed Emilie a folder detailing guidelines for the hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest. Now Emilie will join the Core Team as a Deputy Executive Producer.
Jessica Stam
For many years Jessica has worked in a freelance role for NOS Events. This has provided her with vast experience in producing content for large scale events. Such as concerts, events and memorials of important national significance to The Netherlands. This has included a range of productions from National Veterans Day, the National Remembrance of MH17, the Koningsvaart and 3FM Serious Request. As well as this, Jessica has also worked as Executive Producer for the 538 Koningsdag and the Songfestival Sing Along festivals. Thus good preparation for the upcoming hosting of the 2020 contest. Now she joins the team as Deputy Executive Producer.
The EBU will announce more team members over the coming months. As details are finalised for the host city, venue and production budget. Of course also the eagerly anticipated dates of the contest!

A Junior Eurovision debut
Last year, Kazakh broadcaster Khabar TV made their debut in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Minsk. Deemed a success, Kazakhstan will be once again taking part in the contest this November in Gliwice, Poland.
During a press conference in Minsk, executive supervisor Jon Ola Sand informed press that potential participation of Kazakhstan in the adult contest was something that “needed to be discussed”.
EBU: “No plans”
With the deadline for broadcasters to confirm participation in Eurovision 2020 fast approaching, we reached out to the EBU to find out whether Kazakhstan would be invited to debut in next year’s contest.
We can confirm that we have no plans to invite Kazakhstan to participate in next year’s competition. EBU, 6 September 2019
Associate members must rely on invitations
As an associate member of the EBU, Kazakhstan’s Khabar Agency must rely on annual invitations to take part in a Eurovision contest in the same way Australia’s SBS has done. However, for the time being at least, Kazakhstan’s invitations will remain limited to the junior edition of the contest.""" ;

ESCToday have received confirmation of the news, following rumours earlier reported by Eurovision fan blogs Eurovision Fun and HOD45.
The reason for the withdrawal is financial, according to RTCG, the Montenegrin public broadcaster. They told ESCToday that the EBU had given the broadcaster an extension beyond the 10 October deadline to confirm its participation, but RTCG was unable to meet the requirements.
This is the second time Montenegro withdraws from the competition. The first withdrawal was during the two-year period 2010 – 2011, due to bad results and financial reasons.
Montenegro marks the second country, after Hungary, that participated in Eurovision Song Contest 2019, but that will be absent in Eurovision 2020 in Rotterdam. If no other circumstances occur, that makes it two withdrawals and two returns (Ukraine and Bulgaria) for Eurovision Song Contest 2020.
Montenegro in Eurovision
Montenegro has participated 11 times debuting as an independent country in 2007, qualifying twice and counting four consecutive shutouts in recent years. D Mol represent the country with the song “Heaven” earlier this year in Tel Aviv, finishing in 16th place in the 1st semifinal.

The text below - describing the content of the 3 live shows - remains as a tribute to the great work of Dutch Host Broadcasters NPO, AVROTROS and NOS.
Glennis Grace
Glennis Grace would have performed during the interval of the Grand Final with Afrojack. Glennis is no stranger to the Eurovision Song Contest; she participated in Kyiv in 2005 with the song My Impossible Dream.
Glennis Grace Marco Borsato
In 2012, Glennis formed the group Ladies of Soul, together with Dutch singers Trijntje Oosterhuis, Berget Lewis, Candy Dulfer and this year's co-host Edsilia Rombley. As a group, they sold out the Amsterdam Ziggo Dome twice in 2014. In 2018, she participated in America's Got Talent, where she sang Whitney Houston's Run To You during the audition round. Glennis got a standing ovation from both the public as well as the judges and made it to the final.
Afrojack in the Grand Final
DJ Afrojack was supposed to be part of an interval act during the Grand Final with an orchestra and choir; both created specifically for the Contest.
Dutch DJ Afrojack Frits van den Brink
Grammy award-winning DJ and producer, Nick van de Wall - professionally known as Afrojack - is one of the most notable and iconic names in electronic dance music (EDM) today. At only 26 years old, he has made a significant impact on the music industry and is a key player in the worldwide popularity of EDM. In 2019, he came 9th place in DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs.
A Winners’ Journey
During the scheduled Grand Final on 16 May, as voters at home would have made up their minds, 7 former winners would sing their Eurovision evergreens during an unforgettable medley. Bridging between the live audience in Ahoy and hotspots across Rotterdam, we would have opened up to former Eurovision winners and the Host City like never before.
Teach-In celebrating their 1975 win for the Netherlands at Schiphol Airport Rob Mieremet/Anefo (Nationaal Archief)
Gigliola Cinquetti (Italy 1964) would have sung her beautiful Non ho l'età, Lenny Kuhr (Netherlands 1969) would have performed De Troubadour and Teach-In’s Getty Kaspers (Netherlands 1975) would have sung Ding-A-Dong, the last Dutch Eurovision winner for 44 years, until she could pass on the baton to Duncan Laurence last year. Belgium’s Sandra Kim (1986) would have sung J’aime La Vie, Paul Harrington & Charlie McGettigan would once again perform Rock ‘n’ Roll Kids (Ireland 1994) and Alexander Rybak would have picked up his violin to perform Fairytale (Norway 2009). And of course, moments before passing on the trophy to the next Eurovision Song Contest winner, Duncan Laurence would have sung his Arcade once more.
Buckle up!
During each of the 3 live shows, Eurovision Song Contest presenter Edsilia Rombley (who represented the Netherlands in 1998 and 2007) would have been Eurovision's favourite taxi driver, driving around the streets of Rotterdam together with 4 past Eurovision winners: Ruslana (Ukraine 2004), Anne-Marie David (Luxembourg 1973), Izhar Cohen (Israel 1978) and Niamh Kavanagh (Ireland 1993). They would have talked about winning the Eurovision trophy and what the Contest has meant for their careers afterwards.
Esdilia Rombley will drive around various Eurovision winners during this year's live shows NPO/AVROTROS/NOS
Redo to breakdance into 2nd Semi-Final
Internationally renowned breakdancer and motivational speaker Redo (Redouan Aiit Chit) would have opened the 2nd Semi-Final with a spectacular performance.
Breakdancer Redo BAKI
Redo was born with several physical malformations. He has a shorter right arm, which lacks an elbow joint, and has a total of 5 fingers – 2 on the right hand and 3 on the left. He is also missing his right hip, has a shorter right leg, and walks with the aid of a prosthetic. Despite these complications, Redo never allowed his situation to negatively affect his life.
Gerben Bakker, Head of Show of the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest, said: "We would like to show Dutch talent in all its facets. Redo's enormous talent and story fit perfectly with the inclusivity and diversity of this year's contest and the theme Open Up!”
At age 14, Redo spotted a group of people b-boying (breakdancing) at his high school. It was love at first sight and he decided to take dance classes, despite his physical condition. Initially, he had a hard time learning the basics because he wasn’t able to manage all of the steps. However, through creativity, determination, and the encouragement of his friends, he was able to create a style of his own.
Breakdancer Redo Thijs Huizer
While Redo is familiar with international competitions and performing in front of big crowds, he considers this opportunity to be “next level”. Redo proves to anyone who thought of disabilities as limitations that anything is possible.""" ;

Posted 06 April 2020 at 15:52 CET
Intention to honour Eurovision 2020 songs and artists
We have been overwhelmed with the love that the Eurovision Song Contest family has shared since the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 event.
The EBU is very aware of how much the Eurovision Song Contest will be missed this year. The Contest’s values of universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music, are needed now more than ever.
The EBU and its Dutch Members NPO, NOS and AVROTROS are producing a new show, 'Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light', to air in place of the Grand Final on Saturday 16 May at 21:00 CEST. To help unite and entertain audiences around Europe during these challenging times.
It is our intention with this programming, and on our online platforms in the coming months, to honour the songs and artists which have been chosen for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.
With that in mind, the Reference Group, the Song Contest’s governing board, has decided that, in accordance with the Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, this year’s songs will not be eligible to compete when the Contest returns in 2021.
At their discretion, Participating Broadcasters may decide which artist(s) to send in 2021, either this year’s representative or a new one.
We ask for your continued patience while we work through practical implications of these ideas in the coming days and weeks.

Posted 20 March 2020 at 20:30 CET
Statement
Over the past few weeks, we have explored many alternative options to allow the Eurovision Song Contest to go ahead.
However, the uncertainty created by the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe – and the restrictions put in place by the governments of the participating broadcasters and the Dutch authorities - means the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has taken the difficult decision to not continue with the live event as planned.
We are very proud that the Eurovision Song Contest has united audiences every year, without interruption, for the past 64 years and we, like the millions of fans around the world, are extremely saddened that it can not take place in May.
The EBU, NPO, NOS, AVROTROS and the City of Rotterdam will continue in conversation regarding the hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021.
We ask some patience as we work through the ramifications of this unprecedented decision and patiently await further news in the coming days and weeks.
During that time, we would like to pay tribute to all the Host Broadcaster team in the Netherlands and our 41 Members who have worked so hard planning this year’s event.
We are all heartbroken that the Eurovision Song Contest will not be able to be staged in May but feel confident that the whole Eurovision family, across the world, will continue to provide love and support for each other at this difficult time.
Frequently Asked Questions
Why are you cancelling the Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam?
With the escalating spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe – and the restrictions put in place by the governments of participating broadcasters and the Dutch authorities - it is impossible to continue with the live event as planned.
Why not postpone the event?
The current situation across Europe is likely to remain uncertain for the coming months and at this stage we cannot guarantee we would be able to stage an event of this size with this many stakeholders later this year. A Contest later in the year would also reduce the amount of time the winning broadcaster would have to prepare for the following year’s competition.
Could you not have held the contest without an audience?
We are carefully following the advice of the relevant authorities to protect the health and wellbeing of all citizens. Dutch restrictions on gatherings of large numbers of people and international travel restrictions mean that holding the event, even without an audience, is impossible at this time.
Why couldn’t you have held the show remotely?
It’s in the DNA of the Eurovision Song Contest to bring delegations, artists and fans together in one place and provide an equal platform for all artists to compete together on the same stage and the same opportunity to shine. We felt that under the extreme circumstances we face this year, organizing the Eurovision Song Contest in another way would not be in keeping with our values and the tradition of the event.
The unique format of the Song Contest as an international live event means that it is not possible to identify any realistic alternative. We therefore have no choice other than to cancel the show.
Why will this year’s songs not be eligible to compete in 2021?
The Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group, which represents all participating broadcasters, agreed that the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest should be upheld for the event when it returns in 2021. This means that the songs that compete next year cannot be commercially available before 1 September 2020, which excludes the current selection of songs chosen for this year’s cancelled event.
However, participating broadcasters can choose to send the artist selected for this year’s Contest should they wish, or choose a new one. We know the decision is disappointing for many, but the EBU and its Members intend to celebrate this year’s songs in the coming months in the absence of a Contest in 2020.
In making the decision the Reference Group took into account that the EBU, the 41 participating broadcasters and Universal Music would be showcasing this year’s songs and artists in alternative programming, on a tribute CD and on all our digital channels as much as possible in the coming weeks.
They also looked at the fact that bringing the same songs to the ESC 2021 would not be in the spirit of the Contest and the excitement and engagement created every year during “selection season” would be lost. This would impact the build up to the event on social media, online and on air for the participating broadcasters during the national finals and the preview shows.
They agreed, that abandoning the 1 September rule for commercial release, even in these unprecedented circumstances, would lead to an unfair competition in 2021, where some broadcasters could choose to submit this year’s song or choose a newer song.
What will happen to my ticket?
You will be informed about this as soon as possible. Among other things, we will look at whether the buyers will get their money back or whether the tickets will remain valid until next year. As soon as there is more clarity, ticket buyers will receive an email with their various options at the email address from which they purchased their tickets.
Can I get a refund now?
At the moment we are looking into the various options. As soon as we have more information, this will be communicated on songfestival.nl.
What happens to my tickets that I bought on Ticketswap, via AVROTROS, or via the fan club (OGAE)?
The same applies here as for "regular" ticket buyers. As soon as we have more information, this will be communicated on songfestival.nl and you will receive an email at the email address from which you booked the tickets.
Do we have a date for next year’s Contest?
The EBU, NPO, NOS, AVROTROS and the City of Rotterdam are continuing their conversation regarding the potential hosting of the Contest in 2021. It is currently too early to discuss any specifics regarding the event next year.
What about the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 CD?
The official Eurovision Song Contest 2020 double CD will be released as a tribute album featuring the songs from all 41 countries. The CD will be available from 15 May 2020 and can be pre-ordered in the Eurovision shop.""" ;

EuroClub
The Eurovision Song Contest 2020's official EuroClub was supposed to be located in the Maassilo in Rotterdam.

Maassilo is one of the most spectacular club venues in the Netherlands and the place to go for a great night out. It is known for its innovative mix of dance, pop, art and theatre events.
Eurovision Village
The Eurovision Village was supposed to be located on the Binnenrotte market square in the centre of Rotterdam. It’s almost impossible to envision Rotterdam’s humble origins on this spot by the little Rotte River.
Rotterdam Iris van den Broek
The Binnenrotte market square is a cosmopolitan area featuring hypermodern architecture, like the Markthal. This characteristic area welcomes visitors on a daily basis and, over the last few years, there has been an increase of travellers to this exciting Rotterdam hotspot.
The market square is the official festival area where visitors would have seen live performances from artists and DJs, and would have watched the live broadcast shows.

<https://eurovision.tv/story/australia-secures-spot-in-eurovision-until-2023> dct:description """Broadcaster SBS and their production partner Blink TV have secured Australia’s participation as a competitor at the Eurovision Song Contest for the next five years, until 2023.
This year will mark Australia’s fifth participation since the country took part for the first time during the contest's 60th anniversary in 2015. Until now, Australia's right to participate was up for consideration year by year. Now, for the first time, a five year guarantee was given to broadcaster SBS.
"Home for 35 years"
“SBS has been the home of the Eurovision Song Contest in Australia for 35 years and we’re thrilled at this invitation to become a more permanent member of the Eurovision Song Contest family," SBS Commissioning Editor Josh Martin said. "We will continue to showcase Australia’s amazing talent and diversity to hundreds of millions of people across Europe and the world. It highlights the power of music to bring people together – even from polar opposite sides of the globe. Thank you Europe!"
The 2018 Eurovision Song Contest reached more than 2.9 million Australians on SBS.
Australia decided
Australian Head of Delegation and Director of Blink TV Paul Clarke is extatic about the latest developments: “This is a wonderful validation of what Australia has brought to Eurovision, and we say 'Thank You Europe!' for their decision. It’s been ten years since we first took a team to Eurovision—just Julia and Sam, myself and a cameraman. Since then SBS’s coverage has grown, and the Australian music artists and industry have completely risen to the exciting challenge. Australians have really fallen in love with the joy, and Eurovision has become part of the Australian entertainment calendar. Europe knows it can always expect great music and passion from Australia."
Australia's love affair with Eurovision has been a passionate and enduring one and, this year, SBS and Blink TV launched the country’s first ever selection show Eurovision – Australia Decides to determine the artist and song to represent the country on the world’s biggest stage.
A natural progression
The decision to grant Australia the right to participate for the next five years was taken by the Reference Group, the contest's governing body on behalf of the Participating Broadcasters. Jon Ola Sand, Executive Supervisor of the contest on behalf of the EBU and one of the permanent members of the Reference Group, said: "We are delighted that Australia has become a more permanent member of the Eurovision Song Contest family. The Australians have long been huge fans of the event with a great number of loyal viewers year on year and when they were invited to participate in the 60th anniversary edition of the Contest, we couldn’t have imagined quite how popular their artists would become. It was a natural progression for us to agree to their inclusion as a participant for the next five years as they bring so much to the table and we very much look forward to welcoming them to Tel Aviv to perform, alongside the 41 other exciting participants in what’s sure to be a fantastic celebration of music."
Australia‘s participation this year
After winning over the Australian public and a jury of industry experts on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 February, Kate Miller-Heidke and her song Zero Gravity were selected to represent Australia at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Kate will perform in the second half of the first Semi-Final on the 14th of May.

Each artist gets to experience their own unique piece of the Netherlands prior to the Eurovision Song Contest, by participating in a Dutch activity, tradition or hobby. This will form the basis of the videos - the so-called postcards - which, entirely in the tradition of the Contest, introduce the performances of the artists during the Semi-Finals and the Grand Final.

The choice of cover will be voted on by our social media followers using a poll with song options chosen by the artist themselves. Keep an eye out for artist announcements on our social channels and the opportunity to weigh in on which song the artists will record!

<https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-song-contest-to-return-to-rotterdam-in-2021> dct:description """The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and its Dutch Members NPO, NOS and AVROTROS are excited to have reached an agreement to stage the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam at the Ahoy Arena. The Dutch city was due to host the Contest this month before the event was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The Host City for the 65th Eurovision Song Contest was announced during Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, which was broadcast by EBU Members and Associates in over 40 countries in place of this year’s Grand Final on 16 May.
Following the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, the EBU, NPO, NOS, AVROTROS and the City of Rotterdam entered constructive discussions on the possibilities of staging the 65th edition of the world’s largest live music event in Rotterdam.
Martin Österdahl, the Eurovision Song Contest’s new Executive Supervisor, said:
We are extremely happy that we can now move forward. It’s vitally important that the Eurovision Song Contest returns next year, and we’re pleased to have the necessary commitment from our Members in the Netherlands to bring this much-loved show back to audiences across the world. I firmly believe that all of us involved in the Eurovision Song Contest will stand united through challenges and change to bring the Contest back stronger than ever, ensuring its longevity for decades to come.
Developments surrounding COVID-19 will clearly affect planning in the coming year for a complicated global broadcast with many international stakeholders. In this ever-changing and challenging environment, the EBU will, therefore, work with its Dutch Members and the City of Rotterdam to ensure the continuity of the event in a number of different scenarios.

“Now more than ever it is important that we, as a public broadcaster, are committed to continuing this European tradition and are organizing a great event that people can look forward to during these difficult times. We will do everything in our power to arrange a very special Contest,” said NPO Chairman, Shula Rijxman.
Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer Event, added: “Our team is proud and excited to look forward with renewed energy to organize a fantastic Eurovision Song Contest in 2021. Yes, with a sense of realism that fits with the times we live in, but also with ambition and creativity. We are looking forward to working with the entire Eurovision family to make it happen.”
Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer Event Stijn Smulders
To date, 18 of the artists planned for 2020 have confirmed that they will represent their country again in 2021. More details about the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, including dates for the event, will be released in the coming weeks and months.

<https://eurovision.tv/story/fans-gather-behind-eurovision-again> dct:description """As people from across the continent refrain from getting together to avoid the coronavirus spread, Eurovision fans have found a clever way to enjoy the contest together. At the initiative of Eurovision Song Contest fan Rob Holley, every Saturday at 20:00 GMT (21:00 CEST), #EurovisionAgain hosts synced viewings of classic Eurovision Song Contests for fans to watch together at home, commenting on Twitter.
Once word started to spread after the first edition of #EurovisionAgain, a growing amount of fans joined the 28 March viewing of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest from Athens. The hashtag became trending on Twitter in the UK and even Spanish contestants Las Ketchup made it to the top-10.
The project was initiated by Rob Holley, a journalist who writes about Eurovision, pop music, travel and LGBTQ+ issues for, amongst others, The Independent. He says to Eurovision.tv: "I’m not hugely surprised by the popularity because the Eurovision Song Contest is the ultimate group viewing experience and the fandom is super enthusiastic."
The buy-in has expanded to known Eurovision names, as well. Holley: "In week one we saw Cascada and Sarah Dawn Finer comment on the tweet-along, and then last week UK 2006 artist Daz Sampson recorded an introduction for #EurovisionAgain…. and we might have someone special lined up for this Saturday too."
To add suspense, which Eurovision Song Contest will air on the night will be revealed only 15 minutes before the show starts. This week, fans gather to watch the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 from Moscow.
"It's so packed with love"
Holley got inspired to start #EurovisionAgain after the cancellation of the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam, which he expected to attend: "The cancellation got me thinking about the things I’ll miss, but also the joyful bits that fans recreate all year round. One of the funnest aspects of Eurovision is the Saturday night tweet-a-long. It’s so packed with love."
How to get involved
Once announced, fans can stream the chosen Eurovision Song Contest of the week starting at 21:00 CEST sharp and tweet along using the hashtag #EurovisionAgain.
#EurovisionAgain will also provide printable scorecards so you can be part of the voting magic. Once all acts have performed, they intend to publish a voting site, announced on Twitter, where fans can award points to nations as if they were members of the jury. The votes will be counted and verified by the project's 'Executive Supervisor' before they reveal the full scoreboard and, of course, the #EurovisionAgain winner of the evening.
The result of the vote after last week's viewing of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 was quite a departure from the real scores. Lordi finished as runner-up to the triumphant Carola from Sweden, who finished 5th in Athens with her song Invincible.
The EBU has backed the initiative by facilitating more Contests to be available online. "It’s great that the EBU reached out to us to say they’ve enjoyed our fan project, and I’m over the moon that they’re looking into ways of working to get old contests online to coincide with #EurovisionAgain on a Saturday night - that’s an incredible commitment to fans," Holley concludes.

A Winners’ Journey
During the Grand Final on 16 May, as voters at home make up their minds, 7 former winners will sing their Eurovision evergreens during an unforgettable medley. Bridging between the live audience in Ahoy and hotspots across Rotterdam, we’ll open up to former Eurovision winners and the Host City like never before.
Gigliola Cinquetti (Italy 1964) will sing her beautiful Non ho l'età, Lenny Kuhr (Netherlands 1969) will perform De Troubadour and Teach-In’s Getty Kaspers (Netherlands 1975) will sing Ding-A-Dong, the last Dutch Eurovision winner for 44 years, until she could pass on the baton to Duncan Laurence last year. Belgium’s Sandra Kim (1986) will sing J’aime La Vie, Paul Harrington & Charlie McGettigan will once again perform Rock ‘n’ Roll Kids (Ireland 1994) and Alexander Rybak will pick up his violin to perform Fairytale (Norway 2009). And of course, moments before passing on the trophy to the next Eurovision Song Contest winner, Duncan Laurence will sing his Arcade once more.
Buckle up!
During each of the 3 live shows, Eurovision Song Contest presenter Edsilia Rombley (who represented the Netherlands in 1998 and 2007) will be Eurovision's favourite taxi driver, driving around the streets of Rotterdam together with 4 past Eurovision winners: Ruslana (Ukraine 2004), Anne-Marie David (Luxembourg 1973), Izhar Cohen (Israel 1978) and Niamh Kavanagh (Ireland 1993). They will talk about winning the Eurovision trophy and what the Contest has meant for their careers afterwards. And who knows what else will happen while on the road!

Redo to breakdance into 2nd Semi-Final
Internationally renowned breakdancer and motivational speaker Redo (Redouan Aiit Chit) will open the 2nd Semi-Final with a spectacular performance.
Breakdancer Redo BAKI
Redo was born with several physical malformations. He has a shorter right arm, which lacks an elbow joint, and has a total of 5 fingers – 2 on the right hand and 3 on the left. He is also missing his right hip, has a shorter right leg, and walks with the aid of a prosthetic. Despite these complications, Redo never allowed his situation to negatively affect his life.
Gerben Bakker, Head of Show of the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest, says: "We would like to show Dutch talent in all its facets. Redo's enormous talent and story fit perfectly with the inclusivity and diversity of this year's contest and the theme Open Up!”
At age 14, Redo spotted a group of people b-boying (breakdancing) at his high school. It was love at first sight and he decided to take dance classes, despite his physical condition. Initially, he had a hard time learning the basics because he wasn’t able to manage all of the steps. However, through creativity, determination, and the encouragement of his friends, he was able to create a style of his own.
While Redo is familiar with international competitions and performing in front of big crowds, he considers this opportunity to be “next level”. Redo proves to anyone who thought of disabilities as limitations that anything is possible.

The EBU is very aware of how much the Eurovision Song Contest will be missed this year. The Contest’s values of universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music, are needed now more than ever.
As such, the EBU and its Members are currently exploring alternative programming, but not a competition, to help unite and entertain audiences around Europe during these challenging times.
It is our intention with this programming, and on our online platforms in the coming months, to honour the songs and artists which have been chosen for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.
With that in mind, the Reference Group, the Song Contest’s governing board, has decided that, in accordance with the Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, this year’s songs will not be eligible to compete when the Contest returns in 2021.
At their discretion, Participating Broadcasters may decide which artist(s) to send in 2021, either this year’s representative or a new one.

Jon Ola will also leave the Head of Live Events post which oversees the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Eurovision Young Musicians and Eurovision Choir competitions.

“Rotterdam will be my 10th Contest as Executive Supervisor and it seems a good time to pass on the baton and take on a new challenge at NRK. In my new role I will work to ensure that NRK continues to be a world-class public broadcaster and will be in the best possible shape for the future.”
NRK DG Thor Gjermund Eriksen is pleased to welcome Jon Ola back to NRK: “It is brilliant that Jon Ola is coming home. With his background and vast experience, he will help develop NRK as a public broadcaster and production house and prepare us to move into our brand new home.”

“The slogan ‘Open Up’ is intentionally incomplete: Open up to each other. Open up to music. Open up to Rotterdam. Open up to... whatever you choose! Feel the freedom to complete the slogan in your own way. That way we get to know each other better,” says Sietse Bakker, Executive Producer Event of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.
“We have looked for a theme and slogan that reflect what the Netherlands stands for and which the Dutch can identify with; a country with an open mind to the world, where we speak our mind, with respect for each other. We also found it important to choose a theme that reflects the spirit of our times. People are concerned about increasing polarization and freedom isn’t as self-evident for everyone as it should be," emphasised Sietse. "With the slogan 'Open Up’, we warmly invite people to open up to others, to different opinions, each other's stories and of course to each other's music.”
The Eurovision Song Contest was established 10 years after the Second World War to bring Europe closer together through music. In recent decades, the competition has continuously opened itself up to new countries, new talent and new technology. In 2020, the 65th edition will take place in Rotterdam, 75 years after the liberation of the Netherlands and 80 years after a devastating bombardment of the city
Jon Ola Sand, Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest for the EBU affirmed the fit of the slogan for this year’s Contest: “Open Up is the perfect slogan for the Eurovision Song Contest as it celebrates its 65th edition. In 1956, only 7 countries could watch the competition and since then we have opened up to the whole of Europe, to Australia and now, via streaming, to the whole world. The values of the Eurovision Song Contest are universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music. Now we can add a new one – that of openness.”

Rotterdam is the largest port city in Europe; 469 million tonnes of goods transferred through it in 2018. From a logistical point of view, the port is of great importance when it comes to the import and export of goods for Europe, leading to a large part of it being named the Europoort.

South Holland, the province in which Rotterdam is located, is the most multicultural region in the Netherlands. The city itself is home to 174 nationalities, and all participating countries of the Eurovision Song Contest are represented in the local population.

Rotterdam is also an architectural city. In the city centre, which was largely destroyed in 1940, you will find a diversity of building styles: icons of the new build stand alongside reconstruction architecture from the sixties, seventies and eighties. They cheerfully clash with the ultramodern skyscrapers and iconic buildings such as the Markthal, which have been added in recent decades.
The Netherlands won the right to stage next year’s event when Duncan Laurence gave his country its first win since 1975 with the song Arcade in Tel Aviv. As if to come full circle, Rotterdam is also home to the Maassilo, a former grain silo turned arts centre where Duncan Laurence recorded his winning song. This will be the fifth time the Netherlands has hosted the Contest.

This year’s meeting was compounded by the aftermath of the coronavirus flare, which resulted in six delegations not to go to Rotterdam but to participate via live streaming. These countries were Sweden, Finland, Israel, Switzerland, Italy and of course as you first read at Eurovision Fun Greece. But there were also some absences from the EBU after an outbreak of the virus was detected by an organization employee in Geneva. As a result, all union officials were put on a travel ban and quarantined, and as a result, no one went to Rotterdam for the meeting of leaders, including chief executive Jon Ola Sand.
The meeting, however, went smoothly and the organizers had the opportunity to present to delegations everything they were preparing for Eurovision 2020. The producer of this year’s competition, Sietse Bakker, said in his statement that everything was humanly possible in order for Eurovision 2020 to normally held in May in Rotterdam.

Luxembourg is one of the countries that won the most Eurovision in the time they participated in the competition
A petition by fans of the contest has been sent to RTL as well as the Chamber of Deputies, which states:
Can we really believe that the Grand Duchy does not have the means to pay the €150,000 fee to participate in Eurovision, unlike the small state of San Marino? Any sponsor or sponsor would be happy to support RTL, which would gain a strong audiovisual audience!
Let’s admit that in terms of “Nation branding”, Eurovision is a boon for Luxembourg. We can not pretend to weigh on the European stage and refuse to participate in the only festive event that genuinely brings together the popular public of our continent.
Luxembourg last participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1993 and were represented by Modern Times with the song “Donne-moi une chance”, they finished 20th with 11 points.
Mr Schmit, the Director of Programming at the Luxembourgish broadcaster explained in 2017 the reasons against participating in the Eurovision Song Contest,
For participation it’s simple, we could call upon the sponsor and there were openings at this stage, a few years ago. But the big risk, and it is shared by public bodies is that we can not bear the costs related to the organisation of Eurovision next year.
He also underlined that Luxembourg’s chance for success in the contest is limited,
I believe that (with) the enlargement of Eurovision, the days (of victory) are gone. With the new voting system, it is very unlikely that Luxembourg is successful. Small countries are somewhat more troubled now.
Luxembourg did plan to return to the contest during the mid 00s. In 2004 Luxembourg was announced as one of countries returning or debuting in that years contest alongside Andorra, Albania and Belarus. The broadcaster withdrew ahead of the contest due to financial issues.

Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest Montenegro debuted at the Eurovision Song Contest as an independent country in 2007, and participated until 2010 when they withdrew for financial reasons. They returned to the contest in 2012, and since then have always chosen their entry internally. Montenegro failed to qualify for the grand final until 2014, when Sergej Ćetković and his song “Moj svijet” placed 19th in the final. Their best result came a year later, when Knez performed “Adio” in Vienna. They have never reached the top 10, with Knez reaching 13th out of 27 countries.""" ;

The Governing party of Andorra, has confirmed that the nation will return to the Eurovision Song Contest, having last participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009. In a statement to the paper, the majority party in the Government in Andorra, Demòcrates, stated:
RTVA will return to Eurovision but, before, a cost assessment must be made.
This is the first time in a number of years that a return by Andorra to the Eurovision Song Contest, has been backed by the Governing party in the nation.
Return to the competition has the backing of Andorra Turismo, the nations tourism ministry. Who view Andorra’s participation in the contest, as a massive opportunity to promote the nation to viewers across the globe.
Andorra last participated in the Eurovision Song Contest a decade ago, having failed to make it to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest since their debut in 2004. Local political group Ciutadans Compromesos added:
Return to the competition would be positive, although it would be an important cost for the station, although this issue lies in the management of the budget available and the prioritization of projects, but in any case, it would be good that it could be assumed
Plans for RTVA to return to the contest have been welcomed by a number of figures in the nation. Enric Castellet the Former Director General of RTVA between 1995-2005 and 2008-2010 commented:
I want us to return for the press that moves, the networks that do not stop talking and the millions of spectators who see it because, all this, translates into great publicity for Andorra that it could hardly be done otherwise.
Former participants including Susanne Georgi (2009), Nick Gain (2007), Marian Van de Wal (2005) and Jenny (2006), all had messages of support for the nations return to the competition.
RTVA has not yet responded to the reports from El Nacional. Previously the Head of RTVA, Xavier Mujal commented that a return to the Eurovision Song Contest could not happen unless there was Government support.
It is not known how soon Andorra could return to the Eurovision Song Contest, and when the assessment on the feasibility of a return to the contest will be carried out.

<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-asian-americans-are-thinking-about-the-2020-election/> dct:description """Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.
Poll of the week
Asian American voters didn’t always lean Democratic. In 1992, less than a third of Asian Americans voted Democratic. But nowadays, most Asian Americans identify as Democrats, with more than half saying they plan to back Joe Biden and less than a third saying they’d vote for President Trump, according to the latest Asian American Voter Survey released this week.
Asian American voters are hardly a monolith. The different groups that comprise Asian American voters are divided over how much — and whether — they will back Biden for president. For instance, Filipino Americans are more evenly divided among supporting Biden and Trump than Japanese Americans. And Indian Americans, who have been reliably Democratic for years, now show some signs of slowly shifting to the right. Finally, Vietnamese Americans lean pretty consistently Republican.
Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing racial or ethnic segments of eligible voters in the United States. and make up 4.7 percent of all eligible voters, but there hasn’t been that much reliable polling on Asian Americans, so this survey provides one of the few snapshots of how Asian American voters feel about the upcoming presidential election.
That said, it’s important that we don’t read too much into one survey. Only about 250 respondents were in each subgroup, putting the margin of error at +/- 6 percentage points for each group. But by looking at how Asian Americans have politically identified since 2012, we can more clearly see some of the trends in this most recent survey. What immediately jumps out is that while Asian Americans are very Democratic-leaning overall, Republicans have been making some headway — particularly among certain groups of national origin — over the last few elections.
Take Vietnamese Americans, who among Asian Americans are the most likely to identify as Republican. Anabelle Vo, a 30-year-old video editor based in Los Angeles who started a podcast called Mỹ Gốc Việt (“Americans from Vietnam”) along with her childhood friend Bee Ngo, told me this is partly because the Vietnam War still looms large in how many older Vietnamese Americans identify politically. Many Vietnamese Americans fled to the U.S. after the war, and Vo said they may support the Republican Party because they view it as more strongly anti-communist than the Democratic Party. Her friend and podcast co-host, Ngo, also pointed out that many Vietnamese Americans who identify as Catholic may be more socially conservative, a factor that could also explain why Filipino Americans, 65 percent of whom are Catholic, are more likely to support Republicans than other groups of Asian Americans.
But it’s unclear how strong some of these trends are, according to Linda Vo, a professor in the Department of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Irvine. For instance, even though many Vietnamese Americans identify as Republicans, there is some evidence that they might be moving away from the party. And much of this comes down to age, which was a possible cleavage among Asian American voters in the Democratic primary. Both Anabelle Vo and Ngo have noticed a distinct generational divide in their own personal experiences, with younger Vietnamese Americans much more likely to identify with the Democratic Party than would their parents or grandparents. This is something that Linda Vo has also noticed in her research. “[T]here is a definite generational divide,” Vo said. “That younger generation tends to be for the Democratic Party and tends to have more progressive politics.” She did say the politics of Vietnamese Americans were changing, but slowly.
On the other hand, Republicans have seen modest gains among Indian Americans, who are the most Democratic-leaning group of Asian Americans. Some of this may have to do with increased mobilization efforts by activist groups like the Republican Hindu Coalition, who capitalized on ideological overlaps between Trump and India’s popular nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016, leading some Indian Americans to vote Republican. Only 21 percent of Indian Americans identify with, or lean towards, the Republican Party, but that’s still roughly double what it was in 2012.
However, the majority of Asian Americans do identify as Democrats. And that could be in part because there is a lot of overlap between the policy preferences of Asian Americans of every stripe and those espoused by the Democratic Party. For instance, according to the survey, 81 percent of Asian Americans support stricter gun laws, 77 percent support stronger legislation to address climate change, 70 percent support affirmative action in higher education, 63 percent believe the government should do more to give Black Americans equal rights with white Americans, 59 percent support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, 59 percent support shifting funding away from law enforcement, and 55 percent support expanding access to health insurance to all immigrants regardless of legal status.
“When you break it down to certain issues like health care and things like that, that’s how it gets easier for me to discuss things with older folks,” Anabelle Vo said. Vo describes herself as more progressive than the typical Democratic voter and has attended demonstrations and marches for like-minded causes. And interestingly, there weren’t significant divides on these issues between more conservative Asian American groups, like Vietnamese Americans, and more liberal Asian American groups, like Indian Americans. For instance, Vietnamese Americans were more likely to favor stricter gun control legislation, policies to curb climate change and affirmative action, than Asian Americans as a whole.
If Republicans are looking to persuade Asian Americans, however, there is one potential issue where they may have the upperhand. Ninety percent of Asian Americans said that jobs and the economy are either “extremely” or “very” important. And on that issue, 35 percent said that Republicans are doing a better job, while only 31 percent said Democrats are. The rest said there was no difference, or that they don’t know.
It is hard to imagine that Asian American voters will greatly shift in their support before the election, so the real question is whether they’ll come out to the polls (or mail in their ballot). The survey did find high levels of enthusiasm for voting (82 percent said they were at least as enthusiastic about voting this year as they were in previous elections, with more than half saying they were more enthusiastic), but outreach from political parties has been very low. Only 30 percent of Asian American voters said they have been contacted by the Democratic Party in the past year, and only 24 percent said they have been contacted by the Republican Party.
And if the race ends up being anything like 2016, where Trump won key states like Michigan with razor-thin margins, turnout among this relatively small — but growing — subset of the electorate could matter.
Other polling bites
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 43.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -9.5 points). At this time last week, 42.7 percent approved and 53.1 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -10.4 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.0 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.0 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.0 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.4 percentage points (48.6 percent to 42.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.6 points (48.5 percent to 42.0 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.3 points (48.5 percent to 41.2 percent).""" ;

<https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2007/micronesia> dct:description """In 2006, the government of the Federated States of Micronesia developed justice guidelines and a training handbook for law enforcement personnel to use in protecting the rights of juveniles. Officials also continued efforts to improve the country’s education system.
The United States administered Micronesia, which included the Marshall Islands and other Pacific island groups, between 1947 and 1979 as a UN Trusteeship Territory. In 1970, the Northern Marianas, Marshall Islands, and Palau demanded separate status from Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, and Yap; these latter four territories, representing 607 islands, became the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The FSM adopted a constitution and became self-governing in 1979 as the trusteeship expired and status negotiations with the United States continued.
In 1986, the independent FSM signed its first Compact of Free Association with the United States, acquiring U.S. economic assistance and external defense and granting the United States the right to establish military bases in the islands. A new compact extending the same core commitment for another 20 years came into effect in December 2003. In the first three years of the new pact, the FSM received $76 million in economic assistance for education, health, the environment, capacity building, infrastructure, and private sector development; another $16 million goes to a trust fund that is overseen by a joint board of U.S. and FSM trustees. Beginning in the fourth year, an annual decrement of $800,000 from sectoral grants will be reallocated to the trust fund until 2023. FSM citizens will also continue to enjoy visa-free entry to the United States, access to health services and education, and the ability to work without employment visas in the United States.
Compact funds represent one-third of the country’s national income, and the division of those funds has been a source of serious tension in federal-state relations. In 2003, the people of Faichuk island in the state of Chuuk threatened to leave the federation and seek a separate bilateral treaty with the United States unless Chuuk received a larger share of the compact funds; Faichuk is home to 30 percent of Chuuk’s population. Other states soon followed with similar demands. In response, the federal government agreed to increase the share of compact funds provided to the four states.
In May 2003, the legislature elected Joseph Urusemal, a former governor of Yap, over former president Leo Falcam to be the sixth president of the FSM. Redley Killion, who had been vice president in Falcam’s administration, was again chosen as vice president. In the March 2005 congressional elections, most incumbents were reelected. Proposed constitutional amendments to allow direct election of the president and vice president obtained support from more than 50 percent of the voters but fell short of the three-quarters majority required to pass.
The Department of Justice in 2006 developed guidelines and a training workbook to aid law enforcement personnel in protecting the rights of young people. The government also continued to struggle with limited resources to improve the delivery of education and other public services. The need to improve education and training was particularly emphasized, since foreign workers are imported when the native population is unprepared to take advantage of job opportunities, and unemployment among the native population creates tension with the foreign workers.""" ;

The so-called Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Toronto mass shooting, calling the attacker a “soldier” who was responding to calls to “target citizens of coalition countries.”
The statement issued Wednesday by Amaq, an ISIS mouthpiece, provided no evidence the terrorist group was linked to Sunday’s shooting that killed two and wounded 13.

But police officials continued to caution that there was still no indication of any link to national security and that it would take time to determine the attacker’s motive.
“At this stage, we have no evidence to support these claims,” said a statement issued by Toronto police chief Mark Saunders.
“Accurate information about this investigation will only be released by the Toronto Police Service. We will continue to explore every investigative avenue including interviewing those who knew Mr. Hussain, reviewing his online activity, and looking into his experiences with mental health”.

“ISIS claims used to be fairly solid. If they claimed an attack, you could be fairly certain that the attacker was in contact with somebody linked to ISIS central,” said Prof. Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
“But maybe for about a year, and including the Vegas shooting, their claims are less reliable, it seems to me. And the sources they site are often just media reports. This is why I said I was fairly confident ISIS would claim the attack after CBS did their article. For ISIS, these days, that seems to be enough confirmation. I call bulls**t.”

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Tuesday there was no national security link to the gun attack in Toronto’s Greektown by Faisal Hussain, a 29-year-old retail worker.
“We have nothing to add to our previous statement,” Hilary Peirce, spokesperson for the public safety minister, said Wednesday. “Toronto Police remain the lead and it’s still early in the investigation.
“At this time, there is no national security nexus to the shooter,” Peirce said.
According to a statement issued by his family, Hussain suffered from severe mental health problems. Police sources have also said he had been previously apprehended under the Mental Health Act.

Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin said ISIS used to claim only attacks by those who had pledged allegiance to the terror group.
“Recently, however, the group has been far less disciplined, claiming things like the Las Vegas shooting,” the national security expert said.
“This may be due to a lack of capacity to conduct large-scale attacks or a need to stay in the headlines. So my assessment is that this is not definitive proof, especially as our own police and federal agencies are still saying there is no national security nexus at this point.

Melissa Nason, 36, who lives in an apartment next door to where the shooting happened, said she woke up around 7 a.m. and heard about “20 shots fired.”
“There were breaks in between the shooting,” she said. “I could not see anything from where I was. Police did not want anyone to be near the window.” Tweet This

MacCoubrey said three gunshots woke him up, and as many as 17 more have been fired between that time and around 8:30 a.m. He said his apartment complex has four buildings in a square, and it sounded like the shots were coming from the middle of the complex.

A man charged with multiple murders at a Fredericton apartment complex is being described as seemingly “polite and pleasant,” with police yet unable to offer the public any alleged motive for Friday’s burst of violence.
Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, of Fredericton is accused of killing 32-year-old Bobbie Lee Wright, her boyfriend Donnie Robichaud, and police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns, police said Saturday.
Raymond has lived in the complex for about four months, said Judith Aguilar, an office manager for Sunfield Apartment Rentals, the complex’s owners. Aguilar said he is an avid cyclist who often came into pay his rent in cash while wearing a bike helmet.
“He seemed like a reasonably normal person. He seemed normal and made small talk every time you saw him,” Aguilar said Saturday. Tweet This

“He came in every month to pay rent. He was always polite and pleasant.”

Both Robichaud, 42, and Raymond were residents of the complex, but lived in different buildings, she said.
The owner of a local coffee shop said that Raymond was a regular customer, though he asked him to leave after he began discussing the dangers of Muslim immigrants.
Investigators have not established a relationship between the accused and the deceased, said Fredericton deputy police chief Martin Gaudet.
“That is a piece of information we’re looking to establish, and we haven’t established it yet,” he said at a news conference outside police headquarters, where residents have placed flowers, notes and teddy bears for the fallen officers.

While little is known about the alleged gunman’s potential motives, police have begun piecing together what happened.

Investigators allege a man shot at Wright and Robichaud from an elevated position shortly after 7 a.m. Friday, using a long gun. They said Costello and Burns were responding to the shooting and found two victims on the ground, a man and woman. That’s when the officers were shot, police said.
Officials said Saturday that just one person was hospitalized after the shooting – Raymond, who is being treated for serious injuries after being shot by police.
He is to remain in custody until he appears in court Aug. 27, police said.
In an interview, Aguilar said that at one point maintenance workers needed to do some repairs in his apartment and he didn’t want them there while he wasn’t present.

“He seemed concerned, he said he had an expensive computer and an expensive bike and he didn’t want anyone to be there alone,” she said. “They didn’t even have to go all the way into the apartment, they were just fixing his door frame at the time.”
She said she didn’t interact with Robichaud much because he didn’t come into the office to make his rent payments, and she did not know if he knew Raymond.
As of Saturday morning, the area surrounding the crime scene remained cordoned off by yellow tape, but police allowed some shaken residents through to check on their pets.
An RCMP forensic unit was on scene and police could be seen moving through the complex of low-rise brick apartments.
More than half a dozen bullet holes could be seen in the window of an upper-floor corner apartment, while a second window appeared to have been mostly smashed.
Joe Cartwright emerged from the building to say all the doors in the complex had been kicked in and one of his cats had escaped.
Cartwright said his girlfriend, Caitlyn Francis, and four-year-old son had been at home during the shooting, and he rushed to the scene in a panic once he realized his family could be in danger.

“I’m very torn up,” he said. “I’m not doing very well at all, my girlfriend’s not, my son’s not, so we’re going to go and just try to calm down from this.”

Francis said she had been getting her stepson ready for daycare at 7:10 a.m. when she heard police sirens.
She looked out and saw a police car pull in, driven by a man she believes was Costello.
“Not even a minute or two later I heard the first gunshot,” she said Saturday morning, as she stood wrapped in a Red Cross blanket outside the apartment complex.
“I started bolting into my apartment and heard a second one.”

“There was no playing off what those sounds were, he knew it.”
Five minutes after the gunfire ceased, she said she peeked out the window and saw the leg of a person who was lying on the ground.
Police have asked anyone who captured photos or video of the incident to come forward.

Fredericton police said Friday night that the city and Red Cross had found lodging for 50 residents unable to return to their homes on Brookside Drive on the city’s north side.
At least 10 children lost a parent in the shooting.
Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children.
On Saturday evening, the Fredericton police released statements from both officers’ families.

“Sara absolutely loved her job, and went to work each shift committed to serving this great community. We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,” the statement said.
Costello’s partner, Jackie McLean, said in a statement of behalf of the family that she also sought privacy, but wanted to say a few things about him.
“Robb was the single most positive person I have ever met; and that was obvious to everyone who met him. He had a special way of dealing with people – fair, but strong and tough when needed. He was the only officer I’ve ever known to write a ticket and have the recipient thank him for it,” she said. Tweet This
“He was often heard to say he was a ‘CFL’ – constable for life. He loved the people, he loved the variety of calls, but mostly he loved being able to de-escalate an escalating situation. I know he responded eagerly and willingly to that last call.”
Robichaud, a father of three who played bass and sang in a few local bands, had just begun dating Wright.
“It is just unfair, cruel and senseless. I have a lot of mixed emotions right now. I just pray to God that justice is served in this situation,” said Amanda Lee Leighton, 32, of Fredericton, a close friend of Wright.

<https://gravismarketing.com/minnesota-poll-results/> dct:description """n 2016 as Donald Trump was winning the presidential race by flipping multiple states in the Midwest, Hillary Clinton was able to hold on by 1.5 points in the state of Minnesota. The last Republican presidential nominee to carry the state was Richard Nixon in 1972 and the last Republican to win any statewide office in Minnesota was Tim Pawlenty in 2006. A new Gravis Marketing poll of the state indicates that the state is poised to continue those trends. In the poll, former Vice President Joe Biden leads incumbent President Donald Trump by a 14-point margin, 53%-39% with 8% undecided. Biden’s strength in the state is due to a 53%-40% lead among white voters and 61%-37% among those over the age of 65. The gender gap is also significant with Biden only winning men by 5 points, but winning women by 22 points. Notably, there are only 3% of women undecided while 13% of men in this poll indicate that they are undecided.
In the race for Senate, incumbent Senator Tina Smith holds the same 53%-39% 14-point lead over former Congressman Jason Lewis. Smith’s coalition is similar to Biden’s in that she is carrying white voters by 15 points and voters over 65 by 25 points. She holds a 4-point edge among men and a 24-point lead among women.
43% of Minnesota likely voters indicate that they approve of the job the President has done while 54% disapprove. Joe Biden is seen in a broadly positive light with 60% having a favorable view of him (35% very favorable) and 37% have an unfavorable view (34% very unfavorable) of the former Vice President.
This poll was conducted by Gravis Marketing, a nonpartisan research and data firm. This poll of 657 registered, likely voters in Minnesota was conducted from October 24th through the 26th and has a margin of error of ±3.8%. This survey was conducted using interactive voice responses and an online panel of cell phone users. This poll was not commissioned by any campaign committee or other organization and was paid for by Gravis Marketing. Results are weighted by voting demographics. Questions can be directed to the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan.

DES MOINES — Today, the Iowa Democratic Party announced the results of the State Convention, including the 54 members of Iowa’s delegation to the Democratic National Convention. 1,781 Iowa Democrats voted in the State Convention, which was conducted through online forms and mail-in ballots to protect public health during the global pandemic. The State Convention Rules Committee approved the results of the Convention elections today.
From May 25-30, elections were held in 4 District Conventions for 27 district delegates and 4 alternate delegate spots. Balloting for the State Convention ran from June 3-10 to elect 9 at-large delegates, 1 at-large alternative, and 5 PLEOs (Party Leaders and Elected Officials) in addition to the 8 automatic delegates. The Presidential delegation breakdown is: 20 Biden, 12 Buttigieg, 1 Klobuchar, 9 Sanders, and 5 Warren. Iowa’s national delegation will be represented by 26 women, 25 men, and 3 non-binary delegates. The full list of delegates can be found at: theconventions.org.
“Iowa Democrats have a chance to change the direction of our state at every level, and we’re not taking our foot off the gas,” said IDP Chair Mark Smith. “Our caucus and conventions have been incredible examples of dedicated, grassroots organizing work of thousands of Iowans who have participated in this process. Although we weren’t able to gather in person to celebrate our newly-nominated candidates, safety is our highest priority as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve got an incredibly strong slate of candidates who are using creative ways to reach voters and turn primary election momentum into wins up-and-down the ticket in November. I’m proud to lead this team of dedicated Iowa Democrats and elected officials as we join our fellow democrats from across the country to nominate our next president.”
In April, the party announced that it would conduct the entire 2020 convention through online forms and mail-in ballots to keep Iowans safe during the global pandemic. The updated process was based on conversations with County Chairs, the State Central Committee and party leaders. The changes to the Delegate Selection Plan were approved unanimously by the State Central Committee in April to fulfill the party’s overall goal of electing democrats up-and-down the ticket while protecting public health.

<https://iwpr.net/global-voices/armenia-murder-case-strains-relations-moscow> dct:description """Armenians in the capital Yerevan and the northwestern city of Gyumri have reacted angrily after the national authorities failed to act against a Russian serviceman accused of carrying out a brutal gun massacre.
Instead, the suspect, Private Valery Permyakov, was taken into custody at the Russian army base where he was deployed, and the military authorities there are now investigating the crime.
The Armenian authorities’ reluctance to investigate themselves and put the suspect on trial in a domestic court has been criticised by the national ombudsman and has led to public protests in Yerevan and in Gyumri, where the attack took place.
According to Armenia’s Investigative Committee, Private Permyakov, a Russian soldier deployed at the 102nd Russian base in Gyumri, has pleaded guilty to killing seven members of a single family in an attack on January 12. His victims included a two-year-old girl and a six-month old boy; the latter initally survived but died from his injuries in hospital on January 19.
Police found an AK-74 rifle along with 21 cartridges at the crime scene. They also found a pair of soldiers’ boots marked with Permyakov’s name.
According to Raffi Aslanian, prosecutor for the Shirak region where Gyumri is located, Russian border guards detained Permyakov on January 12 as he tried to cross the border into Turkey, about 15 kilometres away from Gyumri. The suspect was then handed over to the Russian military authorities at the base, where he is in custody.
The move has caused serious discontent among Armenians, particularly in Gyumri, as people feel the Russians behaved in a high-handed manner, and Permyakov should instead have been prosecuted under domestic law since he was off the base.
Some argue that allowing him to be handed over to Russian custody was a breach of Armenian law and also of a bilateral arrangement between the two countries. The border with Turkey is manned by border guards from both Armenia and Russia. However, under a 1992 agreement, suspected criminals picked up at the border should be handed to Armenian law enforcement agencies.
There was therefore some surprise when a statement issued by the prosecutor general's office on January 13 said that the authorities had not discussed investigating Permyakov under Armenian law. The statement said the reason was that the suspect was "a citizen of the Russian Federation and under the jurisdiction of Russian law enforcement agencies”. It cited article 61, paragraph 1 of the Russian constitution which prohibits the extradition of Russian nationals to other states.
Lawyers in Armenia, as well as the country’s ombudsman Karen Andreasyan, have criticised the national authorities and say there are no legal grounds for the Russian military to take custody of Permyakov and investigate the case.
"The fact that the murder was committed on Armenian territory and the victims of the crime were Armenian gives grounds to say that under international law, under the Armenian-Russian intergovernmental agreement, and under the constitution and legislation of Armenia, the investigation of the case should be conducted by the law enforcement and judicial authorities of Armenia,” Andreasyan said. “The suspect must be handed over to the Armenian authorities.”
Vahagn Dallakyan, a lawyer who works for the Yerevan Investment Law Group, highlighted a 1997 agreement governing the Russian military base in Gyumri. "Article 4 clearly states that the investigation of crimes committed by persons who are members of the Russian military base in Armenia falls under the jurisdiction of Armenia’s law enforcement agencies and under Armenian legislation," he said.
The Armenian authorities’ handling of the case has led to demonstrations in Gyumri and Yerevan on January 14 and 15. About 30 protesters and police were taken to hospital following clashes. Police also had to deploy in large numbers at the military base and at Moscow’s consulate in Gyumri and embassy in Yerevan.
Armenia’s prosecutor general, Gevorg Kostanyan, rushed to Gyumri to meet the protesters. As demonstrators hurled coins, Kostanyan promised them that he would appeal to Russia’s chief prosecutor to get the case and the suspect himself transferred to Armenian jurisdiction.
Besides the issue of whether Armenia or Russia should investigate and prosecute the case, there are also concerns about local efforts to pursue the suspect immediately after the crime took place.
A photograph of Permyakov published by the media the same morning quickly circulated online. Yet despite a large-scale manhunt mounted by Armenian police and security services, he managed to elude them for about 12 hours. In doing so he walked about 15 kilometres in freezing temperatures of minus 14 degrees. The Armenian authorities have yet to comment on how he did this.
More broadly, many Armenians feel the incident showed that the national authorities were being dictated to by Moscow and, as such, marks a shift in the former Soviet state’s relationship with Russia.
The chairman of the Helsinki Committee of Armenia, Avetik Ishkhanyan, disputes the official account of events in Gyumri. He believes Permyakov may have been picked up by the Armenian police and then handed over to Russian forces.
"I don’t trust the official statement, so it is even possible that the Armenians arrested him and handed him over to his Russian base," Ishkhanyan said.
Ishkhanyan noted that Russia’s deputy defence minister, Arkady Bakhin, visited Armenia on January 13, the day after the incident. He sees this as an attempt to put pressure on Yerevan.
Russia is a longstanding ally of Armenia, supplying most of its gas as well as maintaining a military presence there. Given the traditionally cordial relationship, one might have expected the Permyakov incident to have been resolved amicably. But a number of factors have soured perceptions of Russia. Many Armenians were outraged when it emerged in 2013-14 that the Russian arms industry was selling tanks and other hi-tech military equipment to Azerbaijan, a country with which they are still technically at war, even though the Nagorny Karabakh conflict ended in a truce 20 years ago. (See Yerevan Angry at Russian Arms Sales to Baku.)
Then there is the change in Russia’s own circumstances. Armenia entered the Russia-Belarus-Kazakstan Eurasian Economic Union at the beginning of January, but much of its trade is with European states and it has no wish to share in Moscow’s increasing isolation, a result of its actions in Ukraine. The deepening economic crisis in Russia has also had a direct impact on the large numbers of Armenians working there, cutting the value of the money they send home and reducing the numbers of jobs on offer to foreign migrants. (See Armenian Economy Hit by Knock-on Effects of Russia Sanctions.)
Ruben Mehrabyan, an expert at the Armenian Centre for Political and International Studies, is concerned that Yerevan has acquiesced to Moscow over the incident. He points out that President Serzh Sargsyan did not declare an official day of mourning, and waited a whole week to offer his condolences to the victims’ relatives – after Russian president Vladimir Putin had done so.
"Armenia has become hostage to Russia," Mehrabyan said. "In the short term, what happened may not affect Armenian-Russian relations, but looking at it in the long term, it marks the beginning of a process of reviewing the relationship.
“We are not a province of Russia, but the current Russian elite does not understand that."

The 2013 Electric Daisy Carnival at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in June is estimated to have brought in more than $278 million to the Clark County economy, according to an economic impact report commissioned by festival producers Insomniac.
The study, released today by Beacon Economics LLC, marks a 34 percent increase from the estimated $207 million generated by the 2012 festival. Since relocating from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in 2011, the dance music festival is estimated to have injected more than $621 million into the local economy.
According to the report, the three-day festival produced an estimated $17.4 million in tax revenue for state and local government, with an overall economic output equivalent to 2,686 full-time jobs and a labor income increase of $113.8 million for employees in Clark County.
“Each year our goal with EDC Las Vegas is to improve the fan experience, and I’m so happy that, as we continue to improve and grow, Clark County continues to benefit, too,” Pasquale Rotella, founder and CEO of Insomniac, said in a news release. “The Insomniac family and our fans have truly embraced Las Vegas as our home during EDC Week in the city, and the idea that the fans get to have fun while also creating hundreds of millions of dollars for the local economy is truly a win-win situation. We’re already looking forward to returning in 2014.”
Data for the study were compiled using statistics and a survey of nearly 12,000 attendees provided by Insomniac.
The sold-out event drew approximately 345,000 attendees over the course of its three days in June, up from 320,000 the previous year, with thousands more attending Insomniac-sponsored EDC Week nightclub and dayclub events and the EDMbiz industry conference in the week surrounding Electric Daisy Carnival. Ninety-five percent of attendees traveled from outside the Las Vegas area, hailing from 50 states and 46 countries.
The festival generated an estimated $136.9 million in visitor spending — a 38 percent increase over 2012 — including $25 million on accommodations, $22.1 million on transportation, $45 million on dining, $19.6 million on gaming, $13.1 million on entertainment and $11.8 million on retail.
"Again in 2013, EDC continued to grow in attendance and its impact on Las Vegas," said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events. "The EDC experience has proven to be a huge success, and we look forward to working with Insomniac in 2014 and beyond."
Nearly 82 percent of fans surveyed indicated that they would return for next year’s event, which takes place from June 20-22 at LVMS. EDC Week also returns, from June 17-23, and also will include a new dance music awards show in collaboration with Dick Clark Productions. Tickets for the 18th Annual Electric Daisy Carnival are on sale and $249 for a three-day, general-admission pass and $499 for VIP.

<https://lfpress.com/news/london/2009/12/19/12214646.html> dct:description """This is the year we skipped Christmas and went to straight to Boxing Day.
At least it looked that way at London area malls over the weekend as most large retail chains slashed prices on many items anywhere from 30-80% with Christmas still several days away.
Ken Hardy, a marketing professor at the Richard Ivey School of Business said pre-Christmas discounts have been around for a few years, but this year even high-end retailers have joined in and the discounts seem to be much deeper.
He said retailers are also keeping lean inventories and are discounting early to make sure they hit their year-end sales targets.
"It's a funny, unpredictable year. We don't know if shoppers are just waiting or buying less. Everybody wants to strike while the iron is hot," said Hardy.
He said all the deep discounts may have an impact on the bottom line, but retailers aren't confident they can move merchandise without them.
In their latest report the Retail Council of Canada warned retailers are facing "a complex market environment in which the consumer is sending mixed signals."
The report said customers "have not executed a broad retreat but rather are exercising the famous Canadian prudence and caution"
The weekend saw the usual rush at the White Oaks Mall as cars circled like birds of prey waiting for the parking spots to open up.
But the top deck of the mall's often-overlooked parking garage was almost empty even in the middle of the afternoon crush.
There were plenty of shoppers but not much information on how much they were buying. Corporate rules prevent the managers of most chain retail stores from speaking to the media.
Will and Tara Beardmore of Dorchester had almost finished their Christmas shopping and had taken their son Jacob to see Santa.
"The sales make it a little easier on the pocketbook. The stores must be a little worried," said Tara.
The couple said the stores weren't quite as busy as they expected
"It's been a tough year for a lot of people," said Will.
Hardy said this might be the last lean Christmas for retailers if the economy continues to improve.
But he said pre-Christmas discounts appear to be changing the traditional rules of holiday season shopping.
"The people who are waiting for an even better deal on Boxing Day may be disappointed."
Hardy said London area retailers could at least be thankful they missed the winter storm that socked the northeastern United States on the weekend.
The storm left stores almost deserted on a crucial weekend for hard-pressed US retailers.
"For them to lose a day now, it's like losing a month any other time of year," said Hardy.

<https://massispost.com/2015/04/austrian-parliament-recognizes-armenian-genocide/> dct:description """VIENNA — Austria became on Wednesday the latest country to recognize the 1915 Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey, a First World War-era ally of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
The Austrian parliament approved a corresponding statement drafted by the parliamentary leaders of the country’s six main political parties after observing a minute of silence for up to 1.5 million Armenians massacred by the Ottoman Turks.
“April 24, 1915 marked the beginning of a policy of deportation and persecution, which ended in genocide,” parliament speaker Doris Bures said at a special session dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the tragedy.
The parliamentary faction leaders stressed the importance of recognizing the Armenian massacres as genocide in their ensuing speeches delivered at the National Council.
The declaration authored by them reads, “Due to a historical responsibility — the Austro-Hungarian Empire was allied with the Ottoman Empire in the First World War — it is our duty to recognize the terrible events as genocide and condemn them.”
“It is also Turkey’s duty to face the dark and painful chapter of its past and recognize the crimes committed against Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as genocide,” it says, echoing a resolution adopted by the European Parliament last week.
The statement also mentions hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Assyrians who were murdered on Ottoman government orders a century ago.
Armenia, whose ambassador in Vienna was present at the parliament session, was quick to welcome the declaration coming just two days before official ceremonies in Yerevan that will mark the centenary of the genocide. “With this step Austria has made an important contribution to the noble task of preventing genocides and other crimes against humanity,” Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian said in a statement.
Turkey did not immediately react to the Austrian move. Ankara last week strongly condemned Pope Francis and the European Parliament for using the word genocide to honor the Armenians slaughtered during the First Word War.
Incidentally, the Austrian declaration cited and endorsed the statements made by Francis and the European Union’s legislative body.""" ;

We missed it because we weren’t looking
By David Burrell | CEO & Co-Founder of Wick
Wick is not a polling company for either political party. We exist to create technology and thought leadership that accelerates the market research industry’s journey to more speed, affordability, and accuracy. We withheld this article until the day before the election to limit the politicization of its data and insights for the media interests of either party.
For media inquiries please email us at info@wick.io
From the author:
We are predicting that Donald Trump is going to win re-election. In our most recent battleground polls in the 6 states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, and Ohio he is up by over 2% in all but Michigan (for those results scroll to the end of this article).
But, what’s more interesting than our prediction, is that until last week, our polls showed Trump losing by margins similar to what you have probably seen in the news.
What caused this change in results? It had little to do with either team’s campaigning or voters changing their opinions. We can still easily conduct a poll that has Biden up by a large margin. The change in our results was due to a change in methodology.
Born from curiosity, we believe we identified large opportunities to understand and adjust for to strengthen our predictions. We started with a data collection plan similar to the one we and many pollsters have been using for years. One that has largely been accurate. But in these unprecented times, we assumed the standard data collection playbook would not be good enough to achieve the right breakdowns of the variables neccesary for accuracy (such as age, race, gender, etc…) Instead, we assumed that the sample was not going to be representative of turnout, taking a much more granular approach. We stepped outside the tradional polling swimlanes and put every segment under a microscope. As the data came in, we examined each segment for symptoms of over or under representation . When we found a symptom we would treat for it (if possible) by adjusting our data sample and our screening to ensure the right people were taking our surveys (as opposed to applying, what would have been, huge weights on the backend). More on the methodology later, but first I’ll touch on why we thought to do this study in the first place. This will inform the lens through which we were closely inspecting the responses.
So, what made us do this? It was a number of things - our team has been involved in elections for 12 years, touched thousands of polls, built a company that created an opinion research technology; used by dozens of companies. We’ve seen a lot of data along the way… and something didn’t look or feel right this time. The final nudge to act on this feeling came a week or so ago as I was watching a Biden speech on TV and I couldn’t hear him over the sound of Trump supporters honking their horns. I joked that we needed to tally the honks, because out of the hundreds of polls I’ve run this year, this is the first I have heard from this group of voters… Maybe this is 2020’s “hard to reach segment” voicing their opinion.
It was a joke, but it made me start to wonder how much truth there was to it, so we decided to dig deeper and find out. What follows (in addition to the results of the polls shown further down) is our best shot at explaining what we saw when we checked our premises, and why 2020's polls may have been misleading Americans for months.""" ;

<https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035661> dct:description """The assault on the villages of Ogossagou and Welingara, populated with people from the Peulh – or Fulani – ethnic group took place on Saturday 23 March. In addition to the killings, at least 70 were injured, allegedly by members of the Dogon ethnic group. It was the fourth major attack since the start of the year against villages populated by Peulhs/Fulanis. On 1 January, in Kolougon, at least 37 women, children and men were killed during the day.
The UN independent human rights expert mandated with monitoring the situation in Mali, Alioune Tine, said in a statement that he also received reports that, on 26 March, suspected Fulani armed elements two Dogon hamlets, Ouadou and Kere Kere, killing at least six people, abducting about 20 people, and burning several homes.
Mr. Tine noted that since January 2019 there had been reports of at least 22 incidents of human rights violations by community-based self-defense groups, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 230 people.
The UN prevention of genocide office confirmed “a serious upsurge in inter-communal violence as well as negative impact of counter-terrorism operations conducted by community-based armed groups on the civilian populations in the region”.
The office further noted that “there is growing ethnicization of the conflict in central Mali, in which entire communities are being stigmatized as terrorists or as affiliates of armed groups”.
The community-based armed groups and other armed actors have been carrying out targeted attacks against civilians in the context of the fight against terrorism, committing “serious violations and abuses of human rights including killings, destruction of property, arbitrary detention and de facto embargos on villages, restricting movement of civilian populations,” the UN genocide prevention office stated.
The statement deplored that these developments and dynamics are “not sufficiently recognized neither by national authorities nor by the international community, who are focusing mostly on the peace process in the North and on the threat posed by jihadist movements”.
“Over the recent months, violence has reached unprecedented level amid retaliatory attacks and serious violations of human rights in central Mali impacting on all communities,” Special Advisor Dieng said. “Unless these concerns are immediately addressed, there is a high risk of further escalation of the situation in which atrocity crimes could be committed,” he warned.
To prevent further escalation of violence, Mr. Dieng urged the Malian Government – with the support of the international community, and the UN peacekeeping mission in the country, MINUSMA – to immediately address the current grave upsurge of violence in central Mali and to provide, with no further delay, protection as well as assistance to vulnerable population.
“I call on the Malian government to urgently investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the recent attacks as well as those responsible for serious violations and abuses of human rights.” he said, adding that the authorities and all Malians should “prevent and refrain from stigmatizing entire communities”.
The UN office on the prevention of genocide said it stands ready to provide support to local reconciliation and inter-communal dialogue processes, with the aim of promoting inclusivity, strengthening resilience and social cohesion.
Human rights expert Alioune Tine also called for “a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. The protection of lives and the well-being of civilians is at stake.”
“It is crucial that these inter-communal tensions, and this cycle of violence, are addressed urgently if the risk of crimes against humanity is to be averted,” he insisted.""" ;

<https://news.yahoo.com/u-navy-petty-officer-dies-wounding-tennessee-attack-130542080.html> dct:description "By Richard Valdmanis CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (Reuters) - Hours before the Tennessee shooting that killed five U.S. servicemen, the suspected gunman texted his close friend a link to a long Islamic verse that included the line: \"Whosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, then I have declared war against him.\" His friend thought nothing of it at the time, but now wonders if it was a clue to Thursday's rampage in Chattanooga, which has re-ignited concerns about the radicalization of young Muslim men. \"I didn't see it as a hint at the time, but it may have been his way of telling me something,\" the friend told Reuters on Saturday. He requested anonymity for fear of a backlash. The suspect, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, a 24-year-old Kuwaiti-born naturalized U.S. citizen, was killed in a gunfight with police. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism, but said it was premature to speculate on the gunman's motive. While a firm connection between the suspect and radical Islam has not been established, the shooting follows a series of attacks or thwarted attacks in the United States and other countries by Muslims claiming to be inspired by Islamic State or other militant groups. Abdulazeez's friends said he had returned from a trip to Jordan in 2014 concerned about conflicts in the Middle East and the reluctance of the United States and other countries to intervene. He later purchased three assault rifles on an online marketplace and used them for target practice, the friends said. \"That trip was eye-opening for him. He learned a lot about the traditions and culture of the Middle East,\" said the close friend who received the text message. Abdulazeez was upset about the 2014 Israeli bombing campaign in Gaza and the civil war in Syria, he said. \"He felt Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia were not doing enough to help, and that they were heavily influenced by the United States.\" Another friend said, \"He had always talked about it, but I'd say his level of understanding and awareness really rose after he came back.\" U.S. authorities said Abdulazeez sprayed gunfire at a joint military recruiting center in a strip mall in Chattanooga, then drove to a Naval Reserve Center about 6 miles (10 km) away, where he killed four Marines before he himself was shot dead. Three other people were injured, including a U.S. Navy petty officer who died from his wounds on Saturday. The Navy did not give the name of the sailor, but his step-grandmother identified him as Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith of Paulding, Ohio, who left behind a wife and three young daughters. \"He was an awesome young man,\" Darlene Proxmire told Reuters. \"He loved his wife and children. He loved the Navy.\" JORDAN TRIP WAS \"EYE-OPENING\" Abdulazeez, an engineer, went to the Middle East in 2010 and visited several countries, according to his close friend. He then went to Jordan in 2014 to work for his uncle, and lived with his uncle and his grandparents there, he said. After Abdulazeez returned, he seemed more mellow, less interested in partying. \"That is part of what drew us closer. He was a guy who wanted to settle down and get his life going. That connected us,\" he said. The night before the attack, just after 10 p.m., the close friend received a text from Abdulazeez with a link to a Hadith, or Islamic teaching: http://sunnah.com/nawawi40/38. The friend said he had been asking Abdulazeez for job advice, and continued to text him that evening and into Thursday but did not get a reply. The friend said he was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI declined to comment on Saturday. For jihadists and ultraconservative Salafist Sunni Muslims, the Hadith \"is usually understood within the context of al-wala wa-l-bara (or) love for Islam and hatred for its enemies,\" said David Cook, an associate professor who specializes in Islam in the department of religion at Rice University in Texas. According to Abdulazeez's friends, he had purchased three guns on armslist.com after returning from Jordan, including an AK-74, an AR-15, and a Saiga 12. They said he also owned a 9mm and a .22 caliber hand guns. Armslist.com is an online listing site on which individuals can buy and sell firearms through private transactions. Critics say it enables people to obtain weapons without background checks, though the site has a disclaimer that it requires users to agree to follow all state and federal firearms laws. Emails seeking comment from Armlist.com and Armslist Legal Defense Fund, created to defend Armslist against lawsuits, were not immediately answered. GUNS, FAST CARS Abdulazeez had occasionally smoked marijuana and drank alcohol, and struggled to reconcile that with his faith in Islam, his friends said. At one point, in 2012 or 2013, Abdulazeez received therapy for his drugs and alcohol use, they said. \"He used it to de-stress, when things were difficult at home, or whatever,\" the close friend said, adding that tensions between Abdulazeez and his Palestinian parents had upset him. His parents nearly got divorced in 2009, according to court records. In April, Abdulazeez was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. He was facing a July 30 court date for his DUI charge. Abdulazeez also had problems with local youths that sometimes took on a religious and racial tone, his friend said. \"There were rednecks, ignorant people, who sometimes would cause problems. Mo never fought, but he used to get worked up and yell and stuff,\" he said. \"Afterwards he would calm down, and just say it doesn't matter.\" Over the past few months, Abdulazeez and his friends practiced shooting in the Prentice Cooper state forest near Chattanooga, sometimes two or three times a week. \"He was always interested in guns, since he was young. He started with a BB gun and paintball, and went on from there. We would go out shooting quite often,\" said the close friend. Abdulazeez also liked driving fast in the hills surrounding Chattanooga. Two nights before the attack, he and some friends went joyriding in Abdulazeez's rented gray convertible Ford Mustang, passing through the towns of Whitwell, Dayton and Jasper. \"Fast car on a rainy night. We were flying, doing tight turns and drifting,\" said the friend, adding that they returned home at about 3 o'clock in the morning. \"He seemed totally normal. We made plans to hang out on the weekend,\" he said. He said Abdulazeez had a good paying job and many plans for his life, including possibly starting a computer sales business in Chattanooga. \"He wanted to buy a car. He wanted a video console, to make a man cave - every guy's dream.\" He said it was difficult to understand how his friend became the suspect in the rampage. \"The signs just weren't there,\" he said. \"The only thing I can think of is that it was a combination of things - what is happening overseas, his family problems, maybe some of the issues with the less educated people here. I don't know.\" (Additional reporting by Frank McGurty in New York, Mark Hosenball in Washington, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Tiffany Wu)" ;

<https://nypost.com/2020/03/02/florida-declares-public-health-emergency-after-two-coronavirus-cases/> dct:description """Two cases of the deadly coronavirus were identified in Florida late Sunday — prompting Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a public health emergency.
The patients, both adults from the Sunshine State’s Gulf Coast, tested “presumptive positive” for COVID-19, Florida health officials said.
That means the cases were confirmed by a public health laboratory, but are awaiting confirmatory testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The first patient, from Manatee County, had no history of travel to a country identified for restricted travel by the CDC, a list that includes China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan.
The other patient, a resident of Hillsborough County, has traveled to Italy, though health officials didn’t say when.
Both “are isolated and being appropriately cared for,” the state health department said.
Shortly after the announcement, DeSantis issued an executive order declaring a public health emergency, releasing resources to tackle the virus.
He said he’ll be in Tampa and Miami on Monday to speak with the state surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees, about the response to the outbreak.
The announcement of the Florida cases came after New York announced the first patient in the state to test positive for the flu-like illness.
Rhode Island also reported its first case Sunday.""" ;

<https://progresstexas.org/blog/new-poll-shows-biden-within-striking-distance-trump-texas-0> dct:description """Today, Progress Texas released statewide Texas voter poll results, showing Democrats are within striking distance in both the Presidential and U.S. Senate races in Texas.
What does this mean? Texas voters are fed up with Texas Republicans’ lack of action on the COVID-19 health care crisis, mass unemployment, and systemic racism that communities face every day. Now is the time to organize, continue to rally for change, and vote.
Key takeaways
Joe Biden comes within 2 points of Donald Trump with 46%.
In the poll, Texas voters were asked who they would vote for in the Presidential race this fall. Joe Biden came within the margin of error against Donald Trump with 46/48, respectively. A small percentage of voters (6%) were unsure.
45% of Texas voters would vote for the Democratic candidate in the U.S. Senate election.
The generic ballot for the U.S. Senate race (if a Texas voter were to vote today) is Republican 47% and Democratic 45%, also within the poll’s margin of error, and supports previous polls showing that a majority of Texans either don’t know or don’t like Republican John Cornyn.
As an additional frame of reference, then-Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke was polling 5 points behind in June of 2018 and went on to lose by 2 points. Texas Democrats are currently ahead of their 2018 pace.
Only 48% of Texas voters approve of Donald Trump’s job performance.
Donald Trump’s approval/disapproval rating amongst polled Texas voters is 48/46. Nationally, a slim percentage of Americans approve of Trump amidst his responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. His approval nationally now stands at 41%, similar to the 39% approval rating he received the last time the question was asked in a poll two weeks ago.
Methodology: The Progress Texas/PPP survey of 907 Texas voters was conducted by Public Policy Polling from Thursday, June 18, 2020 to Friday, June 19, 2020 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points. The method of conducting the poll was 50% by phone call and 50% by text message.

<https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/latest-georgia-and-minnesota-voting-intention-12-17-september/> dct:description """In addition to Redfield & Wilton Strategies’ summer polling across six key swing states (Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), this week our state-by-state polling was extended to Minnesota and Georgia. These two states could also be key in the 2020 Presidential Election and the battle for control of the Senate as they are showing signs of a potential flip. Hillary Clinton won Minnesota by 1.5% in 2016, yet Republicans are seeing an opportunity to re-take the state by pushing a law and order message and Trump himself has viewed the state as a target for over a year. Although President Trump won Georgia by a margin of more than 5% four years ago, Democrats believe that Stacey Abrams’ narrow loss in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race highlights the party’s progress there.
At this stage, Joe Biden currently leads Donald Trump by 9% in Minnesota with a majority (51%) of Minnesotans saying that they will vote for the former Vice President, while 42% say they will vote to re-elect President Trump. Only 5% do not know who they will vote for. In Georgia, the candidates are currently neck and neck with Donald Trump leading Joe Biden by just 1%, a gap which falls well within the margin of error of this poll. Currently, 46% of respondents in Georgia say they are going to vote for the incumbent President, while 45% think they will vote for Joe Biden. 6% of Georgia respondents don’t know who they are going to vote for.
With slightly different policies between the two states around absentee, early, and in person early voting, the methods by which respondents plan to vote varies between the two states. A clear plurality (47%) of respondents in Minnesota intend to vote in person on election day, compared to around a third (32%) in Georgia. 31% of the Georgian public intend to vote in person prior to election day, compared to just 11% in Minnesota. Mail-in voting remains a popular option in both states, with 35% of Minnesotans and 30% of Georgians saying they will vote absentee.
As we have highlighted in our previous research, some have speculated that the result of the election may be disputed due to issues with mail-in votes. The particularly close results from our poll in Georgia this week suggest that the outcome of the election in the Peach State could be contentious come November, as it was in the 2018 Gubernatorial election, especially given that Biden has a clear advantage throughout the country among mail-in voters.
Enthusiasm Gap
Across our national and swing state polling, research has consistently indicated that likely Trump voters are significantly more enthusiastic about voting for Trump than likely Biden voters are about casting their ballot for Biden. Across Minnesota and Georgia, between 42-43% of likely Biden voters are ‘very enthusiastic’ about voting for Biden, whereas a clear majority (55-58%) of likely Trump voters are ‘very enthusiastic’ about voting for the President’s re-election.
Key Issues
Our research highlights that the public perspective on which candidate will handle economic and healthcare issues more effectively will be central in determining the outcome of the election. In both states, a plurality (29-32%) consider that the economy is the key policy area which will determine how they vote in November, while a further fifth (18-20%) believe that healthcare is the central policy area which will impact their decision.
In Georgia, a clear plurality (45%) of respondents believe that Donald Trump is more likely to lead a strong economic recovery, rather than Joe Biden (37%). The Minnesota public however, is evenly divided, with 43% trusting Trump to lead a strong economic recovery compared to 42% trusting Biden.
The Trump campaign will also be relieved by the fact that 41% of the Georgian public trust President Trump compared to 40% who trust Biden when it comes to handling the coronavirus pandemic, although the difference lies within the margin of error of this poll. On the other hand, a clear plurality (48%) of Minnesotans believe that Joe Biden is more likely to do the most to see an end to the coronavirus pandemic, while 35% say that Trump is.
Ultimately, Trump’s relative strength on both economic and healthcare issues in Georgia, compared to in the other six swing states, may enable him to strengthen his lead prior to Election Day and claim victory in the state once again.
Senate Races
While the 2020 election cycle has been dominated by the presidential race, there are multiple key U.S. Senate races across the country, including Georgia and Minnesota, that will be crucial in determining which party will enjoy a Senate majority for the next cycle.
In Minnesota, Democratic Senator Tina Smith is up for re-election for a full six-year term. Senator Smith was first appointed in 2018 to replace former Senator Al Franken after he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations. Smith served as replacement Senator for less than a full year before triumphing in a special senate election by 10 points, winning the rest of Franken’s term. Running against Smith this time is former house representative Jason Lewis, a right-wing radio host in Minnesota who is strongly aligned to President Trump.
Currently, 51% of Minnesota respondents say they will vote to re-elect Democratic Senator Tina Smith, while 36% will vote for Jason Lewis, her Republican opponent. Nevertheless, 11% of respondents don’t know who they will vote for, which means that Lewis may have an opportunity to narrow Smith’s lead.
Meanwhile, both Senate seats in Georgia are being contested in this election cycle. Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Senator David Perdue, who was first elected in 2014. Ossoff is running as an anti-corruption candidate and has referred to Senator Perdue as “the embodiment of a corrupt system” while Perdue’s campaign has focused on delivering aid during the coronavirus pandemic, including billions for hospitals and Congress’ creation of the small business loan Paycheck Protection Program. In parallel to the presidential contest in Georgia, the two major candidates in this Senate race are neck and neck. At this stage, Perdue and Ossoff are both polling at 43%. Moreover, 11% of respondents are yet to decide who they will vote for, which highlights that the race will be too close to call until the majority of votes are counted.
As for the second seat, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson’s retirement from the Senate last year initiated an open special election race, including multiple Democrats and Republicans. Unless a single candidate wins an outright majority, the race will go to a runoff in January. The two competitive Republicans are Kelly Loeffler, the incumbent Senator who was appointed when Isakson stepped down for health reasons, and Doug Collins, a pastor. For the Democrats, Matt Lieberman and Raphael Warnock are the key candidates. Lieberman is the son of former vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, while Warnock was the pastor of the late Congressman John Lewis.
Currently, a slight plurality (26%) say they will vote to re-elect Republican Senator Loeffler in the Special Senate Election, while around a fifth (21%) intend to vote for Democrat Raphael Warnock. A further 19% intend to vote for Republican Doug Collins while 15% think they will cast their ballot for Matt Democrat Lieberman. As 15% of the electorate currently ‘don’t know’ who they will vote for, all four of these candidates have a possibility of getting into the top two for a run-off in January.
Overall, Democrats will be encouraged that the party has a solid lead in the Presidential and U.S. Senate races in Minnesota, while remaining very competitive across all races in Georgia but with many voters undecided and mail-in voting difficulties, the race is set to be very close.

Currently, 45% of respondents in Georgia say they are going to vote for Joe Biden, while 44% think they will vote for Donald Trump. While Joe Biden’s level of support has not changed from a fortnight ago, Donald Trump’s share of the vote has dropped by 2 percentage points, with undecided voters increasing by the same amount, now up to 8%.
Enthusiasm Gap
Across our national and swing state polling, research has consistently indicated that likely Donald Trump voters are significantly more enthusiastic about voting for Trump than likely Biden voters are about casting their ballot for Joe Biden. In Georgia, both candidates have seen surges in their supporters’ enthusiasm in the past fortnight, with the proportion of Donald Trump voters who are ‘very enthusiastic’ about voting for the Republican rising by four points to 65%, while 53% of Joe Biden’s supporters are now ‘very enthusiastic’, a rise of 10 points. Thus, in keeping with our findings across the nation, the ‘enthusiasm gap’ between the two candidates has narrowed from +18% in favour of Donald Trump to +12%.
Key Issues
Our research highlights that the public perspective on which candidate will handle economic and healthcare issues more effectively will be central in determining the outcome of the election. In Georgia, a plurality (31%), consider the economy to be the key policy area which will determine how they vote in November, a fall of just one point from last week. Healthcare appears to be increasingly important to voters, rising by five points to 23% as the second most key issue.
The public continues to consider that Donald Trump’s is the more likely to lead a strong economic recovery out of the coronavirus pandemic, with 44% backing the President and 39% backing Joe Biden. However, the President’s lead over his opponent on this metric has dropped slightly from +8% to +5% in the past fortnight.
Joe Biden has made gains on securing public trust in his ability to be the candidate who would do the most to see an end to the pandemic, now enjoying a +6% lead over the President, having trailed by one point a fortnight ago. At this stage, 43% back Joe Biden, while 37% back Donald Trump.
Senate Races
While the 2020 election cycle has been dominated by the presidential race, there are multiple key U.S. Senate races across the country, including in Georgia, that will be crucial in determining which party will enjoy a Senate majority for the next cycle.

While David Perdue and Jon Ossoff were neck and neck a fortnight ago, the Democrat Ossoff (47%) now enjoys a 5% lead over his Republican opponent (42%). 9% remain undecided.
As for the second seat, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson’s retirement from the Senate last year initiated an open special election race, including multiple Democrats and Republicans. Unless a single candidate wins an outright majority, the race will go to a runoff in January. The two competitive Republicans are Kelly Loeffler, the incumbent Senator who was appointed when Isakson stepped down for health reasons, and Doug Collins, a pastor. For the Democrats, Matt Lieberman and Raphael Warnock are the key candidates. Lieberman is the son of former vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, while Warnock was the pastor of the late Congressman John Lewis.
The Democrat Raphael Warnock (26%) has also made gains here, now leading by 1% despite having trailed by five points to Republican Kelly Loeffler (25%) a fortnight ago. Republican Doug Collins (16%) remains in third place, having fallen by three points, but is now tied with Democrat Matt Liberman (16%). As 14% of the electorate still ‘don’t know’ who they will vote for, all four of these candidates have a possibility of getting into the top two for a run-off in January.
Overall, Democrats will be encouraged that the Party remains very competitive across all races in Georgia, having made gains across the board in the past fortnight. With mail-in voting difficulties and many voters still undecided, the race is set to be close.

<https://researchco.ca/2020/11/02/us2020-eight-states-uspoli/> dct:description """Ohio remains too close to call, while there is little danger for the Democrats in Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey and New York.
Vancouver, BC [November 2, 2020] – Democratic nominee Joe Biden holds the upper hand over Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as American voters prepare to cast ballots in the United States presidential election, according to a series of new polls conducted by Research Co. in eight states.
The surveys of Americans who have already participated in the democratic process or plan to do so tomorrow also outline a tight race in Ohio, and give Biden the lead in Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota and New York.
Four Democrats who are seeking to retain their seats in the U.S. Senate are also ahead of their Republican rivals.
Illinois
No Republican nominee has carried the Prairie State since George H. W. Bush in 1988. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton defeated Trump in Illinois with 55% of the vote.
Biden holds a 19-point advantage over Trump among decided voters in Illinois (59% to 40%). Decided voters aged 18-to-34 prefer Biden over Trump by a 2-to-1 margin (66% to 32%).
In the election to the U.S. Senate, incumbent Democrat Dick Durbin holds a significant lead over GOP challenger Mark Curran (60% to 35%).
Michigan
Trump ended a streak of six consecutive presidential elections where the Great Lakes State was won by Democrats, defeating Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes in 2016 (47.5% to 47.3%)
Biden heads to Election Day with an eight-point advantage over the Republican incumbent in Michigan (53% to 45%). Independent decided voters in Michigan are more likely to support Biden (49%) than Trump (44%).
Incumbent U.S. Senator Gary Peters is ahead of Republican candidate John James by six points (52% to 46%).
Minnesota
The last Republican nominee to carry the North Star State was Richard Nixon in 1972. Clinton defeated Trump by 44,593 votes to secure Minnesota for the Democrats in 2016 (46.4% to 44.9%).
Biden is ahead of Trump by nine points (54% to 45%). The Democratic nominee holds a higher level of support among female decided voters (61%) than among their male counterparts (47%).
Democratic U.S. Senator Tina Smith—who won a Special Election in 2018—stands to earn a full six-year term, with a 13-point advantage over Republican candidate Jason Lewis (55% to 42%).
New Jersey
No Republican nominee has emerged victorious in the Garden State since George H. W. Bush in 1988. Four years ago, Clinton carried New Jersey with 55% of the vote.
Biden currently leads Trump by 19 points (59% to 40%) and can count on the support of 54% of decided voters who identify as Independent.
In the race for the U.S. Senate seat, incumbent Democrat Cory Booker is ahead of Republican rival Rik Mehta by 26 points (62% to 36%).
New York
In the last 10 presidential elections, only Ronald Reagan has been able to carry the Empire State for the Republican Party in 1980 and 1984. In 2016, Clinton won New York with 59% of the vote.
Biden is ahead of Trump by a sizeable margin (64% to 34%). Practically three-in-four female voters in New York (73%) will cast a ballot for Biden or have already done so.
Ohio
The Buckeye State has given its electoral votes to the winner of every presidential election held in the United States since 1964. In 2016, Trump defeated Clinton by eight points (51% to 43%)
Biden and Trump are tied among decided voters in Ohio (49% and 49%). There is a higher level of undecided voters among women (6%) than among men (2%).
Pennsylvania
In 2016, Trump became the first Republican nominee to win the Keystone State since George H. W. Bush in 1988, defeating Clinton by 44,292 votes (48.2% to 47.5%).
Biden holds a six-point edge over Trump in Pennsylvania (52% to 46%). More than half of men (54%) and decided voters aged 35-to-54 (52%) intend to support the Republican nominee or have already cast a ballot for him.
Wisconsin
In 2016, Trump became the first Republican nominee to win the Badger State since Ronald Reagan in 1984, defeating Clinton by 22,748 votes 47.2% to 46.5%).
Biden is ahead of Trump by nine points in Wisconsin (54% to 45%). Support for the Democratic nominee is strongest among women (58%) and voters aged 18-to-34 (also 58%).
Methodology:
Results are based on online studies conducted on October 31 and November 1, 2020, among representative samples of 450 likely voters in eight American states: Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The data has been statistically weighted according to U.S. census figures for age and gender in each state. The margin of error—which measures sample variability—is +/- 4.6 percentage points for each state.

On the town square in front of the Boone County Courthouse, Harrison Arkansas, stands this silent witness to the 140 men, women and children from the Harrison area who were victims of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, one of the most horrific atrocities in American history.
The massacred were emigrants on their way to California who departed from Caravan Spring, about 4 miles south of Harrison, Arkansas, around May 1, 1857. They traveled by wagon train and camped at Mountain Meadows, in Utah, in the late summer. There they were attacked by Indians who were directed by Mormon settlers.
The pioneers fought and fended off the Indians for several days until both their supply of ammunition and their bodies were exhausted. Then they were approached by a band of Mormons under a banner of truce. The emigrants dropped their rifles and cheered when they saw that it was white men who were approaching.
Then the Mormon outlaws turned on them and brutally murdered 120 men, women and older children. 17 small children were later found in Mormon homes, rescued by the United States Army.
John D. Lee, a Mormon Bishop who confessed guilt, was tried, convicted and executed for his complicity in the crime in 1877.
Beneath the inscription on the monument is this quote from the Bible: "Vengence is mine, I will repay saith the lord."

<https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/austin/news/2017/05/25/residents-remember-destruction-of-jarrell-tornado> dct:description """JARRELL, Texas - It's been 20 years since Priscilla King came face-to-face with a powerful tornado.
"My only way to describe it is it was a huge vertical cloud. It didn't have a bottom," she said.
A Look Back: 20th Anniversary of Jarrell Tornado
She saw it approaching while working in a child care facility along I-35. People ran to her business, seeking refuge.
"You watch it and you know how dangerous it is, but you realize there's literally nothing you can do," she said.
Then something happened.
"This tornado came close to my gate and then it turned off to the west. So I thought, we probably had dodged a bullet, if you will," King said. "God was just with us that day."
But not everyone was so fortunate. Dozens of people lost their lives May 27th, 1997 in the Double Creek Estates and in another neighborhood west of the highway.
Among the 27 people killed was a family of five. The Igo family used to live on the property where the Jarrell Memorial Park now stands.
"Everything was just gone. Those site built homes had just been like somebody taking their hand and just completely wiped them," reminisced Williamson County Sheriff’s Commander James David. "It definitely changed a lot of lives that day."
Homes reduced to rubble, pavements ripped off the road and people were gone.
It took weeks to clean up the physical damage. Other damage takes longer to heal.
"One thing I'll never forget is the smell - just the new earth that had been turned over, the gas lines. It's hard to explain,” said David. “But still to this day, every time I get out there, I smell that smell."
The scent of a painful past that will slowly fade, but never really go away.
"The tornado doesn't define us, but it's definitely part of our history," said David.
Sheriff's officials said the tragedy changed how they respond to severe weather. Now, they move ahead of the storm by sending out warnings through reverse 911 in affected areas.
A 20th anniversary memorial service in Jarrell is planned for May 27. It’ll be at 212 N 5th Street from 3 to 4 p.m.

<https://thegrandinquirer.com/2016/03/09/scott-copeland-wins-idaho-constitution-party-primary/> dct:description """From the Idaho Constitution Party website, March 9th:
Well, it was an exciting night. It was also marred with a curious error coming out of Bingham County. Our Constitution Party candidate numbers were transposed, apparently, from the first three lines of the Republicans when the final two precincts reported from that county.
This had the effect of throwing over 130 votes to Mr. Myers incorrectly. And that, of course, could have turned the election. Upon an email notice to the Secretary of State’s overworked Elections Office late last night, regarding the obvious error, Betsie Kimbrough, State Elections Director, reviewed the Bingham results. Ms. Kimbrough deserves our compliments.
The Bingham County Clerk’s office did have the ballot numbers reported correctly on their county website. However, the data handoff up to the State somehow went awry. A correction was entered on the Unofficial Primary Night Results. And we thank Ms. Kimbrough for that due diligence.
This brings up an important note. The election reports being reported as they come in from the counties, are not yet official numbers. The report is a service, basically to news wires and interested voters. We will get Secretary Denney’s final certification on the ballots shortly. THOSE will be official.
That said, with 18 precincts yet to report, Scott Copeland held 51.7% of the Constitution Party Idaho Primary ballot. And therefore, he is the clear winner, especially since he holds the majority (versus a plurality).
To Mr. Copeland goes the state delegation’s eight (8) national delegates. Idaho’s delegation will be bound for Salt Lake City, as the Constitution Party National Convention begins April 15th, 2016 to decide the national nomination.
Mr. J.R. Myers came in second, with 28.9% of the primary ballot. Mr. Patrick Ockander placed third with 19.4%. All three candidates will be placed into nomination by the Idaho delegation at National Convention as a matter of courtesy and custom. This will ensure (assuming the Idaho nominations are properly seconded by another state’s delegation) that these candidates have podium time, as they ought.
Having invested time and treasure, the candidates should be permitted an address to the National Convention. This is generally considered as a matter of comity. We suggest that it is even a matter of strength of platform. As the platform is forged from diverse interests, it is wise to consider points of view from those candidates who have also earned significant votes from our fellow registered Constitution Party base–as have Mr. Myers and Mr. Ockander.
Anyhow, congratulations are due to all three candidates in this historical primary, and especially to Mr. Copeland the victor. It is our hope that our national party will move in the future toward the direction that CP-Idaho has trail-blazed. In order to grow and for the People to have confidence in the nomination process, that process must be opened to sunshine and water. That, after all is how a seedling grows. It is how it is nourished.
Idaho–it’s Copeland!
The results, from the Idaho Secretary of State:
Scott Copeland 250 51.7% CONSTITUTION J.R. Myers 139 28.7% CONSTITUTION Patrick Anthony Ockander 95 19.6%""" ;

<https://theravenreport.com/2016/10/31/rock-and-rolls-worst-day-this-1969-concert-ended-in-death/> dct:description """Coined by Rolling Stone magazine as “rock and roll’s all-time worst day—a day when everything went perfectly wrong,” the 1969 festival at Altamont Speedway in Northern California was a concert unlike any other. While the free event provided a chance to jam out with The Rolling Stones and some of their famous counterparts, it also gave the fans one hell of a ride. Best known for its shocking violence, destruction, and chaos, Altamont was the angry, intoxicated ruffian who stole the innocence from the summer of love.
It was supposed to be an excellent day of music and good vibes. Mick Jagger from The Rolling Stones was itching to throw a memorable show for his fans, but his manager was having trouble finding a location that would accept the scene. Altamont seemed like the perfect solution—what could be better than a concert out in the middle of nowhere? And for a bit, it seemed he was right. On the night before the concert, approximately 5,000 fans showed up to meet friends, hang by the campfire, share dope, and get psyched. Some people slept and partied in the random wrecked cars left behind from the raceway’s destruction derbies. A hired crew quickly erected the small stage and then everyone just waited for the sunrise…but no one suspected what was headed their way.
Rather than a well-planned public event, Altamont was a blueprint for disaster. With a mere four days notice, it offered a chance to see The Rolling Stones for free, one of the most popular bands of that era. The grounds for the event were chosen precisely because of their barren, treeless, and desolate location, and absolutely no warning was given to anyone living in the nearby area, including the police department. There were very few bathrooms provided and no real set up for the concert itself, just a little wooden stage in the middle of nowhere, standing maybe three feet off the ground.
Once the band started playing, they were literally surrounded on all sides by a sea of people. Lights and sound were given little attention to make the concert more “intimate,” and there was no water, food, or seating offered. And if the crowd got a little too crazy or the band felt threatened in some way? That’s easy—just hire the Hells Angels motorcycle gang to serve as security guards.
Considering it wasn’t just The Rolling Stones playing, but several other well-known bands like The Grateful Dead, Santana, and Jefferson Airplane, planners predicted around 100,000 people to show up for the free show. By 7:30 a.m. Saturday morning, however, the hills were solidly packed with people, and it was clear there had been a miscalculation. As far as the eye could see in any direction, an army of hyped up hippies could be seen advancing over the hills, through the valley, and along the road and railroad tracks, all converging on Altamont. Because the signage outside the venue was nonexistent, people became confused and just left their vehicles, sometimes hiking up to five miles through brush and stickers to find the concert. In the end, the show attracted over 300,000 people looking for one hell of a good time.
Enter the Hell’s Angels, Altamont’s “security” detail. The roar of a hundred motorcycles could be heard for several minutes before the Angels appeared on the crest of the hill and proceeded to head down into the crowd. They did not stop to chat but just drove straight through the thick mass of people, headed for the stage. Most people moved out of the way or even shouted a welcome, but the Angels were not there to be social. Bikes parked and territory secured, a couple of Angels could be seen drinking from a gallon of Red Mountain Vin Rose wine, bragging about the two tabs of mescaline they put in earlier. The Angels had been busy that morning in Berkeley, allegedly buying up thousands of tabs of sunshine acid, a variety known for being particularly speedy. Once their motors were running, drugs could be seen scattered across the stage as the Angels chugged wine and downed reds and speed. The more they partied, the more violent they became, and fighting began to break out at regular intervals.
As soon as everyone settled in and Santana began their set, things quickly turned ugly. As a young man tried to move past a few Angels to get closer to the stage, he was kicked in the face and pulverized with punches that left him motionless on the ground. In another instance, the Angels could be seen beating on a couple of naked fans, and when a photographer tried to capture the scene, they smashed his camera in his face and beat him senseless with sawed-off pool cues resembling billy clubs. As the scene grew hotter, people were ripped off the stage and hammered by several Angels at once. Reports of the spreading violence at Altamont soon made it back to the Huntington Hotel, where the Stones were getting ready to leave for the venue. They were nervous and considered canceling, but at the end of the day, the show had to go on. As their helicopter landed amidst a seething crowd miles deep, regret began to creep back in, especially when Mick Jagger exited the helicopter and was immediately punched in the face by a whacked-out fan.
The Grateful Dead were another highly anticipated show of the evening and were expected to play right before The Rolling Stones and then immediately after. Seeing how the situation was rapidly degenerating, the Dead refused to perform and left the venue, leaving the crowd even more restless and angry than they already were.
Because Mick Jagger wanted the dramatic effect of darkness when he took the stage, The Stones waited another hour or so before making their entrance. There are conflicting reports of what actually went down that fateful evening as The Rolling Stones burst into their first song of the night, “Sympathy For The Devil.” A young black concertgoer by the name of Meredith Hunter was nearing the front, and obviously very high on something, he attempted to jump up and join some of the other fans dancing on the stage. At that point, it is known he was violently pushed back by several Angels and, irritated by this treatment, shoved them back. The Angels claim he then brandished a gun at them, giving them no choice but to stab him to death. Other eyewitness accounts tell a much more horrific story of how one Angel, in particular, chased the young man through the crowd, stabbing him the back as he ran. Hunter then took out the gun in a moment of desperation to save his own life and the Angel slapped it away, stabbing Hunter in the side of the head and then kicking him over and over in the face until there was no face left.
Two witnesses to the brutalization of Hunter approached him once the Angel had left and tried to help him to safety. As they carried his bloody body through the chaotic crowd, trying to scream to the band to stop the music, they realized it was futile.
The crowd would not let them through and The Rolling Stones could not seem to hear or see them clearly, although they did shield their eyes a few times in an effort to see out into the darkness, sensing something bad was happening. Eventually, the two men carried Hunter’s body around the side of the stage and delivered him to the Red Cross tent. He died soon thereafter.
Up until then, all the hateful energy from the Angels had been focused on the troublemakers. Several stretchers were passed back through the crowd to remove those who could not longer stand, and as The Rolling Stones launched into “Under My Thumb,” a body sailed across the stage. Although Jagger had made some feeble protests up until this point, he apparently became increasingly upset and threatened to stop playing if the Angels didn’t cool off. It was a menacing moment as he stopped the music to calm down the crowd, but the Angels did nothing to help him. They’d been watching his flamboyant performance with amusement and shared disdain. They could take this guy, so who does he think he is? The Angels parked in the front of the stage gunned their engines defiantly, and then it all became perfectly clear. The musicians might be the ones playing the music, but they were most certainly not the ones in charge.
Someone had to answer for the stabbing of young Meredith Hunter. The Angel who had murdered him with thousands of witnesses was the obvious choice, and so a trial began one year after Altamont.
Despite the damning evidence and testimony, Hell’s Angel Alan Passaro walked on all charges. Most people, including the all-white jury, didn’t know much about Altamont except there had been a dustup there with some young people around Christmastime the previous year. When it came to determining guilt, perhaps it was just easier to assume a black man (and certified speed user) was the one to blame for the incident. To this day, the Hunter family has never received justice for the death of their son or an apology from The Rolling Stones, who apparently put together one of the most careless and lethal concerts in history.
And the rest is history.""" ;

<https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/edc-ny-2015-recap-dance-musics-biggest-parking-lot-rave> dct:description """When attempting examination of the EDM zeitgeist, Electric Daisy Carnival is usually a good place to start. With its marquee event, EDC Vegas, arguably the festival calendar's most centerpiece, and now for the third year running, the New Jersey-located, New York monikered, EDC New York, you'll be hard pressed to find a place with more kandi, fuzzy boots, fireworks, stimulants, and brain-pummeling dance music from all side of the genre spectrum. However, since the festival's 2014 edition, there have been a lot of changes in what defines this zeitgeist; we continue to experience fluctuations in what sounds and artists evolve and grow, begin to dissipate, and inevitably, those that simply refuse to go away (sorry, Benny Benassi). At this year's EDC NY at East Rutherford, New Jersey's MetLife stadium, May 23 and 24, we got a little taste of it all.
The festival's smaller main stage, the circuitGROUNDs, operated as a ground zero for stereotypical EDM tendencies throughout the majority of the weekend. Most in the crowd either donned some form of rave attire, or a t-shirt featuring outlandish proclamations like "Fuck Me," "I Rolled My Way Through Graduate School," or a personal favorite of the weekend—"I'm Fat, Let's Party." Musically, the stage represented an interesting mix of standard big-room and electro (Afrojack, Nicky Romero), and others, all in one of the event's most high profile spaces. Jack Beats offered some early UK bass tones after Martin Solveig performed a coupling of future-house (one of the most featured sounds of the entire weekend) and the "Hello"-esque pop fluff of his big burst of success a few years ago. Still, the most potent aspect of his repertoire is probably his new mustache.

Krewella continued in the of live performance they began at Ultra. Does anyone really care that they have a full band on a stage that is so big, DJs look like pogo-ing dots by comparison? Why was their guitarist reminiscent of the one from Mad Max: Fury Road, brashly leading a frenetic path of loudness? Anyone deserves credit for trying to offer something different in a often stale domain, but perhaps Krewella should reserve their band for concert venues, not open air festivals where the sound is already bad enough.
Other artists managed to offer mainstage sets in a manner that blurred the lines between the EDM boredom and something potentially more exciting. Brodinski played a fun rap-heavy 4PM (to a strangely motionless crowd). The Magician donned an Uncle Sam-themed blazer as he deployed feel-good house jams, including Disclosure's new club tune "Bang That," another regular throughout the weekend. Duke Dumont kept a big crowd locked in uplifting house bliss before In the final hours of the second day before Kaskade delivered a solid display of his talents, interlacing emotive big-room, thumping electro, and some anthemic breakdowns.

Over on the kineticFIELD, EDC's sensory-overloading mega-structure, which this year featured two giant (slightly terrifying) owls attached to a cathedral-esque mainframe as it had at EDC Vegas the year before, Eric Prydz put down the darkest mainstage set of the weekend while a giant technicolor octopus that eventually made its way into the crowd. During one lengthy segment in the set, he fired off rounds from his Mouseville catalogue, which led to a refreshingly weird vibe at a place where bland rage typically supplants vibes. He even dared to tease the masses with slowly unfolding progressive builds, a risky move when playing a crowd whose attention span is hedonistically finely tuned for drops. Luckily, everyone got their fix... eventually.
Instead of being inside the actual cavernous stadium, the cosmicMEADOW stage was tucked away on a far corner of the fest this year, (good call, EDC), serving as a safe zone for bass-heavy sounds over the course of two days. It also featured some of the more visibly devoted fans of the weekend, belonging to Flosstradamus and Bassnectar. DJ Josh Young acted as MC for most of the time during Floss's set, inducing turnt hysteria to the sprawling crowd below. With their warning sign imagery rotating on the giant screens like an apocalyptic monolith, the duo let loose with a medley of hip-hop remixes and unrelenting trap anthems, sending the crowd's twerk-meters to peak levels. Shortly after, long-haired wobble overlord Bassnectar was in full-form with his perfected coupling of thunderous bass loops layered over everything from slo-mo rock to full on ragga dub. The crowd was a sea of his iconic logo on posters, flags, and a whole lot of loyal bass heads.

For those thirsty for stripped-down underground sounds, the neonGARDEN tent was prime real estate. Hosted by Carl Cox on the first day, the stage was an oasis for nonstop techno pummeling with Joseph Capriati pulling a jam-packed early afternoon crowd, solidifying the Naples-based artist as one of the brightest stars in the genre. Another highlight was Dubfire, as the erstwhile Deep Disher played a standout set of maniacal rolling techno, prompting an eruption of an epic dance circle in the crowd, filled with back-flips, jackers, shufflers, and some serious techno swag. Sunday in neonGARDEN flipped the script to the more minimal, tech-house side of the seesaw, with two stunning live sets from Germany's Recondite and Lithuania's Ten Walls, who littered an eager crowd with his hotly tipped of stomping synthwork. Innervisions co-founders Âme and Dixon also held things down to much applause with some neverending basslines and seriously heady techno. At one point during Ame's set, a gang of pink-wigged clown dancers performed some synchronized, spanking, twerking, and other forms of sexually-infused movement, which was odd, but lightened the dark mood. This stage was also had the festival's greatest per capita quantity of visible inebriation. Hopefully, everyone there was drinking plenty of water too.

EDC is indeed one of the most high-profile showcases of big-name dance music and culture in the New York (even though it actually takes place in New Jersey): From the classic PLUR-centric elements of its Sin City counterpart (the merch tent actually sells PLUR flags) to its lit-up carnival rides, from giant, illuminated daisies to a Burning Man-inspired boomboxARTCAR, which featured some local talent like Brooklyn bass queens Star Eyes and Jubilee in the final hours of the weekend. EDC NY seamlessly offers a diverse, easily navigable menu of music with the to-be-expected EDM stars like Tiësto and Calvin Harris, underground kings like Carl Cox and Loco Dice, subgenre ambassadors like Yellow Claw and Gina Turner, and even drum and bass icon Andy C. Still, while it might be convenient, throwing a party in the parking lot doesn't lend itself to the most tangible of vibes. The character of the desert in its Las Vegas older sibling is mostly lost in MetLife's sprawling, kind of gross, sea of pavement.
Jake West for Insomniac
Regardless, most customers seemed satisfied and everything seemed to go smoothly over the weekend. Even being a bridge or tunnel away from the actual city, this was indeed a festival for New York's crowd, and the DJs who they love and love them back. When Tiësto briefly paused his set—momentarily pushing the excess, madness, and sensory overload to the sidelines—he took the mic to say, "New York City is the greatest city in the world," you could feel just how true it was.

Lets go back to the roots of Electric Daisy Carnival
EDC 2010, picture by RUKES.COM
The first Electric Daisy Carnival rave was held in the early 1990s at an open field in the city of Pacoima, in Los Angeles, California, by Gary Richards and DJ Steve Kool-Aid. In the early years, several Southern California venues played host to the annual electronic music festival. 2009 marked the first year that the festival occurred in Puerto Rico. In 2010, the event expanded to Dallas, Texas, and in 2011, an event in Orlando, Florida, was added.
In 2012, the EDC expanded to New York, and in 2013 expanded to Milton Keynes, UK, and Chicago. In 2011 a three-day event in Las Vegas that drew 230,000 people. In 2015 it drew more than 400,000 over 3-days (134,000 per day). Today EDC is held in California, Florida, Nevada, New Jersey, New York as well as abroad, including Mexico, the UK, Brazil, Japan and India. Electric Daily Carnival is easily one of the biggest dance music brands in the world at the moment.
The Founder – Pasquelle Rotella
Experience creator, businessman, philanthropist, film producer, night owl. Over the last 20 years, Pasquale Rotella has been known as many things. First and foremost, he is the founder and creator of the world’s largest dance music and experience company: Insomniac. He is internationally recognized as a leader in his field and a champion of electronic music culture, informed by its rich history and determined to pen the narrative to its bright future.
“Providing a memorable, one-of- a-kind experience for our fans has and always will be my first priority,” says Rotella. “We take a lot of pride in our productions, from the scenic stages and the performers to all the interactive art pieces we feature.”
Rotella earned spots on the prestigious Billboard Power 100 list in 2013, 2014, and 2015, and has been labeled by the magazine as a top “EDM Power Player” and the second most important person in EDM by Rolling Stone. He was voted the #1 Most Powerful Person in EDM by inthemix, and awarded a spot on Vegas Inc.’s “Top 40 Under 40. Insomniac Events has been featured on Fast Company’s Top Ten list of the music industry’s Most Innovative Companies, alongside Spotify and Vevo.
Electric Daily Carnival – Las Vegas
EDC moved its flagship festival to Las Vegas, Nevada in 2011 from Los Angeles. The event was held at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway from June 24 – 26. Reportedly 230,000 people had attended the 3 day festival. In 2016, Electric Daisy Carnival celebrated 20 years Under the Electric Sky. More than 134,000 fans walk through the gates of the festival each night. That’s more than 400,000 people over the course of three days. It required 100 forklifts, 70 aerial lifts, 133 light towers, 305 utility and golf carts, and more than 500 motor coaches to get the entire festival in place inside the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. That includes eight stages, 18 carnival rides, four Ferris wheels, and a staff of 5,000 people. More than 770 artists have performed at EDC. EDC draws fans from all 50 states and more than 60 countries.
Pasquale Rotella never thought EDC would be his biggest event. He always thought his first EDM festival, Nocturnal, would have a greater impact. EDC started with 5,000 people at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles back in 1997. By 2010, it was filling up the Los Angeles Coliseum and spreading out with offshoots in places like Colorado and Texas. A year later, the flagship edition would relocate from LA to Las Vegas with attendance growing dramatically each successive year. There are now eight stages, compared to just one back when it all began.
It’s time for Electric Daisy Carnival – India
The Delhi edition will be the first one ever in India! Time travel to an alternate reality, with a truly immersive visual and audio experience. A weekend affair: Happening over a Saturday and Sunday, this will be one of your highlight weekends of the year. The festival has included 60% Indian artists in the lineup and 3 spectacular stages. With shuttle running from Gurgaon & Noida, EDC Greater Noida will be a spectacle that will headline the music festival season.
India, where EDM’s popularity was kickstarted by nightclub culture, bolstered by festivals like Sunburn and Supersonic, is its newest outpost. “Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by the country’s colorful and exotic culture,” said Pasquale Rotella, founder and CEO of Insomniac Events, the events company behind the festival. “I know it’s a place where the magic of EDC can come alive in a truly unique way.”
OML’s CEO Vijay Nair was quoted as saying: “There are very few festivals that every EDM fan in the world talks about. Once I witnessed EDC in Las Vegas, I could see why. I have never seen a festival of this scale so beautifully executed. We can’t wait to bring that experience to Indian fans and blow their minds.”
All these factors make Electric Daisy Carnival India a tasty festival to be at. We hope all of you will have a great time! Stay safe and keep yourself hydrated!""" ;

ROBERT, HENRY MARTYN (1837–1923). Henry Martyn Robert, author of Robert's Rule of Order and consulting engineer of the Galveston seawall, was born on May 2, 1837, in Robertville, South Carolina, son of Rev. Joseph Thomas and Adeline (Lawton) Robert. His ancestor Pierre Robert was pastor of the first Huguenot colony in South Carolina. Reverend Robert was against slavery and moved his family to the Midwest when Henry was a child. Robert was appointed to West Point from Ohio and graduated fourth in his class in 1857. From 1867 until his retirement he was involved with most of the major river and harbor improvement and fortification projects undertaken by the United States government. He worked on the Columbia River and on rivers in Oregon and Washington. He built lighthouses on lakes Michigan, Erie, Ontario, and Champlain, and on the Saint Lawrence River. He made river and harbor improvements on Long Island Sound and New York Harbor. He was engineer-commissioner for improvements on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and was a member of various boards of engineering, such as the New York Board of Engineers, the New York Harbor Line Board, and the Philadelphia Line Board.
In 1889 President Grover Cleveland appointed him to a board of engineers to recommend a western Gulf port for the government to develop to handle tonnage that was increasing each year. Robert selected Galveston as the only site that could meet the conditions to become a major Gulf port. Congress approved his proposal and appropriated the funds. After the Galveston hurricane of 1900 Robert served as consulting chairman of the board of engineers to design means of protection against future tidal waves. The recommendations of this board resulted in a seawall that successfully saved the city of Galveston on two subsequent occasions, 1909 and 1915. After each tidal wave Robert was called back to report on seawall damage and to make further recommendations. He was also asked to help design a highway and railroad bridge between Galveston and the mainland. Just before he reached retirement age he was promoted to brigadier general, chief of engineers, United States Army, on April 30, 1901.
Robert also became this country's leading parliamentarian. Robert's Rules of Order, first published in February 1876, remained in print in the 1990s as an authoritative reference work on parliamentary procedure. Robert married Helen Thresher on December 21, 1860, and they had four children. Six years after she died, he married Isabel Livingston Hoagland, on May 8, 1901. Robert died on May 11, 1923, in Hornell, New York.

HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL. The Houston Ship Channel, one of the busiest waterways in the United States, achieved its earliest significance as a link between interior Texas and the sea. It traces its origin to early trade on Buffalo Bayou, which heads on the prairie thirty miles west of Houston in the extreme northeastern corner of Fort Bend County and runs southeast for fifty miles to the San Jacinto River and then into Galveston Bay. Recognizing the potential of the stream, the brothers John Kirby and Augustus Chapman Allen laid out the town of Houston at the head of navigation on Buffalo Bayou in 1836. The first steamboat, the Laura, arrived there on January 22, 1837. As the waterway proved to be the only one in Texas that was dependably navigable, planters over a large area brought their cotton to Houston to be shipped by barge or riverboat to Galveston, the best natural port in Texas. At Galveston cargoes were transferred to seagoing vessels and thence to market. Goods destined for the interior came upstream, and visitors and immigrants made the route one of the most traveled in Texas in the prerailroad era. Even after railroads and later automobiles diverted traffic, the route remained an important transportation artery for bulky goods. Initially, citizens of Houston took responsibility for clearing and maintaining the winding route to the sea. The city fathers established the Port of Houston on January 29, 1842, and the following year the Congress of the Republic of Texas granted the city the right to remove obstructions and otherwise improve the bayou. After Texas entered the Union, free wharfage was given to boat owners who contracted to keep the channel clean.
In the late 1850s Houston merchants chafed at the policies of the Galveston Wharf Company, which controlled Galveston harbor, and attempted to reach the sea without going through Galveston. After the interim of the Civil War, they renewed their efforts. In 1869 they organized the Buffalo Bayou Ship Channel Company to improve the channel, and in 1870 they persuaded Congress to make Houston a port of delivery. The United States Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the channel and recommended a width of 100 feet and a depth of six. Still, because of inadequate appropriations, this effort brought few improvements. At this point the Houstonians found an ally in Charles Morgan, a pioneer in Gulf Coast shipping who had also run athwart the Galveston Wharf Company. Desiring to bypass Galveston, Morgan bought the Bayou Ship Channel Company in 1874 and within two years dredged a channel from Galveston Bay to the site of present Clinton near Houston. The first ocean vessel arrived there September 22, 1876. Although Morgan is sometimes called "the Father of the Houston Ship Channel," he soon shifted his attention from ships to railroads, and his line abandoned the route in 1883. The United States government purchased his improvements in 1890 and thereafter accepted primary responsibility for the channel.
Houston Congressman Thomas H. Ball, after becoming a member of the Rivers and Harbors Committee in 1897, won increased appropriations for the project. Congress also approved a depth of twenty-five feet and the location of the terminus at Long Reach, now the Turning Basin. Yet, by 1909 the channel had been dredged to only 18½ feet. Impatient at the slow progress, Mayor Horace Baldwin Rice led a delegation to Washington to present the "Houston Plan," which offered to pay one-half of the cost of dredging the channel to twenty-five feet. After receiving assurances that the facilities would be publicly owned, Congress accepted the offer. Prior to Houston's offer, no substantial contributions had ever been made by local interests, but since then no project has been adopted by the national government without local contributions. The Texas legislature passed a bill enabling Harris County to establish a navigation district. The citizens then approved a bond issue of $1,250,000. Jesse H. Jones arranged for the sale of the bonds, and the dredging began. It was completed on September 7, 1914, and celebrated with great fanfare in the city. Because of shipping conditions during World War I, its deep water development was delayed until after the war. In 1919 an ocean-going vessel, the Merry Mount, took the first shipment of cotton directly from Houston to a foreign market, thus inaugurating a trade that made Houston the leading cotton port in the United States within a decade. Oil, which had been discovered in Texas early in the twentieth century, increasingly rivaled cotton as the most important cargo on the channel. Petroleum also led to the industrialization of the waterfront, for the long, protected channel with its nearby crude oil supplies proved an attractive location for oil refineries. By 1930 nine oil refineries operating along the channel contributed to the channel tonnage. Although the Great Depression briefly interrupted the progress, the Port of Houston ranked third in the nation in the amount of tonnage carried on the eve of World War II.
The war suspended normal shipping activities, but gave further impetus to the industrialization of the waterway. In addition to increasing the demand for customary petroleum products, the war inspired the development of synthetic rubber based on a byproduct of petroleum. Two synthetic rubber plants were located near the channel while the war was in progress, and after the war the channel became a center of the petrochemical industry. In the postwar years the port also became a major shipping point for midwestern grain. Growing foreign trade and new industry boosted the port to second in tonnage in the nation in 1948, and from then until 1964 it customarily ranked second or third. Thecombination of industry and transportation facilities, including a network of railroads, trucklines, and interstate highways, influenced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (see LYNDON B. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER) to select a site convenient to the channel as headquarters for the nation's space program in 1961.
Congress approved a project to widen the channel to 300 feet from Fidelity Island to the turning basin in 1945, and in 1957 army engineers recommended that the entire channel be deepened to forty feet. By 1964, the fiftieth anniversaryof the deepwater channel, the federal government had expended $64 million for channel improvement and maintenance, and the local government had invested $28 million in port facilities. In return, economic activities related to the channel yielded $148 million annually in taxes. The channel-side industrial complex, valued at $3 billion, and shipping activities gave employment to 55,000 persons who received $314 million in wages annually. The Port of Houston was the first in the nation to introduce container shipping. By the 1970s 4,500 ships flying the flags of sixty-one nations passed through the channel annually.
The heavy traffic alarmed environmentalists who noted growing pollution in the area and others who believed the Channel Industries Mutual Aid, formed in 1955, offered insufficient protection in case of accidents along the waterway. Between 1969 and 1972 some 700 vessel casualties were recorded, and in the 1980s and 1990s the channel received increasing attention from a series of oil spills, explosions, and collisions between tankers, freighters, and barges. At the time 90 percent of all poisonous cargo traveling by water passed through the channel, which remained only 200 feet wide and forty feet deep at its maximum. A single lawsuit sought recovery of $500 billion for damages. New plans to widen the channel were proposed, along with further new industrial tracts and petrochemical projects, but remained to be implemented.""" ;

INDIANOLA HURRICANES . The first of the two great Indianola hurricanes that resulted in the demise of the town began on September 15, 1875, when Indianola was crammed with visitors attending a trial growing out of the Sutton-Taylor Feud . The hurricane blew in from the sea, carrying the water from Matagorda Bay deep into Indianola's streets. Two days later, when the storm had subsided, only eight buildings were left undamaged, and fatalities were estimated at between 150 and 300 persons. After being rebuilt on a lesser scale, Indianola was completely destroyed by a second hurricane that blew in on August 19, 1886, this time accompanied by fire. This storm was considered worse than the first one, but because there was less town, it caused less damage.

Each year, crowd disasters happen in different areas of the world. How and why do such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior of people or a psychological state of panic that makes the crowd 'go mad'? Or are they a tragic consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other questions are addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available videos and materials, which document the planning and organization of the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our analysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also provide a new perspective on concepts such as 'intentional pushing', 'mass panic', 'stampede', and 'crowd crushs'. The focus of our analysis is on the contributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal issues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video recordings show that, in Duisburg, people stumbled and piled up due to a 'domino effect', resulting from a phenomenon called 'crowd turbulence' or 'crowd quake'. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be distinguished from crowd disasters resulting from 'panic stampedes' or 'crowd crushes'. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities. Accordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations to help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering that today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.""" ;

AGREEMENT REACHED WITH CITY OF MIAMI
Ultra Music Festival has announced its indefinite new home ahead of the monumental 21st edition, the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park and Miami Marine Stadium Flex Park. The world-renowned and internationally acclaimed event provided the message below, in a long-awaited statement to its fans:
‘We are excited to announce that the City of Miami has agreed to a deal to relocate Ultra Music Festival to the beautiful and historic Virginia Key. The new venue will allow the festival to evolve into its new, larger home, ultimately creating a more enjoyable experience for all festival attendees. We look forward to a long-term and mutually beneficial relationship with our partners at the City of Miami and Historic Virginia Key Beach Park as we commemorate keeping Ultra in the City of Miami.’
The new venue will permit an extended operating time until 2:00 A.M. and will provide the festival with an increased capacity. Attendees will also have vastly expanded space as compared to the former venue, Bayfront Park. Fans will also experience in-tandem staging at both the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park and Miami Marine Stadium Flex Park, creating a wholly unique single event space.
Due to the cultural and historic significance of Historic Virginia Key Beach Park and given the unique environmental considerations associated with the park, Ultra Music Festival intends to take extraordinarily great care in its production and remediation approaches. Ultra understands that staging an event at Virginia Key means becoming the entrusted stewards of the environmental and historic elements of Historic Virginia Key Beach Park.
Additionally the partnership will clear a path to accessing approximately $20 million that has been earmarked to build Miami-Dade County’s first African American Museum.
Ultra Music Festival looks forward to hosting fans from over 100 countries to close out Miami Music Week March 29-31, 2019.
Tickets are on sale now here.""" ;

<https://variety.com/2014/film/markets-festivals/sundance-film-review-under-the-electric-sky-2-1201066543/> dct:description """More high-grade souvenir for the previously converted than a very persuasive recruitment tool for those not already in love with EDM (electronic dance music), “Under the Electric Sky” records last year’s Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, currently the largest annual music fest in the U.S. Non-fans may find this 3D documentary only confirms their suspicion that EDM is possibly the most vapid form of “alternative” music, and its ecstatic fans constitute one of the most vacuous fanbases, ever. Limited theatrical exposure is likely, though the film’s principal audience will access it through home formats.
Directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz make a seemingly solid decision not to simply focus on the performers (who, twiddling dials and pointing emphatically skyward, aren’t much to watch) and the more colorful crowd, but on a disparate number of hand-picked attendees. Sadie and Jose are here because the music seems to melt away their limitations from anxiety disorder and scoliosis, respectively. Young professionals in love Jim and Jenna are seeing each other for the first time in six months, since their dream jobs keep them on separate continents. Five jock dudes have traveled from Cape Cod to commemorate a fellow “Wolf Pack” member who recently died from a drug O.D. A half-dozen Southern Californians in a live-in polyamorous relationship seem to live the EDC lifestyle 365 days a year.
Despite their superficial diversity, however, all these people look around 20-25, the exception being 35-ish Vegas couple Alli and Matt, who met at the festival 15 years ago and now have two kids. And no one here really has anything remotely interesting to say (not even the institution’s founder/CEO, Pasquale Rotella, whom we follow around a bit), unless you count umpteen variations on “This is so crazy great oh my god I love the energy everybody is so free ‘n’ stuff … EDC! EDC!” Add to that the one-finger-at-the-Casio-keyboard compositional nature of nearly all the music heard — occasional, more song-structured anthems like Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” aside — and the jubilant onscreen spirit may translate best for those who can experience it as a personal Ecstasy flashback. (Commissioned by EDC producer Insomniac, the pic downplays the role of drugs at what’s officially a zero-tolerance three-day party, but … please.)
The festival is festooned with wandering acrobats, clowns, et al., as well as plenty of pop sculptures, pyrotechnics, amusement-park-like attractions, and seven stages (though we only ever seem to see one of them, with a giant owl backdrop). Star DJs are name-checked and briefly interviewed, but EDM is a genre whose synaptic potency builds over the course of a set. Hearing just brief extracts from sets as they approach climax just underlines how simple, repetitious and samey the form overwhelmingly is.
Despite the whimsy of much raver finery and the love/peace/acceptance vibe, there’s also a sameness to the revelers. If EDC draws any gays, African-Americans or body types not ideal for wearing glorified bikinis or board shorts, you wouldn’t know it from the evidence here. The effect is as much like a giant spring-break bacchanal as it is like a commercialized Burning Man or supersized old-school underground rave.
Ergo, the pic provides lots of sexy, neon-hued eye-candy but not many images of deeper resonance. Bookended by flat sequences (before and after the festival), the 3D format surprisingly isn’t exploited all that effectively in Reed Smoot’s otherwise accomplished lensing. Other tech/design contributions are top-shelf, and of course the sound mix is aces. Still, if ever a movie begged for revival of butt-rumbling 1970s theater gimmick Sensurround, it’s “Under the Electric Sky,” with its incessant audio orgasms of thumping bass.""" ;

<https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/ultra-music-festival-no-refunds-1203529247/> dct:description """This is where the distinction between cancellation and postponement becomes clear: The 2020 Ultra Music Festival, one of the world’s largest dance-music events, was “postponed” last week after city officials expressed concern about the spread of coronavirus.
While the festival will not take place in 2020, the postponement means that instead of paying refunds to ticketholders, organizers are offering replacement tickets for the 2021 or 2022 events in Miami, according to an email obtained by the Miami Herald. The replacement ticket also comes with a list of benefits that include discount codes for merchandise and tickets.
Reps for the festival did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.
The Herald noted that Miami’s Bayfront Park, where Ultra 2020 was to take place, has not yet been contractually secured for future installments of the festival.
“ALL tickets purchased will of course remain valid and will be honored at either the 2021 or 2022 Ultra Miami event, at your option,” read an email issued by the festival late Monday. “You will have 30 days to choose which Ultra Miami event you want to attend. Additionally, we are also working to offer a digital online Ultra experience as soon as possible.” The festival also offered elements that “add value” to tickets that are apparently nonrefundable, including discounted upgrades, tickets to other Ultra events and half off of up to $250 in merchandise.
“Even though the situation is completely beyond our control, we are fully engaged, pushing forward to go above and beyond for you,” the notice reads. “In seeing that commitment through, we have worked around the clock to assemble an extraordinary added value package for you.”
The word “cancellation” did not appear in any official notices about the festival not happening in 2020. The official statement passed the buck for the decision to an official directive from the city of Miami in its effort to curb any coronavirus spread — an important point when it comes to insurance and other purposes, as a story in Variety yesterday pointed out.
“We want to emphasize that this decision is not a cause for alarm or signal to panic,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said at a Friday morning news conference. “Rather, we are doing this out of an abundance of caution.”""" ;

'Dangerous storm' wallops East Coast, snarls travel
BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A raging nor'easter howled up the East Coast on Sunday, breaking a snowfall record in New York, shutting down airports and dumping more than two feet of snow on parts of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states.
Central Park in New York City had recorded nearly 27 inches by about 4:15 p.m. Sunday, breaking a record of 26.4 inches set in December 1947, according to the National Weather Service.
Other snowfall totals included 27.8 inches in Fairfield, Connecticut; 25.4 inches at New York's LaGuardia Airport; 21.3 inches in Columbia, Maryland, near Baltimore; and more than a foot in parts of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service.
The storm packed winds of up to 40 mph as it brushed the coast, and some parts of New England remained under blizzard warnings into Sunday evening, the National Weather Service reported.
Lightning and thunder accompanied some of the snowfall. The National Weather Service called the rare phenomenon "thundersnow."
The heavy snow shut down Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport and all three major New York City-area airports -- LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty International. That forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, snarling air traffic nationwide.
But by 6 p.m. Sunday, only LaGuardia and smaller regional airports remained closed. Airlines urged passengers to call or check company Web sites for details and rescheduling information.
LaGuardia was set to reopen at 6 a.m. Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. As of Sunday night, passengers were experiencing delays of more than 4 hours at John F. Kennedy Airport, and up to 2 hours at Philadelphia International Airport.
Washington was briefly under a snow emergency Sunday, with 119,000 customers without power at one point, along with 62,000 customers in Baltimore and thousands more in New York and New Jersey.
"Make no mistake, this is a dangerous storm," said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who urged residents and tourists to stay indoors and cautioned strongly against driving.
Transit in the New York region was also slowed, with Metro-North Railroad service affected. Long Island Rail Road trains into and out of Pennsylvania Station were halted.
New York City's subway and bus systems were operating, though buses were running less frequently than usual, according to the Port Authority.
The city's sanitation department had 2,500 workers on the streets, each working 12-hour shifts for around-the-clock snow removal as New York prepared for Monday morning's rush hour.
One New Yorker noted the contrast with the city's milder weather in recent weeks.
"It's sort of crazy because it was so warm a couple of weeks ago and now we have knee-deep snow," Skye Drynan told The Associated Press as she walked her dogs Bella and Forest in Lower Manhattan.
The manager of a ski resort in Londonberry, Vermont, told the Reuters news agency that he welcomed the snow.
"I think this will get people back in the spirit of winter and skiing," Gary Aichholz said.
Airlines cancel flights
Delta, the second-busiest airline in the United States, canceled all of its Sunday flights at Boston's Logan International Airport and T.F. Green International Airport outside Providence, Rhode Island.
The airline was offering only limited service at airports in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Hartford, Connecticut, spokeswoman Gina Laughlin said.
The airline also suspended Delta Shuttle operations between New York, Boston and Washington, she said.
US Airways spokesman Carlo Bertolini said the airline had canceled at least 40 flights each out of Boston, Washington and Philadelphia.
Logan International Airport remained open, but 90 percent of the daily 1,250 scheduled inbound and outbound flights were canceled, spokesman Richard Walsh said.
Boston Public Schools will be closed Monday, according to the system's Web site.
At Philadelphia International Airport, spokesman Mark Pesce said 30 percent of its arrivals and departures had been canceled.""" ;

A warm low-pressure weather system from the Gulf of Mexico collided with a stationary cold Arctic high-pressure air mass to create an ideal combination of layered air masses at just the right temperatures. Together they produced a mixture of ice and supercooled liquid (that is, it remains liquid below the freezing point) that covered colder objects on the ground with a veneer of solid ice. Over the next five days, two more southerly air systems pushed north over southern Ontario (as far west as Kitchener and Muskoka) and south-western Quebec, and continued east over New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The American states of New York, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire were also hit. Areas south of Montréal and upper New York State received up to 100 mm (millimetre) of freezing precipitation. As damage and losses increased, the storm created a dazzling display of crystallized beauty—an ironic reminder of Nature's power. Record numbers of people affected
No other recorded storm in Canadian history deposited so much freezing precipitation over such a large area—about 176,700 km 2 (square kilometre) (an area larger than the three Maritime provinces) received over 20 mm of freezing precipitation. In Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia about 7.6 million people, or about 25% of Canada's population, lived in the area where 20 mm or more of freezing precipitation accumulated. About 20,000 rural homes and 1,300 farms were in the southwestern Quebec area hit with 100 mm of freezing precipitation. About 2 million of the people affected by the storm were rural and small-town residents. Another 1.4 million people in the northeastern United States felt the storm's effect. Left powerless
Over 1,300 steel transmission towers toppled under the weight of the ice and almost 35,000 wooden utility poles were brought down. Some Ontario residents were without power for 21 days; in Quebec, the hardship lasted up to 32 days. Rebuilding the hydro-electrical overhead wire system became an urgent priority. Almost 80% of the people living in areas that received 40 mm or more of freezing precipitation lost their electrical power for some time during the storm. Farmers had special problems
While the electrical loss was devastating for everyone, rural communities were without power longest. The dairy and maple industries were particularly hard hit. Nearly one-quarter of all dairy cows in Canada (274,000) were in the affected area. About 23,800 farms were hit with over 40 mm of freezing precipitation. Ninety percent of eastern Ontario's and about one-quarter of southwestern Quebec's dairy farmers were without electricity at some time. Many eastern Ontario farmers, accustomed to a stable power supply, were unprepared for such an emergency. Many farmers dealt with the power loss by buying or sharing a generator. When the local supply of generators quickly ran out, more arrived from elsewhere in Canada and from as far away as Georgia, Texas and California. Without power, the animals suffered and the modern automated farm became a collection of useless machinery. Without regular milking, feeding and plentiful water, the animals lost weight and were susceptible to disease, dehydration and stress, conditions that could lead to birthing problems and reduced milk production. The inability to maintain cleanliness standards led to high bacteria counts on both equipment and animals. Increased humidity or excessive heat, and drafts from poor ventilation increased the incidence of pneumonia. Of course, not only farms were without electricity; without power, local milk processors were also incapacitated. Some milk was dumped—about 2.3 million L (litre) in Ontario and about 3.3 million L in Quebec—a loss of over $3 million. The dairy industry adjusted to the effects of the storm and reduced its losses by diverting 1 million L of milk from Ontario to a processing facility in Michigan and 2.5 million L from Quebec to processing facilities in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Some milk that had been destined for the "fluid" market (that is, milk for drinking) was salvaged for industrial uses (for example, for cheese and powdered milk). January's monthly volume of milk production actually increased slightly in Ontario and was unchanged in Quebec compared with the previous month. Consumers themselves felt little impact from the storm: Enough milk was already available when the storm struck to easily satisfy consumer demand. Maple syrup producers endured great losses
In 1997 maple syrup production was a $125-million industry in Quebec and Ontario. Quebec usually produces about 90% of Canada's maple production and Ontario about 5%. (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia produce the remaining 5%.) In Quebec an estimated 2,500 maple syrup producers, with about 30% of the province's 25 million to 26 million maple taps, were in the storm's path. (One tree can have from one to four "taps," the spigot used to collect the sap.) The maple syrup producers of the Montérégie area and the Eastern Townships were hit hardest. Ten percent of the trees there were seriously affected and considered destroyed—representing about $5 million in lost income. About 25% of Ontario's 1.2 million maple tree taps were hit by the ice storm. Estimates put losses in maple syrup production at up to 50% of eastern Ontario's $4 million per year industry over the next 10 years. Where damage was severe, some losses may be felt for up to 40 years. Significant income generated from spin-offs associated with the industry, such as tourism, will also be lost. A costly clean-up
The ice sheared treetops, and the branches pulled down and buried the plastic tubing that collects the sap from the trees. The maple bush became dangerous for clean-up and restoration. To make matters worse, the clean-up had to be done quickly, as warm temperatures caused the sap to run early. Restoring damaged trees and equipment will cost an estimated $3 million in eastern Ontario. Quebec estimates its cost at about $30 million. The aftermath
After three weeks in Ontario and over a month in Quebec the last of the rural homes regained power. Throughout the storm and for weeks after, many stories were told of the spirit of the rural community: generosity, courage, compassion, patience and determination. Many people had to endure the stress and trauma of leaving their unheated homes and moving to shelters. But most farmers remained isolated on their farms to care for their livestock. For everyone, the sound of tree limbs snapping under the weight of the ice was a constant reminder that this was a storm to be reckoned with. While prices for their products barely showed an economic impact from the storm, many farmers will have long-term economic consequences. They must rebuild their barns, greenhouses and other structures that were crushed or damaged by the weighty ice. Others have had to replenish their livestock or replant their apple orchards, raspberries, and Christmas trees. Much has been learned from this storm about rural emergency preparedness, planning and action. Many farms and many rural homeowners now have a generator tucked safely in their barn or shed. Rural communities and farmers have a new respect for the powers of Nature and a new confidence that they are better prepared for the next time she unleashes her destructive powers.

7Weather Video Forecast
Cindie Fitzgerald, director of guest services at Wachusett Ski Resort in central Massachusetts said Sunday's snowstorm was "what we've all been waiting for" after an unseasonably mild January.
But Dave Allison and Beth Todzia were less-than-thrilled as they stood inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Boston and watched the snow rip past the window. They had come to Massachusetts from southern Connecticut for an early Valentine's Day getaway, but their plans changed to "trying to figure out how to get home," Allison said.
Across southern New England Sunday, heavy snow and whipping winds had most people huddled in their homes rather than enjoying the first major winter blast of the season. Church services were canceled, flights delayed and parking bans were in effect across the region.
Rhode Island Gov. Don Carcieri declared a state of emergency, as blizzard conditions settled across the area. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered officials to open the state emergency operations center at the state Armory in Hartford to coordinate state and local efforts.
Boston Mayor Tom Menino canceled school for Monday and urged residents and visitors to stay off the roads -- whether they traveled by foot or car. He said it was simply too dangerous with the whiteout conditions.
Gusty winds created snow drifts of more than 3 feet in some areas and low visibility meant tricky conditions to navigate.
Logan Airport reported zero visibility at times, but remained open, along with T.F. Green in Warwick, R.I. Delta Airlines, however, canceled all flights to and from both airports, and other airlines were experiencing delays and cancelations.
In Boston, commuter and subway trains operated on a normal schedule, but many buses used different routes to avoid hills and narrow roads.
The National Weather Service reported more than 21 inches of snow in the Hartford, Conn.-area. More than a foot fell in Springfield, and the Providence area saw at least 7 inches by late morning. Boston recorded about 13.5 inches by Sunday evening.
Outer Cape Cod and Nantucket were getting a mix of sleet and snow with winds up to 60 mph.
In the coastal town of Chatham, there was minor flooding around high tide. The docks were under water and water lapped into the parking lot at the Chatham Fish Pier. Most of the town's commercial fishing fleet had taken refuge in protected harbors.
Roads along the Cape were mostly empty throughout the height of the storm, with the exception of plows. Stores also were closed.
"When you get suckered into a nice January with relatively mild temperatures, you think this isn't possible. But clearly it is," said Bill Simpson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass.
Heeding the advice of officials who warned of whiteout conditions on many roads, few people ventured out into the storm if they didn't have to.
Karen Gulley of Mansfield, Mass., took her two young children to Boston to visit the New England Aquarium, but their plans changed to snowman-building because of the storm.
"It's their favorite thing to do," Gulley said.

The Blizzard of ’78 continued through Thursday and into Friday. Transportation, business, industry, and schools were closed statewide for two days with the normal pace of society not returning to the state for five days. Atmospheric pressure fell to 28.28 inches at Cleveland, the lowest ever recorded in Ohio, as the center of the blizzard crossed Ohio. This rapidly intensifying storm pulled bitterly cold air across Ohio on winds of 50 to 70 mph. These conditions, combined with heavy snow and blowing of deep snow already on the ground, caused extreme blizzard conditions all across Ohio. Enormous snowdrifts covered cars and houses, blocked highways and railways, and closed all airports for two days.
More than 5,000 members of the Ohio National Guard were called to duty and were pressed into long hours of work with heavy equipment clearing roads, assisting electric utility crews, rescuing stranded persons, and transporting doctors and nurses to hospitals. Forty-five National Guard helicopters flew 2,700 missions across Ohio rescuing thousands of stranded persons, many in dire medical emergencies. Thousands of volunteers with snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles responded to pleas from police statewide to deliver medicine and transport doctors and nurses to hospitals. The death toll of 51 made this one of the deadliest winter storms in Ohio history.

Operation RECUPERATION January 8February 8, 1998 On January 4, 1998, an ice storm of epic proportions began in east central Canada. After about 80 hours of intermittent freezing rain and drizzle  nearly double the normal annual total  the icefall stopped on January 8, and the temperature dropped sharply. The weight of ice brought down millions of trees, the roofs of large buildings such as barns and arenas, 120,000 km of power lines and telephone cables, 130 major transmission towers, and about 30,000 wooden utility poles. The storm did the most damage in western New Brunswick, southern Quebec and eastern Ontario, especially around Montréal and in the farming communities of the lower Ottawa Valley. More than 1 million households  about 900,000 in Quebec and 100,000 in Ontario, comprising some 4 million people  lacked electricity, which meant no lights, central heating, running water, refrigeration or hot meals. Twenty-five people died, most of them from hypothermia. With the roads blocked by fallen trees, broken power lines and rivers of ice, emergency vehicles could hardly move. On January 7, the provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec requested aid from the Canadian Forces, and Operation RECUPERATION began on January 8. It was the largest deployment of troops ever to serve on Canadian soil in response to a natural disaster, and the largest operational deployment of Canadian military personnel since the Korean War. CF members from about 200 units across Canada helped provincial and municipal workers clear roads, rescue people and animals trapped by storm wreckage, evacuate the sick, shelter and feed about 100,000 people frozen out of their homes, and ensure that farmers had the generators and fuel required to keep their operations going. Military engineers and technicians worked around the clock with hydro and telephone crews to repair and replace downed transmission towers and utility poles. On January 13, at the request of the Province of Quebec, CF members assumed the powers of peace officers in the most devastated areas around Montréal. At the height of the crisis, Operation RECUPERATION involved 15,784 deployed Army, Navy and Air Force personnel (including 3,740 Reservists): 10,550 in Quebec, 4,850 in Ontario and 384 in New Brunswick. In addition, 6,200 CF members and DND employees working at their regular jobs provided the logistical support required to sustain the operation.""" ;

SPRINGFIELD, Missouri (AP) -- A crippling winter storm lashed the central part of the nation with another blast of freezing rain, sleet and snow Saturday, causing widespread power outages and tying up highways and airports.
The storm was expected to continue through the weekend, laying down a coat of ice and snow from Texas to Illinois, where an ice storm warning was in effect through Monday morning.
"We're in the middle of this storm," said Joe Pedigo, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in St. Louis. "Friday was the first of three waves." (Watch resident describe gunshot-like sound of snapping branches )
Farther west, frigid arctic air reached as far south as southern and central California, where plunging temperatures prompted worry about the homeless and crops.
The storm in the Midwest had been blamed for at least seven deaths, and brought Amtrak service in Missouri to a halt on Saturday. Trees and other debris knocked down by the weight of ice blocked tracks at several locations between St. Louis and Kansas City.
About 90,000 homes and businesses had no electricity Saturday in Missouri, mostly in the St. Louis area, while 6,000 customers were in the dark in Illinois.
"We have hundreds of crews. We kept them working all night long," Susan Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the utility Ameren, said Saturday. "Like everyone, we don't know what the extent of damage will be with the arrival of more ice."
Between 60,000 and 70,000 customers were without power in Springfield, Missouri, Saturday, plus an unknown number of homes and businesses in surrounding towns, said Jenny Fillmer Edwards, spokeswoman for the Springfield-Greene County Office of Emergency Management.
Roads in southwest Missouri began freezing after sunset. Two shelters in Springfield filled Saturday and emergency officials planned to open one more. There were also three shelters for people with special needs and medical conditions.
Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt and Texas Gov. Rick Perry activated their National Guard members on Saturday. Blunt, who also declared a state of emergency, said the worst wave may come Sunday. (Watch the forces at work to create this storm )
Tornado damages homes in Texas
In San Marcos, Texas, a tornado damaged at least 13 homes, several businesses and the police headquarters. Fallen power lines blocked a section of Interstate 35 until crews could remove them, said Melissa Millecam, communications manager for the city, 30 miles south of Austin.
"It's a good bit of damage," she said. "It's still stormy and we've got power outages in different places."
More than 6 inches of rain fell in places across Central Texas, causing local flooding. Water also blocked three highways in southeastern Oklahoma, the Department of Transportation reported.
About 300 flights were canceled Saturday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, spokesman David Magana said. Cancellations also were reported in St. Louis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
In Oklahoma, about 92,450 customers were without power early Saturday, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said.
Another wave of winter on the way
More rain, freezing rain and snow was expected from northwest Oklahoma all the way to Wisconsin on Sunday, Pedigo said.
In Nevada, temperatures plunged as much as minus 28 in the northern part of the state, filling homeless shelters to capacity and prompting ranchers to use axes to break ice in troughs so cattle could drink, authorities said.
In California's San Joaquin Valley, where much of the state's nearly $1 billion citrus crop is grown, temperatures dropped into the teens overnight Friday. Growers burned fires, sprayed warm irrigation water and ran giant fans to keep cold air away from their oranges, lemons and tangerines.
A.J. Yates, California's agriculture undersecretary, said the citrus industry could be substantially damaged if the temperature stays below 25 degrees for six hours or longer. Citrus growers said it was too soon to evaluate the damage.
"Overall I don't think it was a catastrophe last night," grower Ron Turner, 52, of Exeter, said Saturday. "But how this thing plays out in the next few days is going to be the key."

BUFFALO, Missouri (AP) -- Shoppers were reduced to picking up supplies by flashlight Tuesday in the few places open in this town of 2,800, as the death toll from a winter storm grew to 51 in nine states.
Three shelters in Buffalo -- about 35 miles north of Springfield in hard-hit Missouri -- housed nearly a tenth of its population Monday night, and officials said power might not be restored until next week.
The town lost all its power by Saturday. Water towers ran dry Sunday, and water service was restored only late Monday, after the National Guard hooked a generator up to a pumping station.
"There are no services," Buffalo Mayor Jerry Hardesty said. "I've talked to residents who have lived here 50 years, and nobody can remember it ever being this bad."
About 400,000 homes and businesses in several states were still without electricity Tuesday after a storm that brought ice, snow, flooding and high winds to a swath of the country from Texas to Maine. (Watch the winter storm take a toll across the nation )
The storm had largely blown out of New England by Tuesday, but forecasters expected more freezing rain to hit parts of Texas, perhaps even Houston, on Wednesday night, said Dennis Cook of the National Weather Service. Gusty winds were forecast to make the Northeast bone-chilling cold through Wednesday night before warming Thursday.
At the First Baptist Church in McAlester, Oklahoma, where most of the city's 18,000 residents have lacked power for four days, 47 residents huddled under blankets and in front of space heaters.
"If it wasn't for the shelter, I don't know where we'd be," said Tara Guzman, 38, playing board games with her four children. "We're tough; we lasted when the power went out until [Monday]. We brought mattresses out in the living room and cuddled."
Subfreezing temperatures were expected to continue in the state, with little sunshine to aid in melting the ice until Thursday or Friday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Brown.
Some of the 92,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses without power might not have it restored until next week, utility company spokesman said.
"There are a lot of places where virtually everything is destroyed," Public Service Company of Oklahoma spokesman Stan Whiteford said. "In some cases, entire electric services will have to be rebuilt."
Texas Gov. Rick Perry moved his inauguration ceremony indoors for the first time in five decades.
In Missouri, the utility company Ameren said it would probably not have everyone's lights back on until Wednesday night. As of Tuesday, about 210,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity.
The White House said Tuesday that 34 Missouri counties and St. Louis had been declared a major disaster area, making federal funding available. A similar federal disaster declaration was approved Sunday for Oklahoma.
More than 200,000 customers in Michigan also lost power at some point, and tens of thousands were still blacked out Tuesday. Many customers were also without power in central and western New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
Waves of freezing rain, sleet and snow since Friday had been blamed for at least 17 deaths in Oklahoma, nine in Missouri, eight in Iowa, four in New York, five in Texas, three in Michigan, three in Arkansas, and one each in Maine and Indiana.
Elsewhere, Washington state's Puget Sound area, known for drizzle rather than its recent freezing weather, was hit by another round of snow Tuesday, snarling traffic and closing schools for more than 380,000 students. The Oregon Legislature delayed hearings and sessions until afternoon because of the weather.
In California, three nights of freezing weather had destroyed up to three-quarters of the state's $1 billion citrus crop, according to an estimate issued Monday. Other crops, including avocados and strawberries, also suffered damage. (Full story)
"This is one of those freezes that, unfortunately, we'll all remember," said A.G. Kawamura, secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

DALLAS, Texas (AP) -- Areas of the central United States that were still cleaning up and restoring power after recent snow and ice storms scrambled Thursday to stock up on sand and de-icing chemicals as another cold blast approached.
Much of Oklahoma and parts of Missouri were expected to get 6 inches of snow from Friday to Sunday, even as utilities in those states worked to restore electricity to more than 170,000 customers who lost it in the most recent storm.
In Texas, the wintry weather due Friday was expected to be less severe than the pelting of snow and freezing rain that paralyzed much of the state this week and left San Antonio, Austin and Houston with icy conditions rarely seen there.
Those cities were expected to avoid the worst of the incoming storm. But to the west in El Paso, officials prepared for bad weather by announcing county offices would be closed Friday. Freezing weather also was expected in northern parts of the state, including Dallas.
Sand and de-icing chemicals used on roads will be rationed in far West Texas this weekend, said Blanca Del Valle, a Texas Department of Transportation spokeswoman in El Paso.
In other parts of the state, bridges and overpasses probably will be given priority. Icy roads that normally would get treatment might not if supplies are in question, department spokesman Randy Ormsby said. (Watch tips for driving on icy roads )
Hard-hit areas that used most of their de-icing chemicals earlier this week are "scrambling now to get more," he said.
"It's a problem we've never seen before. We typically don't go through this much ice and snow statewide."
At least 70 deaths related to winter weather have been reported in nine states in the past week, including 23 in Oklahoma and 12 each in Texas and Missouri. (Watch how the storms have left thousands in the dark )
Texas airports largely grounded by freezing rain earlier this week resumed mostly normal schedules Thursday. Formerly ice-slicked roads also reopened, including a 300-mile stretch of Interstate 10 from Fort Stockton to San Antonio that had been shut down since Tuesday.
'It looks like Godzilla came through there'
In Oklahoma, Gov. Brad Henry requested a major federal disaster declaration, which would make people in hard-hit counties eligible for housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses.
Ice snapped hundreds of power poles and transmission lines in eastern Oklahoma; more than 63,000 people remained without power Thursday, six days after freezing rain began to fall. More than 1,000 people remained in shelters and many schools remained closed. (Watch the many ways ice is creating havoc )
Mike Mackey, 47, who has been staying in an American Red Cross shelter in Muskogee with his wife and son, said the crushing weight of ice broke trees throughout his neighborhood.
"It looks like Godzilla came through there and just stomped them all down," he said.
Erik Parrott, 28, a house framer, was going door-to-door with a chain saw, helping friends cut up fallen trees and branches. He has gas heaters to take the chill off his house but no hot water, so he has had to go elsewhere to shower.
"I've been going to my ex-wife's unfortunately," he said.
In Missouri, particularly in the state's southwest section, more than 108,000 homes and businesses were still without power Thursday, the State Emergency Management Office said.
The state has suffered a string of extended storm-caused blackouts, and Robert Clayton, a member of the state commission that regulates investor-owned utilities, said power companies need to do more to prevent such outages.
"We've been told we had the storm of the century in 2004, then there was one in 2005, then there were three in 2006," Clayton said. "If weather patterns have changed, and I don't know that they have, then we have to change the way we're thinking about utility reliability."
Along with the fatalities in Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri, the wave of storms was blamed for eight deaths in Iowa, four each in New York and Michigan, three in Arkansas, two in North Carolina and one each in Maine and Indiana.
Cold snap wipes out much of citrus crop
In California, a four-night cold snap wiped out as much as three-quarters of the state's citrus and harmed virtually every other winter crop, from avocados to flowers. (Read how cold snap affects your grocery bill)
Texas citrus growers in the usually balmy Rio Grande Valley also suffered a cold snap, but it wasn't severe enough to damage crops, said John McClung, president of the Texas Produce Association.
"The weather's nowhere near cold enough to do anything here," he said, noting that Texas growers might get a small windfall because of the California freeze.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Oklahoma (AP) -- Ice storms that have been blamed for at least 20 deaths continued to lash much of the nation Sunday, as crews struggled to restore power to hundreds of thousands.
Waves of freezing rain made roads slick and caused accidents.
Sleet and snow since Friday have caused at least 11 deaths in Oklahoma, six in Missouri, two in Texas and one in New York.

About 350 National Guardsmen were going door to door checking on residents in the hardest-hit areas and were helping to clear slick roads of tree limbs and power lines.
"We have what appears to be a three-wave storm," he said. "We're in the final wave of it."
About 111,000 customers lacked power in Oklahoma, utilities reported.
In Texas, 415 flights were canceled Sunday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
In Nebraska, which has been pummeled by winter storms in the past month, the weekend storm dropped even more snow, making roads treacherous.
As the storm began to fade from the nation's midsection, parts of the East began to suffer.
In Albany, New York, a 22-year-old died after falling about 90 feet from a bridge to a road below after climbing a railing to avoid being hit by a sliding car.
He had gotten out of his vehicle around 2 a.m. after a crash.
In Syracuse, New York, Interstate 81 was closed for about two hours after about 30 cars were involved in six accidents early Sunday. Several people were taken to hospitals.
The storm system was expected to continue heading northeast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Pedigo.
While the Ohio region could see rain Monday afternoon, lower Michigan and parts of New England could see more than a foot of snow.
In the St. Louis region, about 150,000 people remained without power Sunday afternoon, after a pattern of freezing and thaws. (Watch tree limbs snap under weight of ice )
"We've had three real pushes of rainfall," said National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Kramper.
One was Friday, one Saturday and a third came Sunday afternoon and persisted into the evening.
Anthony Younger, 29, on a break from his job as a fast-food restaurant manager, said his family has lost power three times in stormy weather since this summer, once for about two weeks, he said.
"Here we go again," he said when his power went out in the St. Louis, Missouri, suburb of Florissant this weekend. It has since been restored.
Severe storms in July led to a power blackout of several days in the St. Louis area.
Younger said relatives now are in the habit of checking in with one another, figuring out who still has electricity and shuttling between residences.
Despite his experience, weather-related disruptions don't get easier, he said. "You never get used to it."

DENVER, Colorado (AP) -- The latest in a series of winter storms battered Colorado on Sunday, dumping several inches of snow and whipping up strong wind that created whiteout conditions on the state's eastern plains.
Accidents caused by blowing snow and icy roads closed southbound Interstate 25 near Fort Collins for two hours Sunday morning. State Patrol Master Trooper Ron Watkins said no injuries were reported.

No serious injuries were reported in the late-morning incident.
The crew of Flight 1726 bound from Milwaukee to Detroit, Michigan, "opted to discontinue its takeoff due to an engine problem," an airline statement said.
The plane came to a stop off the runway surface, the statement said.
The plane skidded when the pilot applied the brakes, said Pat Rowe, spokeswoman for General Mitchell International Airport.
A blizzard warning was in effect for much of eastern and northeastern Colorado, and the State Patrol advised against unnecessary travel.
The stormy weather in Colorado followed closely on the heels of a storm that spread heavy snow across parts of the Plains on Saturday, limiting visibility and creating hazardous driving conditions.
That storm was blamed for at least eight traffic deaths: four in Nebraska, three in Kansas and one in Oklahoma. (Watch what falling ice did to one man and his car in Tulsa )
The Plains storm spared much of Oklahoma from heavy snow, but utilities reported about 30,000 homes and business were still without power Sunday because of an ice storm one week earlier.
"We're coming down to what we expect to be very near the end of the restoration process," said Stan Whiteford, a spokesman for Public Service Company of Oklahoma, which reported about 4,000 customers still blacked out, mostly in the McAlester area. "We think we're going to be pretty close to wrapping things up." (Watch FEMA assess damage in Oklahoma )
Authorities in Oklahoma's Pittsburg and McIntosh counties implemented a nighttime curfew following reports of break-ins and the theft of generators set up to power railroad crossing guards.

PHOENIX, Arizona (AP) -- A rare snowstorm that surprised Arizona with more than a foot of snow left the state Monday, giving children as far south as Tucson a chance to play in the snow.
One of the strongest of the winter, Sunday's storm brought snow, ice and strong winds to the Plains region, and also to the Southwest, including Texas and New Mexico.
The harsh, frigid conditions were blamed for at least 11 traffic fatalities in the Plains over the weekend.
In Colorado, crews looking for a missing snowshoer found his body in a creek southwest of Denver on Monday.
In Arizona, more than a foot of snow fell in Forest Lakes, Pinetop and at the Sunrise Ski Resort, among other places in the northern part of the state. ( Watch amazed Arizona residents react to the rare snowfall )
Between 1 and 3 inches fell in Flagstaff, said Robert Bohlin, meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Southern New Mexico picked up 9 inches on snow on Sunday and Monday.
Some public schools in the southern and western parts of the state closed Monday.
Dense fog and icy roads created hazardous driving conditions Monday morning in the Tucson area.
Phoenix, which got a dusting the day before, largely returned to normal on Monday, and residents appeared happy with the unexpected precipitation.
"I love it," said Sandy LaCava, general manager of the Eclectic Cafe. "It was so quiet."
A white Colorado
In Colorado, where strong winds created whiteout conditions on the state's eastern plains, dozens of schools opened late or were closed Monday.
The coroner's office in Colorado's Jefferson County confirmed that a body found near a reservoir on the edge of the Denver area was that of Mel Dinklage, 46.
The cause of death was not determined.
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Shires said Dinklage lived in the Denver area and was an inexperienced snowshoer.
In Oklahoma, where an ice storm disrupted power to as many as 125,000 homes and businesses more than a week ago, about 12,500 customers remained without power Monday.
In Missouri, more than 45,000 people remained in the dark from the same storm as of Sunday.

• Official says FEMA teams are assessing damage in the area
• Powerful storms strike region still recovering from Katrina
• About 21,000 people are without power in New Orleans area
Adjust font size:
NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- Eighteen months after Hurricane Katrina, Stella Chambers' modest red-brick house had finally been repaired, and she was waiting for one last utility hookup to move back in. But the 85-year-old woman never made it.
A tornado tore through her neighborhood in the city's Gentilly neighborhood before daybreak Tuesday, flattening her house, ripping apart the front-yard FEMA trailer in which she was living, and killing her.
At least 29 people were injured, including Chambers' daughter, Gail, as the twister heaped more misery on neighborhoods still trying to recover from Katrina. The storm destroyed at least 50 FEMA trailers and dozens of homes, and damaged many others -- many of which were in various states of repair. (Watch witnesses describe how area will cope with latest setback )
"We were trying to get my mother back in the house. Now there is nothing to repair," said Mervin Pollard, whose 81-year-old mother's Katrina-flooded home was reduced to a pile of lumber Tuesday. "How do you start over again when you are already trying to do that?"
Firefighters went door to door, once again searching for victims of a storm. They spray-painted bright orange rectangles on the buildings and trailers and, as with the circles searchers used after Hurricane Katrina, they listed the date of the search and whether bodies were found.
"Some of these houses still have the circle on them from the last search," resident Patrick Clementine said. "Now we're doing it again."
Gov. Kathleen Blanco became teary-eyed as she talked to residents of the suburb of Westwego whose homes were destroyed.
"It's incredible. It just looks like pickup sticks," she said. "People's lives just torn asunder again."
Blanco issued a disaster declaration, authorizing state aid for the area. She said the state would send in National Guard troops for security.
The tornado hopscotched a 10-mile path from the west bank of the Mississippi River to the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, striking some neighborhoods that had been hard hit by Katrina and have been slow to recover.
In Gentilly, there are vast stretches of abandoned, gutted houses, dotted by trailers and occasional reoccupied dwellings. Some abandoned houses collapsed in the twister's winds.
Blood covered Gail Chambers' face and was running down her side when she banged on the door for help at about 3:30 a.m., said neighbor Hellean Lewis.
"She was crying and screaming, 'Help me! I can't find my mother!'" Lewis said. Searchers found Stella Chambers, crying for her daughter and clinging to life in the rubble. She died at a hospital, where her daughter was listed in stable condition.
There was no immediate estimate of the cost of the damage.
About 21,000 electricity customers in the New Orleans area lost power.
Federal Emergency Management Agency teams began inspecting neighborhoods and said it would provide hotel rooms and trailers for people whose FEMA trailers were unusable. The American Red Cross said 90 people were in shelters late Monday afternoon.
Some storm victims faced the prospect of once again having to find temporary shelter and do battle with insurance companies.
Kamal Namazi, 49, figured the storm did $175,000 in dents, broken windows and other damage to the 18 new and used cars on his lot in Westwego. The car lot was hit by a tornado in 2004. Katrina tore off the roof of his Metairie home and left a foot of water inside.
"Right now, I don't want to live any more," he said. "I don't want to be in this world."
The storm ripped the roof from the 51-room hotel next to Namazi's lot. Owner Stella Lin said 36 rooms were occupied but only minor injuries were reported. ( Watch the scene at the battered hotel )
"Some of the people there at the hotel were still living there from Katrina," Westwego Fire Chief Keith Bouvier said.
Lin said her insurance covered only a tiny fraction of her hurricane losses, and she got that after a "really, really, really big fight."
"Now I have to fight them again," she said.

On Wednesday night, Teterboro Airport was closed after a corporate jet, registered to Jet Services of Las Vegas, slid off the runway while landing. The FAA says the plane veered off the side of a runway a little after 8 p.m. None of the crew or nine passengers on board were hurt.
Meanwhile, the situation is also bad at LaGuardia Airport. Eyewitness News reporter Carolina Tarazona says many people have been stuck at the airport since yesterday at 4:00 p.m. Many were scrambling and hoping to get some information about their flights.
Unfortunately, there is not much good news to report.Because of the hundreds of flights canceled at each airport, there are minimal delays at Newark and Kennedy, however up to an hour delay at LaGuardia.
LaGuardia -- 30 to 60 minute delays
Newark -- scattered delays
Kennedy -- scattered delays "There's basically no delays because there's a lot of cancellations, so the airspace is clear,'' said Marc LaVorgna, a Port Authority spokesman. "The airport is operating fine.'' New York to Washington shuttles were grounded because two Washington airports were closed. And many flights were canceled at Chicago O'Hare International Airport because of snow in the Midwest. LaVorgna advised fliers to check with their carriers. American Airlines reported that most of its flights from the three New York airports this morning have been cancelled.

Adjust font size:
STATE COLLEGE, Pennsylvania (AP) -- Sliding cars and jackknifed trucks snarled highway traffic, and flights were grounded Tuesday as a storm blew out of the Midwest with a threat of up to 2 feet of blowing, drifting snow.
The National Weather Service posted winter storm watches and warnings from Iowa and Missouri across the Ohio Valley into parts of New England.
As the storm plowed eastward, more than 2 inches of snow fell by midday at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while parts of Indiana measured more than 11 inches with drifts up to 6 feet, the weather service said.
Up to 18 inches of snow was forecast for northern Pennsylvania, with a chance of 2 feet at higher elevations.
Twenty-inch accumulations were possible in parts of New York state, where communities on the eastern end of Lake Ontario have endured a week of lake-effect snow that totaled more than 11 feet. (Watch what 141 inches of snow does to a town )
Schools were canceled or delayed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The University of Illinois in Champaign canceled classes for the first time since 1979, and Wednesday's Indiana-Purdue men's basketball game was postponed until Thursday.
The federal government in Washington dismissed most employees at 2 p.m., forcing the area's transit system to adjust its schedule and begin its rush-hour service. The commuter rail line between Washington and Baltimore tried to adjust to the early flood of passengers.
At least four traffic deaths were blamed on the snow and ice -- three in Nebraska and one in Missouri -- and a tornado on the southern side of the huge weather system killed one person in Louisiana. (Full story)
A 9-year-old girl was killed when an ice-covered tree branch fell on her in Ohio.
"I want to get out of here and away from this weather," trucker Terry Kettering of Youngstown, Ohio, said at the Flying J Travel Plaza on the south side of Indianapolis. (Watch Ohio reel from the storm )
Illinois State Police reported whiteout conditions and roads blocked in some places by waist-high drifts.
"It's very dangerous; it's real bad," said Gustavo Chavez, who was at a gas station in Sherman, Illinois, north of Springfield, after paying $200 to have his car pulled from a ditch. "It doesn't stop."
Pennsylvania's two largest airports, at Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, reported no major problems by afternoon.
Elsewhere, however, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, canceled more than 900 flights, airport and airline officials said. Midway Airport canceled about 300 flights. About 20 percent of the flights out of Cincinnati, Ohio's main airport were canceled because of poor conditions elsewhere, spokesmen said.
Ohio state officials said southbound lanes of Interstate 75 in the Dayton area reopened after being closed by jackknifed tractor-trailer rigs.
"People are sliding off everywhere," said Joe Whittaker, emergency management director in west-central Indiana's Fountain County.
Along the southern edge of the snow belt, freezing rain coated roads, tree limbs and power lines with as much as three-quarters of an inch of ice. About 10,500 Duke Energy customers lost power in Indiana by late afternoon, said spokeswoman Angeline Protogere.
Ameren Corp. said about 7,600 customers were without power, mostly in Illinois.
Earlier this month, a stretch of more than a week of bitter cold and slippery roads contributed to at least 25 deaths.

From 1888 to Present (Excluding the mountains of the West and lake-effect snows.)
1) "BLIZZARD OF 1888" March 11-12, 1888 Unseasonable and devastating snowstorm from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine. The cities of Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and New York City were paralyzed. This incredible "Nor'easter" dumped 50 inches of snow in Connecticut and Massachusetts while New Jersey and the state of New York had 40 inches. Drifts of 40 to 50 feet high buried houses and trains. From Chesapeake Bay to Nantucket, 200 ships were sunk with 400 lives lost. 2) "ARMISTICE DAY STORM" November 11-12, 1940 Mild weather ahead of an intense low pressure system tracking from Kansas to western Wisconsin, was quickly followed by a raging blizzard. Many people were caught off-guard by the severity of the storm and particularly the plunging temperatures. Sixty degree temperatures during the morning of the 11th was followed by single digit readings by the morning of the 12th. These very cold temperatures and snow amounts were very unusual for this early in the season. Up to 26 inches of snow fell in Minnesota, while winds of 50 to 80 mph and heavy snows were common over parts of the states of Wisconsin, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and Michigan. These winds were responsible for whipping up 20 foot drifts. A total of 144 deaths were blamed on the storm (13 in Wisconsin), most of which were duck hunters along the Mississippi River. Milwaukee received only a trace of snow, but 80 mph gradient winds downed hundreds of trees. 3) "THE GREAT MIDWEST BLIZZARD" January 26-27, 1967 One of the biggest snowstorms to strike the Midwest on record occurred just two days after an extremely rare January tornado outbreak struck nearly the same area (January 24). An intense "Panhandle hook" storm tracked from New Mexico northeast up the Ohio Valley. Central and northern Illinois, northern Indiana, southeast Iowa, Lower Michigan, Missouri and Kansas were hit hard by this blizzard. Kalamazoo, Michigan reported 28 inches of snow, Gary, Indiana 24 inches and Chicago 23 inches. Winds of 50 mph created drifts to 15 feet! Seventy-six people died, most in the Chicago area. This blizzard still ranks as Chicago's heaviest snowfall in a 24-hour period. (Remarkably, Milwaukee measured only 6 inches of snow from this storm.) 4) "BLIZZARD OF 1978" January 25-27, 1978 A tremendous blizzard struck Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Illinois, western Pennsylvania and southeast Wisconsin. One to three feet of snow was common throughout this area with 50 to 70 mph winds whipping up 10 to 15 foot drifts. Ohio was hardest hit with 100 mph winds and 25 foot drifts! Much of the affected area was paralyzed for several days. This very intense "Lower Mississippi Valley" type storm tracked from Mississippi to Lake Huron and deepened to 960 mb as it neared Detroit, Michigan. Over 70 deaths were blamed on this storm. Milwaukee measured nearly a foot of snow from this large and very intense storm system. 5) "SUPERSTORM OF 1993" (Also dubbed the "Storm of the Century") March 12-13, 1993 This extremely intense and massive storm tracked from the western Gulf of Mexico to the Florida Panhandle and up the eastern seaboard to Massachusetts (lowest pressure at one point was under 960 mb). A huge area had tremendous snow amounts, some of record proportions. This storm dumped the most snow in the largest area than ever before. Amounts ranged from a foot in southern Alabama to over 40 inches in the state of New York. In the mountains along the Tennessee / North Carolina border a whopping 60 inches fell! Winds of 70 mph were common across this large area with drifts to 20 feet high. Nearly 300 deaths were blamed on this storm due to the severity and large area affected. 6) "BLIZZARD OF 2005" January 20-24, 2005 What started out as a clipper system diving into the northern Plains, quickly turned into an unsual type of blizzard as it hit the Lower Great Lakes. The system tapped into Gulf of Mexico moisture as it propagated east southeast across Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and southern Ohio. A weaker clipper system just to it's north passed all of it's energy to the developing storm to the south and subsequently bombed out as it hit the Atlantic. Although not a terribly deep storm, copious amounts of moisture streamed northward from the Gulf Stream and dumped record snowfall totals across southern New England. A large swath of heavy snow blanketed much of the Upper Midwest, northern Ohio Valley, and most of New England. Snowfall totals ranged from 5 to 13 inches across the Midwest (locally 15 to 16 inches near Lake Michigan) to 8 to locally 37 inches across southern New England. Areas around Boston reported snowfall rates of 3 to 5 inches per hour for a time. One nearby city recorded 7 inches of snow in 75 minutes!! Boston officially recorded 22.5 inches, which contributed largely to breaking an all time record for the amount of monthly snowfall (43.3 inches) for any month. In addition to record snowfall, winds gusted in excess of 60 mph across portions of the Midwest and up to 85 mph across portions of southern New England. Widespread white-out conditions resulted, and entire cities were shut down in the northeast. Portions of Massachusetts reported 6 foot snow drifts.""" ;

WASHINGTON — Victims of the major storm affecting several Northeastern states on Monday, April 16 will have two additional days to file their tax returns beyond the April 17 tax deadline, the Internal Revenue Service announced today.
Taxpayers directly impacted by the storm have until midnight April 19 to meet their tax filing obligations without incurring late filing and payment penalties.
Across the Northeast, there have been power outages and public transportation problems making it difficult in some cases, if not impossible, for some taxpayers and tax professionals to meet the April 17 filing deadline.
“Because this unusually forceful storm hit within 24 hours of the filing deadline, we are giving affected taxpayers 48 additional hours,” IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson said.
Affected taxpayers can mark their paper tax returns with the words “April 16 Storm.” Taxpayers who e-file their returns can use their software’s “disaster” feature, if available.
Taxpayers can keep up to date by visiting the IRS.gov Web site and clicking on “Newsroom.”

A local state of emergency has been declared by government officials in Springfield and Greene County, after the first wave of freezing rain and ice sweptthrough the county Friday night.Ryan Nicholls, director of Springfield-Greene County Emergency Management said the governments of Springfield and Greene County had made the jointdecision to declare an emergency. "That means we are maximizing resources to respond to this emergency, but that is not something we can sustain," Nicholls said."We hope this will spur will state send additional resources our way."Ernest Decamp, spokesman for Springfield City Utilities, said 60-70,000 customers were without electricity in the Springfield area by dawn Saturday.Outages were being monitored at CU's emergency center, Decamp said. While crews were busy restoring power to one area, trees were continuing to fall from the weight of ice, causing more outages down the line.Laclede Electric Cooperative reported widespread outages, generally along the 1-44 corridor; Conway to Ft. Leonard Wood, and about 10 miles on either side of the interstation. All crews were working and contractors were being called in to help. Laclede estimated about 12,700 customers without power.Webster Electric said it was still assessing the scope of it's outage, but had a number of broken poles and lines down and reports throughout the county from customers without power.The same was true of Southwest Electric, reporting outages from Aldrich to Bolivar to Buffalo. The outage extended south to I-44 in that coop's system, and is so widespread the provider couldn't say how many customers were affected.Nicholls characterized conditions around the county as "terrible" with debris from downed trees and electric lines, leading to widespread power outages.An emergency shelter was set up at Schweiter Methodist Church in Springfield, after the Salvation Army building lost power. Nicholls urged anyone without power and heat to seek other shelter sooner rather than later, because conditions are not expected to improve through the weekend.Click the video icon above to see some of the damage and power crews at work.""" ;

The power is still out for some 21,000 homes and businesses after the sleet and ice storm earlier this week.
Baltimore Gas and Electric hopes to have almost everyone back on line sometime Friday night.
At 5 p.m., the utility had 8,000 in Anne Arundel County and 3,000 outages in Prince George's County.
More than 130,000 customers have lost electricity since the storm on Wednesday. Nearly 2,000 BGE and out-of-state personnel have been working 12- to 16 hours a day. And BGE's call center has already taken more than 115,000 calls from customers since Wednesday morning.
"Despite the significant progress that we've made restoring service, new outages continued to occur as a result of ongoing wind throughout the day Thursday and into Friday," said BGE Vice President Stephen J. Woerner, in a news release. "We thank our customers for their continued patience and understanding as we work to restore power as quickly and safely as possible."
The utilities are urging you to call them if your electricity goes off, even if you know that your neighbors have already called.

Late in the afternoon of 14 April 1999, an intense supercell thunderstorm formed south of Wollongong. It dumped hail in and around Kiama, Albion Park and Shellharbour around 5pm, but did little damage there. It then moved out to sea and travelled slowly north, but just before 7:30pm it suddenly turned inland near Bundeena and moved through the Sutherland Shire, Botany Bay, the airport and the suburbs in and around the CBD depositing very large hail as it did so. It then tracked north along the northern beaches and finally collapsed near Broken Bay at around 10 pm.
The most serious damage was caused by giant hail between Lilli Pilli on Port Hacking and Darling Point on Sydney Harbour in a band 25km long by 3km wide. Most of the damage was to residential property and vehicles. The total cost is likely to be in the vicinity of $2,200,000,000 making this event almost four times more costly than the giant storm of 1991 over Sydneyâ€™s northern suburbs. It also damaged more than four times the number of properties than that storm.
The April storm was the most costly thunderstorm ever to strike Sydney. Ironically the State Emergency Service (SES), which is the combat agency for severe storms (and floods) was in the process of preparing a State level Sub-Plan to the State Disaster Plan covering severe storms when the hailstorm struck.
The SES was preparing the Plan because all major storms require multi-agency responses. While the cooperation between the emergency services and functional areas has always been excellent, SES had experienced the occasional problem with coordination between the services, particularly following the larger storms. It is also appropriate to keep in mind that storms cause regular major responses from all the Emergency Services. Indeed over the last decade they have been our most costly natural hazard.
The decision to prepare a Storm Plan was therefore reasonable in the circumstances. The pity of it was perhaps that it was not in operation when the storm struck the most densely populated part of Sydney on the evening of 14 April 1999.

Repair crews and homeowners still faced a mixture of snow, sleet and light rain that fell across parts of north Texas and central Oklahoma during the morning.
"It will still be cold and nasty outside and may slow efforts to restore power and remove tree limbs and such," said Patrick Burke, a weather service meteorologist in Norman, Oklahoma.
Sunshine was possible in hard-hit Oklahoma during the afternoon and temperatures could reach the 40s Thursday, the weather service said. By late Friday, however, another storm could bring 2 to 4 inches of snow to parts of the region.
Ice up to 1½ inches thick has glazed much of the central Plains and Midwest this week. At least 27 deaths -- mostly traffic accidents -- have been blamed on the storm system since it developed last weekend. Watch the sights and sounds of massive ice storm »
Outside that affected area, forecasters said more snow, sleet and freezing rain could develop Wednesday across the northern Ohio Valley and into New England. See how dangerous winter precipitation forms »
About 468,000 homes and business still had no power Wednesday in Oklahoma, suffering its worst power outage on record. That was down from a peak of some 618,000 customers Tuesday, but utility officials said it could be a week to 10 days before power is fully restored.
"We're relying on people to look after each other," Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said. "At the end of the day, this comes down to the strength of your people. ... People who have electricity ought to be sharing it with people who don't."
Elsewhere, around 208,000 customers were still blacked out in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska. Some schools in southern Iowa canceled classes Wednesday for a second day.
Lesley Owczarski, owner of Big Apple Bagels in Ottumwa, Iowa, said the power was on at her shop Tuesday, but many of her customers weren't so lucky.
"Most of the places don't have power so a lot of people have been coming to the bagel shop," she said. "If they can come in and get warm and have a hot coffee and a latte, why not? I can understand it's boring sitting at home."
Most people decided to stay home and bundle up rather than go to shelters.
"We've got kerosene lamps and a fireplace," said Charita Miller of Oklahoma City. "We're OK. We can't watch TV. Oh well, you can't have everything. It's just me and my husband. My husband said `There's food in the freezer."'
Sonya Kendrick, who spent Monday night at one of several American Red Cross shelters set up in Oklahoma City, said a tree ripped the electrical box off the side of her house, and she needed a warm place for her three children.
"When I got in here yesterday, I was totally distraught. I was like 'Why me? Why me of all people?' I look at it this way, too: I'm not the only one," Kendrick said Tuesday. "There's other people here that I got to know in less than two days, literally. All of them have been through the same thing, and everybody here just understands everybody."
The weather also has caused extensive travel problems since the weekend. More than 550 flights were canceled Tuesday at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, and hundreds of other flights were delayed up to an hour by nighttime, said Chicago Department of Aviation spokesman Gregg Cunningham.
Officials in Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma had declared states of emergency. President Bush declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma on Tuesday, ordering government aid to supplement state and local efforts. See photos of the storm » E-mail to a friend

The latest storm's northward shift as it moved east meant the brunt of the bad weather was passing through Kansas and Missouri, where, along with Oklahoma, hundreds of thousands of people were still in the dark.
The National Weather Service canceled heavy snow warnings for Oklahoma early Saturday. In the central part of the state, the system brought only light rain during the night instead of the 2 to 4 inches of snow that had been forecast.
Meanwhile, a mixture of snow and freezing rain was expected to thrust into the Mid-Atlantic region and southern New England later Saturday and into Sunday. Watch what's in store for the East Coast »
The Northeast is still digging out from heavy snow Thursday that caused monumental transportation problems. See photos of the Northeastern storm »
A storm last weekend coated much of the Plains in ice before dumping snow on the Northeast. It killed at least 38 people, mostly in traffic accidents, including 23 people in Oklahoma alone.
At its height, a million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri were blacked out. Crews worked Friday to restore power to 280,000 homes and businesses that were still in the dark, but the latest storm could complicate those efforts.
An Xcel Energy serviceman working in an Oklahoma City neighborhood peppered by toppled trees said Friday he expected the new storm to hamper recovery efforts but not create massive new power failures.
"All this kind of work is safety-based, so any time you get another weather aspect, then there goes another safety factor," said Scott Falkner of Clovis, New Mexico.
National Weather Service meteorologist Pete Snyder agreed with that assessment.
"For crews that are out there trying to restore power, it'd be more of a headache," Snyder said.
Bill Weaver, a Tulsa resident who moved to Oklahoma City two years ago to escape hurricane-battered New Orleans, Louisiana, waited in his frigid home Friday for the electricity to be turned back on, deadpanning: "So, here we are."
He had two gas-log fireplaces going, warming about a third of his home.
"It doesn't keep the showers warm," Weaver said. "It's cold baths."
Earlier in the week, President Bush declared a disaster emergency in Oklahoma, which freed resources to respond to the storm. Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry said Friday that he plans to seek a major disaster declaration, which would provide assistance for individuals and local governments.
The latest storm was expected to dump heavy snow on parts of the Plains before tapering off late Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. See how winter storms form »

Motorists slid off roads as the storm cut visibility and iced over highways with drifts, sleet and freezing rain. The National Weather Service posted winter storm warnings from Michigan, which could get 14 inches of snow in some areas, to Indiana and all the way to Maine.
About a foot of snow had fallen in parts of Chicago and Ann Arbor, Michigan, with 10 inches in Vermont.
"Our biggest advice right now is stay home," said Maine State Police Sgt. Andrew Donovan.
Visibility in the blowing snow was less than 200 yards, and in stronger gusts "if there's a car in front of you, you can't even see it," he said.
Every available plow truck was at work in Vermont, said Reggie Brown, highway department dispatcher in Montpelier. "Everybody's out and running," he said.
Illinois Department of Transportation spokesman Mike Claffey said 1,000 trucks were out clearing snow Sunday.
Snow depths in some places were uncertain. "They can't tell how much because it's blowing so hard," Brown said.
"I don't mind an inch or two, but this is too much," said Larry Thelen in Ann Arbor.
The Hancock County Sheriff's Office in northwestern Ohio declared roads off limits to nonemergency vehicles, threatening anyone else traveling through the county with arrest. Wind gusts as high as 40 mph blew snow around and diminished visibility.
The storm canceled hundreds of flights at airports in Chicago, where Midway Airport measured 10 inches of snow Sunday morning. In Maine, most of Portland International Jetport's inbound and outbound flights were canceled, said city Transportation Director Jeff Monroe. Numerous flights were canceled at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. See how winter storms form »
Many churches called off Sunday services because of the hazardous driving conditions.
"I don't want folks to venture out because we're having church and they feel obligated," the Rev. Glenn Mortimer said after calling off services at Wakefield-Lynnfield United Methodist Church in Wakefield, Massachusetts.
He noted that some people still hadn't completely dug out from Thursday's storm that dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of Massachusetts. Watch a 'winter wonderland' in Boston »

The storm didn't keep fans away from the New England Patriots vs. New York Jets game at Foxborough, Massachusetts, but they had to shovel off their seats in the stadium. A video of a fire roaring in a fireplace was shown on the scoreboards at both ends of the field.
At Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, strong winds collapsed a fabric dome used for hospitality events before and after games. No one was inside or hurt when the structure fell Sunday morning.
And in Buffalo, New York, the weather didn't deter Bills fans who rose early for a bus trip to Cleveland for a game against the Browns.
"Rain, snow, sleet, whatever, we'll be there," Brian Kras said, boarding a chartered bus at 5:30 a.m.
During the Bills and Browns game Sunday a severe storm pounded the Lake Erie shoreline with heavy snow and intense winds. The temperature was 30 degrees at kickoff, and with wind gusts hitting 40 mph, Browns Stadium was transformed into a super-sized snow globe. Browns huddled for warmth near space heaters by their bench.
Unable to get any traction, players slipped all over the field and officials had difficulty spotting the ball in the blustery conditions. Punts and passes were adventures as anything not grounded was quickly blown off-target.
During the first quarter, stadium groundskeepers did their best to keep the yard lines, sidelines and hashmarks visible, but as soon as they completed one attempt, they had to start another to keep up with the snow.
The storm also didn't stand in the way of dedicated Christmas shoppers.
"The reason we came out in the storm early, early, is that we knew there would be no lines," Michael McGrath, 48, of Boston, said as he stomped along partly shoveled downtown sidewalks. "It was true. The stores were empty."
Betty Gould and Rocky Castellano drove about 20 miles from Pittsfield, New Hampshire, to Steeplegate Mall in Concord, New Hampshire.
Asked if she considered staying home, Gould said: "Never."
"We like the snow," Gould said. "He thinks he's invincible. He has four-wheel drive, studded tires, the whole bit."
Instead of church, Paul Milner of Chittenango, New York, went to a neighborhood grocery market to stock up.
"The roads weren't bad. But they say there's more on the way. Guess that shouldn't be any surprise in upstate New York in mid-December," he said.
Slippery roads were blamed for two traffic deaths in Michigan and one in Wisconsin.
More than 100,000 customers were blacked out Sunday in parts of Pennsylvania, utilities reported. Scattered outages caused by heavy snow and freezing rain also were reported in Vermont, state officials said.
The storm came less than a week after an ice storm blamed for at least 38 deaths, mostly in traffic accidents, in the middle of the country. Thousands of homes and business still had no electricity in parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. E-mail to a friend

• Airports report dozens of flight cancellations
• Storm expected to move east during weekend
• Power supply, road travel could be affected
Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry has declared a statewide state of emergency as a brutal ice storm moves into the U.S. heartland.
"We're taking these actions so that the state will be in the best possible position to respond to the storm," Henry said in a statement issued Friday. "I would urge all Oklahomans to exercise extreme caution if they have to venture outside."
Millions of people in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and eastern Missouri were being warned that conditions would deteriorate Friday afternoon and evening, and the storm could spread as far east as Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend.
"This is a one-in- maybe 15- to 25-year event," CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers said Friday of the forecast freezing rain, sleet and snow. (Watch the forces at work to create this storm )
"The big story will be how many roads are shut down, airports are shut down and how many power lines are down because of the ice this weekend," Myers added.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, up to St. Louis, Missouri, could see "devastating consequences," Myers warned Friday. "You won't be able to get in or out of St. Louis tomorrow."
In Oklahoma City, Interstate 40 will most likely shut down, he said.
Drivers already have had trouble on the roads there, with a truck slipping and flipping over, Oklahoma City TV station KWTV reported. One person was killed in that accident, it said.
The city's Will Rogers World Airport already was seeing cancellations by Friday morning. As of noon, United, Continental, Northwest, American, Southwest and British Airways had reported cancellations, according to the airport's Web site.
Tulsa International Airport also reported more than a dozen cancellations by noon.
Rain is expected to fall through cold air coming from Canada and develop into ice, Myers said.
Significant ice accumulations were expected Saturday night and Sunday across the Texas Panhandle through southern Oklahoma, according to the National Weather Service.
Parts of central Oklahoma could see ice from a quarter-inch to a half-inch thick Friday, the weather service warned, adding that bridges, overpasses and sidewalks could become especially hazardous.
Ice storm warnings already were in effect for western, central and far northeastern Oklahoma through Sunday evening. Much of the state would also fall under a winter storm watch Friday afternoon, meaning that sleet, ice and snow could affect travel. A freezing-rain advisory and a flash-flood watch were also in effect in parts of the state.
The National Weather Service strongly discouraged travel in the areas covered by ice storm warnings, noting that downed power lines and fallen tree branches could pose dangers to drivers. In the event driving is necessary, people should keep an extra flashlight, food and water in the vehicle in case of emergency, the weather service advised.
Freezing rain was also forecast for southeast Kansas into central Missouri Friday and was expected to hit Interstate 44 by late Friday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.
Ice up to three-quarters of an inch will be likely by Saturday morning, and some parts -- including the metropolitan St. Louis area -- could see ice accumulations of an inch and a half by Sunday, all of which could mean widespread power outages, the weather service said.
In the week ahead, parts of Oklahoma will have highs in the 20s and lows in the teens and possibly single digits, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.
In addition to the central United States, a cold snap also was predicted this weekend for California, where farmers were preparing to monitor the health of a nearly $1 billion citrus crop, The Associated Press reported. (Full story)

How a free Rolling Stones concert turned into a colossal mass bad trip -- and spawned the most harrowing rock 'n' roll movie ever made. - - - - - - - - - - - -
By Michael Sragow Aug. 10, 2000 | Thirty years after its original release, "Gimme Shelter" remains a red-hot paradox: an exhilarating sober-upper. When it reopens at the Film Forum in New York Friday, it will once again ignite audiences with sinuous yet explosive concert numbers from the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour, when Mick Jagger was at his jangly prime. But it frames those performances with pictures of Jagger in front of a film viewer, watching footage of the '69 tour, the dealings that created a free concert on Dec. 6 of that year at the isolated Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., and the band's embattled appearance there before a freaked-out crowd and a violent clutch of Hells Angels. At the soul-shriveling climax, a knife flashes -- and a murder unspools on-screen. The image is so blunt and Jagger's response to it so shrouded or implacable, that the film becomes disturbing in an almost primordial way.
Print story
E-mail story Backflip this story to find it again In the rock dishonor roll that includes the Who concert in Cincinnati in 1979 and Pearl Jam in Roskilde, Denmark, this year, no name flashes out more luridly than Altamont. At Altamont, even a star -- Jefferson Airplane lead singer Marty Balin -- was knocked out. With 850 injured, two dead in a hit-and-run, another drowned and an 18-year-old black man slain by a Hells Angel, Altamont was awful enough to have arbiters of hipness call for the kids of Woodstock Nation to be put in stocks. The making of -- and response to -- the film of the concert, "Gimme Shelter," proved to be just as tumultuous: It drew the most dynamic rock stars, rock writers, documentary-makers and movie critics of its era into an intellectual mosh pit. The story of this movie and its discontents is a pop-cultural saga that stars Jagger and Pauline Kael and Vincent Canby; Haskell Wexler and Greil Marcus and Stanley Booth; and includes cameos from the likes of George Lucas and Walter Murch. The way the film's three directors -- David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin -- shape the material, the movie is a tribute to the Stones as popular artists wrapped inside a cautionary tale for the counterculture. The filmmakers crystallize the jagged contradictions that gave rise to an epochal fiasco. From the start, the atmosphere is ripe for catastrophe. The entire enterprise is all too willful. There's something perilously off about the blend of the Stones' zonked brand of superstar noblesse oblige, fabled attorney Melvin Belli's high-powered maneuvering on behalf of the group and the surrounding attempts at seat-of-the-pants, grass-roots organizing. When disaster strikes and strikes again -- first with the Angels' leaded pool cues, later with the flaunting of a gun and the slice of that knife -- it's doubly excruciating because we see it coming. Zwerin and the Maysles slow the moment of the murder down for Jagger (and for us) on an editing table. The shot is shadowy and we know we're not getting the whole story. But the harrowing context gives the deadly scene an apocalyptic stature. It's part of a colossal, mass bad trip. - - - - - - - - - - - - When "Gimme Shelter" was released, some of the country's most powerful reviewers disparaged it. They said it was exploitative, too small for the subject -- even, since the Stones financed part of it, a made-to-order job designed to restore the group's tarnished reputation. "The great critics of that period got so caught up in the cultural moment that they missed the movie," charges Peter Becker. He's the director of the Criterion Collection -- the company that will release "Gimme Shelter" on DVD and that, along with Janus Films and Home Vision Cinema, spearheaded the theatrical re-release. "[The New Yorker's] Pauline Kael and [the New York Times'] Vincent Canby led the charge against 'Gimme Shelter' as an opportunistic snuff film, essentially saying that the filmmakers were complicit in the murder by having photographed it and subsequently profited from its theatrical release." The central charge was that the concert was staged specifically to be filmed -- and irresponsibly so. While conceding that the filmmakers had caught Jagger's "feral intensity" with acute "editing of the images to the music," Kael said that "the filmed death at Altamont" was part of a "cinéma vérité spectacular." She condemned the movie with rhetorical questions: "If events are created to be photographed, is the movie that records them a documentary, or does it function in a twilight zone? Is it the cinema of fact when the facts are manufactured for the cinema?" (Kael is an old friend of mine. When I told her that her original review was still, in Albert Maysles' words, a "thorn in his side," she cheerfully remarked, "Tough shit!") Canby panned the film, under the title "Making Murder Pay": in another New York Times piece Albert Goldman complained that the movie "really uses its brightly colored footage whitewash the Rolling Stones, who must share some of the responsibility for the disaster and who also, as it happens, are the people who hired the filmmakers." Arthur Schlesinger Jr. chided the movie in Vogue. It was, he said, "unduly protective, not just of the Stones but of the Woodstock myth of the young." And a few years later, in 1976, Marcus, by then a book columnist at Rolling Stone, wrote that "the Stones were shown as victims, as if the purpose of the film was not to deal with real events, but to absolve those who paid for the film of any responsibility for those events."

Previous major ice storms in the region, notably December 1986 in Ottawa and February 1961 in Montreal, deposited between 30 and 40 mm of ice - about half the thickness from the 1998 storm event! The extent of the area affected by the ice was enormous. Freezing precipitation is often described as 'a line of' or 'spotty occurrences of'. At the peak of the storm, the area of freezing precipitation extended from Muskoka and Kitchener in Ontario through eastern Ontario, western Quebec and the Eastern Townships to the Fundy coasts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the United States, icing coated Northern New York and parts of New England.
What made the ice storm so unusual though, was that it went on for so long. On average, Ottawa and Montreal receive freezing precipitation on 12 to 17 days a year. Each episode generally lasts for only a few hours at a time, for an annual average total between 45 to 65 hours. During Ice Storm'98, it did not rain continuously, however; the number of hours of freezing rain and drizzle was in excess of 80 - again nearly double the normal annual total.
Unlucky too! The storm brutalized one of the largest populated and urbanized areas of North America leaving more than four million people freezing in the dark for hours, if not, days. Without question, the storm directly affected more people than any previous weather event in Canadian history. Into the third week following the onset of the storm, more than 700,000 were still without electricity. Had the storm tracked 100 km farther east or west of its main target, the disruptive effect would have been far less crippling.

VIDEO: Sydney's eerie orange sky Sydneysiders awoke to a blanket of thick orange haze this morning after dust swept in from South Australia. 09/09 Sky News
The dust cloud covers almost the whole of NSW, after an extreme low pressure system moved across the state from central Australia and western NSW.The dust caused commuter chaos, the cancellation of flights from Sydney Airport, the closure of the M5 tunnel and the suspension of Sydney ferries.People with respiratory illnesses were told to stay indoors and health authorities advised people to avoid exercise until the dust cleared.The Bureau of Meteorology's Regional Director for New South Wales Barry Hanstrum said visibility at Sydney Airport had dropped as low as 400m.“An event like this is extremely rare,” Mr Hanstrum said. “It's one of the worst, if not the worst.”The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds in Sydney with a gale warning issued for Sydney closed waters.Wild winds are lashing the Hunter region and gale force winds of up to 100km/h are expected to hit Sydney.Mr Hanstrum said hail stones reportedly as big as cricket balls hit the town of Crookwell near Goulburn last night.In the state's west visibility was reduced to just 10 metres in Broken Hill.A Sydney Airport spokesman said a combination of strong cross winds and low visibility would lead to flight delays throughout the day.“We're operating in low visibility conditions due to strong winds and dust haze,” he said.“Departure and arrivals delays will be experienced at both Sydney and domestic and international airports.Sydney icons such as the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House took on a ghostly appearance.Armed with his camera at Circular Quay, Manly resident Alec Wagstaff, who was forced to catch the bus to the city after the ferries cancelled, said he relished the chance to photograph the tourist attractions in a different light.“I woke up and there was this unbelievable golden hue,” Mr Wagstaff said.“It is really interesting light, it's going to be quite a challenge.”“I haven't seen this since Adelaide 30 to 40 years ago.”Police urged motorists drive with caution reporting heavy traffic and low visibility.City-bound lanes of the M5 tunnel have now been reopened after the Roads and Traffic Authority advised drivers to use King Georges Road.The State Emergency Services have received almost 200 requests for assistance across the state.The dusty conditions are expected to last throughout the morning.Additional reporting: AAP""" ;

A TEAM of Australian scientists are analysing the dust that has engulfed eastern Australia this week to see whether it is dangerous.
The dust storm is believed to have originated around Woomera in outback South Australia near the massive Olympic Dam uranium mine, prompting fears it was radioactive and dangerous.
Climatologist Professor Nigel Tapper, from Melbourne's Monash University, played down the risks to humans but said the dust might threaten important eco-systems such as the Great Barrier Reef.
"Certainly the dust storm could have potentially come from those outback areas, we believe it has mainly come from dry lake and creek beds and elsewhere in the Lake Eyre basin," he said.
"That (radioactive) stuff has been spread around over a long time so I would not have thought there would be much of an issue around that.
"The main concern is over fine dust that goes right into the lungs triggering asthma and other respiratory problems."
The scientists were analysing dust that had been blown 2150km to New Zealand and "fingerprinting" it, and its minerals, to find out where it came from and if it was a threat to the Coral Sea and agriculture.
Although it is not unusual for smoke particles to cross the Tasman, meteorologists said the arrival of Australian dust was a rare occurrence.
Dust blown from Africa is believed to have similarly damaged coral reefs in the Caribbean, Prof Tapper said.
"Our preliminary tests show materials are getting there and we have identified where it has come from but the biologists will look at the microbes and bacteria there and if it is causing impacts," he said.
"The coral reef is already affected by El Nino (warmer ocean), if it quickly becomes cool or hot and all sorts of such as run-off and different star fish."
Academy Award nominated documentary maker David Bradbury, who has made films about nuclear power, warned about the risks from radioactive dust near the Olympic mine yesterday.
Australian scientist Peter Cosier has also claimed poor land management had made Australia less resistant to dust storms, with another event predicted to hit Sydney this weekend and the drought being blamed for the dust.
The dust storm has been recorded as breaking air particle concentration levels and reaching 15,400 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Normal days register up to 20 micrograms and bushfires generate 500 micrograms.
Meteorologist Philip Duncan of the WeatherWatch website said orange dust falls had been reported in the North Island districts of Auckland, Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki.
It was clearly visible where it landed, particularly on car windows.
"It arrived yesterday afternoon but was caught up in the rain and cloud associated with the front. Now that the skies are clearing it's quite evident," Mr Duncan said yesterday.
A Taranaki resident told the website the dust was so thick at the school where he worked it would not wash away in heavy showers.""" ;

Dust clouds that caused havoc around South-East Queensland today are beginning to clear.
Sam Terry from The Weather Company said at 4.30pm visibility at Brisbane Airport had returned to 1800m, after dropping as low as 200m at midday. A normal reading is in the vicinity of 25,000m.
"Brisbane is just on the western tip of this band, so most of it has actually moved across off shore. I wouldn't think it would last much longer. You'll see it really abate over the next hour," Mr Terry said.
"By tomorrow morning, you won't even remember it - apart from cars being dusty."
Today, construction workers at hundreds of South-East Queensland building sites walked off the job while Eagle Farm race track was forced to cancel its scheduled meeting.
Pharmacies were inundated with requests for face masks, although medical experts have played down health concerns related to the dust storm.

Dust storms turn Sydney red
------------------------------------
At its fiercest, the storm reportedly dumped 16,000 tonnes of dirt every hour over South-East Queensland.
Whipped up by strong westerly winds over central Australia, the dust prompted traffic authorities to erect warning signs on highways and major roads into the CBD amid fears of nose-to-tail accidents.
While Brisbane Airport was monitoring the situation closely, no flights had to be cancelled or rerouted due to the storm here.
However, because of the severity of the dust storm that hit Sydney this morning, no flights left Brisbane for the NSW capital until after 9am, creating a backlog that took much of the day to clear.
Dust poses little danger: expert
Brisbane respiratory medical expert Dr Simon Bowler this morning downplayed the potential effects on asthma sufferers.
The Mater Hospital respiratory physician said air-borne pollutants were more likely to cause respiratory problems for asthma sufferers than ground dust.
"By and large dust that's from the ground is relatively inert and for most people it's not a particular drama," Dr Bowler told ABC Radio.
"It's fairly uncommon to see a lot of respiratory problems with wind-blown dust. Paradoxically in Brisbane asthma tends to be a whole lot worse when the skies are clear, because that means there are particularly westerly winds blowing and asthma is much worse under those circumstances."
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Tony Auden said this morning a red blanket had reduced visibility on the Darling Downs to 100 metres.
"This is one of the thickest dust storms I've seen for at least three or four years," he said.
He said the cloud blowing from the red centre yesterday had caused severe dust storms in Sydney, although the effects could be short-lived here.
"We should see conditions slowly improve into the afternoon and the dust settle out as the front moves through the south-east."
Dust clouds whipped up by strong winds blanketed Sydney this morning, casting a strange red pall over the city.
"The reason for the dust is we had some really strong winds in the inland areas of NSW and in South Australia for a sustained period yesterday," said Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Jane Golding.
"That's lifted a whole lot of dust off the ground because it's quite dry out there, many of those areas are still drought affected."
The lifted dust was carried by the winds into Sydney.
"I've not seen anything like this before."
The reddish haze was expected to fade as the sun got higher in the sky, Ms Golding said, but it was not known what would happen to the dust.
"This is such an infrequent event ... it's hard to say when the dust will stop."

Have you ever heard the phrase: "If a butterfly flaps its wings in Mexico, it will create a tornado in Minnesota"? The idea behind this is that even the small features may have dramatic impacts on the weather down the road - it's called chaos theory. The reason for that small rant is because at some point in the early part of October, a weak disturbance formed in the Pacific Ocean which eventually grew into typhoon (hurricane) that caused some major problems in Japan. Take a look at this image taken by a NASA satellite last week (October 7th) of typhoon Melor as it was approaching the southern islands of Japan:
At 3pm (Tokyo time) Melor had sustained winds of near 100mph with gusts of up to 120mph. Interestingly, this is the same storm that is now battering the west coast of the United States:
Can you believe that this storm made it across the entire Pacific Ocean:
California appears to be getting hit the worst, here are some of the storm impacts:
Impulses from the main storm are being flung east-northeastward over the Rockies and through the woods - and to grandmothers house it goes... These weaker storms tend to get ripped apart as they make their way over the higher elevations, so we (here in Minnesota) will get the left-overs. Unlike earlier this week, accumulating snow will be harder to find through central and southern Minnesota because temperatures in the lowest mile of the atmosphere will be slightly warmer. Latest computer runs show a little over 0.50" of liquid rain through Friday morning.
Todd's Outlook for greater St. Cloud
Wednesday: Light rain/snow mix possible. High: 40
Wednesday Night: Rain/snow mix lingers. Low: 34
Thursday: Spotty light rain/snow showers continue. High: 41
Friday: Mostly cloudy with spotty rain showers, still cold. High: 43

Just days before Christmas, the eastern seaboard from North Carolina to New England was digging out from the worst blizzard in years, which closed train and bus service, paralyzed air traffic, crippled motorists and left hundreds of thousands of residents without power in some areas.
Americans pining for a white Christmas got more than they bargained for, with local officials urging residents to hunker down indoors as record snowfall wreaked havoc on roadways.
And with the roads and transportation in disarray, many churches canceled Sunday services and some schools planned closures ahead of the December 25 holiday.
Commuters faced uncertainty on Monday, as the region struggled to clear persistent snow and ice. Federal agencies and local jurisdictions were closed, with all workers except emergency employees excused from work.
In Washington, crews worked throughout the night to restore service to the Metrorail system, de-icing tracks and digging train cars out of the snow in rail yards.
The storm was a blow to the already reeling retail sector, which had been counting on cash registers ringing loudly on "Super Saturday" -- traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year -- to make up for weeks of lackluster sales.
"I think we can safely say that sales in the Washington region were crippled," National Retail Federation vice president Ellen Davis told AFP.
Davis, whose industry group represents retailers across the United States, said because of the inclement weather, "people weren't eating at restaurants, there wasn't any impulse buying."
The last Saturday before Christmas usually rakes in some 15 billion dollars of all nationwide sales. Shoppers seeking to make up for lost time in the Northeast -- home to around a quarter of the US population -- found more closed stores, unplowed roads and limited transportation options on Sunday.
Airports in the Washington area, which woke up Sunday swathed in a deep white blanket under clear skies, limped back to operation and said it would take some time to reestablish normalcy.
"It's going to take a few days for the airlines to re-book everybody, so if anybody was planning to travel, they really need to check with their airline before they head out to the airport," said spokeswoman Courtney Mickalonis at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
The storm brought chaos to the annual year-end holiday travel season that officially began Saturday and lasts two weeks, through the New Year holiday.
As the monster storm barreled northward, the National Weather Service said snow across the Mid-Atlantic and New England states was slowly tapering off as it moved away from the coast.
Blizzard and winter storm warnings were discontinued after the weather system dumped over two feet (61 centimeters) in some parts of Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey and New York.
The storm at one point stretched some 500 miles (800 kilometers) across 14 states, affecting tens of millions of Americans.
The weather service said it was the heaviest snow storm ever to hit the US capital in December. A total of 16 inches (41 cm) accumulated in Washington, where snow does not usually fall until January or later, if at all.
Three people died on Virginia roads Saturday as some 3,000 accidents shut down interstate highways for several hours, according to the state's department of emergency management. The Virginia Department of Health confirmed one other storm-related death.
Bus service around the region was severely hampered, and suspended in places, hours after the storm had passed.
"There are huge piles of snow lining the edges of streets and blocking the bus stops," said John Catoe, general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Rather than deferring their holiday purchases, Davis said, resourceful shoppers likely would try to make up for lost time in the final few shopping days before Christmas, which falls on Friday.
"You might see more people choose to purchase gift cards," she said.
"I would imagine there were people online all day yesterday as opposed to being out" at the shopping malls.""" ;

We continue to be deeply saddened by the tragedy in Duisburg. We had imagined a happy and peaceful celebration for young people. It ended differently. The catastrophe, which has cost so many young people their lives, casts a shadow over the European Capital of Culture RUHR.2010. Our thoughts are with the victims' friends and relatives and with everyone who has suffered physical or psychological damage as a result of this tragic incident.
While the Loveparade took place under the banner of the European Capital of Culture, it was organized by Lopavent in Duisburg, which carries exclusive responsibility for the event. This huge open air music festival has already drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors to Essen and Dortmund in 2007 and 2008. Because RUHR.2010 wants to show that the Ruhr Metropolis is attractive for young people in particular, we supported the idea of the event.
RUHR.2010's next major event will be a performance of Mahler's 8th Symphony on September 12, in which all choirs and orchestras of the Ruhr region will participate. This will include an appropriate commemoration of the tragedy. Furthermore, RUHR.2010's ongoing programme will address the events of Duisburg, especially at activities geared towards young people.
The family and friends of those killed or injured are now at the core of our thoughts, actions and feelings. They are all entitled to a complete explanation of what has happened and who was responsible.

Loveparade: "The Art of Love" brings electrifying beats to Duisburg
Loveparade - The Art of Love / Photo: Lopavent GmbH
The Loveparade transforms Duisburg into the capital city of electronic beats: Elite international DJs take to the turntables on 24 July, including the worldfamous Tiesto and David Guetta. The biggest party in the world gets started at 2 pm when the loudspeakers on the 16 floats flood the Duisburg Güterbanhof with the beats and bass of the new anthem "The Art of Love".
Named as always after the Loveparade's annual motto, the anthem has been written for the first time by DJ and music producer Anthony Rother. In future the anthem will be composed by a different DJ each year. The makers of the Loveparade will thus be giving numerous very popular DJs the chance to make their very own sylistic impression on the event.
DJs on two stages
The closing rally begins at 5 pm and ends at midnight. The stage is located in front of the buildings of the former freight depot close to the city's main railway station. The industrial charm of this backdrop matches perfectly to the musical culture of the Loveparade; the stage design and light projections will cause the stage and the buildings to appear as one. A highlight is an appearance by Elektro Orchestral, where classical music and electro meet for the first time at the Loveparade: DJ Guido Schneider plays live while accompanied by the Berlin Revue Orchestra from the Berlin Admiralspalast as conducted by Mark Scheibe. The line-up on the Main Stage includes, among others; Tiesto, David Guetta, Booka Shade, Anthony Rother, Westbam, Fedde Le Grand and Tiefschwarz. New is a second stage - the Love Stage - where DJs including Moguai, Moonbootica and Felix Kröcher will take place at their turntables from 3 pm until midnight. It will be located at the south end of the grounds and is embedded into an LED wall of 50 square-metres in size.
Floats from six countries
Over ten hours long, the floats will circle the buildings of the freight terminal. Once the closing rally begins at 5 pm by the main stage, trucks approaching the stage area will take up the sound signal from the main stage. As soon as they move away again, the floats resume with their own music. The floats come from the following countries: Brazil, Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, and Germany. This year there are no limits on the creative design of the floats - there are no bridges (height restrictions) or road signs to get in the way.

Overcrowding at the entrance tunnel to the "Love Parade" techno event has been blamed for the tragedy.
A police investigation is underway to establish exactly what happened.
At least half of the victims are believed to be young women who were trampled to death.
The festival, which police said drew 1.4 million people, was not immediately cancelled because authorities feared an abrupt halt could spark a second panic.
British DJ Mark Knight said he was ordered to play on as the incident was dealt with.
"The organisers were quite adamant," he said. "They've been in liaison with the authorities and the stance that they're taking is we really cannot make people aware of it for fear of more panic.
"So we had to keep playing which was very odd."
Organisers finally called the event off late into the evening after news of the deaths.
"There were piles of injured on the ground, some being resuscitated, others dead and covered with sheets," said Isabel Schloesser, 18.
"It was way too full in the afternoon, everybody wanted to get in," she said after leaving the rubble-strewn entrance.
Echoes of a throbbing bass beat could still be heard more than three hours after the crush.
Rescue work was initially hampered by the huge crowds attending the event - one of Europe's biggest electronic music festivals.
People flocked from all around Europe, most in the 18-25 age bracket.
Police in the industrial Ruhr city of Duisburg in western Germany had tried to close the tunnel entrance about a half an hour before the chaos broke out in late afternoon.
"Apparently some tried to enter the area by climbing a fence along a ramp and then fell," the head of an emergency task force, Wolfgang Rabe, said on ARD television.
"It is still a presumption at the moment, but this could have caused a panic."
North Rhine-Westphalia state interior minister Ralf Jaeger arrived at the scene in the evening and said 5,500 police and emergency workers had been mobilised.
German President Christian Wulff expressed sympathy in a statement and Chancellor Angel Merkel sent a message of condolence to the relatives of the victims.
"These young people went to party and instead found death and injury. I am appalled and saddened by so much suffering and pain," she said.
Authorities put the death toll at 18, with at least 80 more injured, many severely.
No further details were immediately available about the dead, which earlier police reports said included nine women and six men.
A doctor from the nearby Johanniter hospital said some 20 to 30 more people were badly injured.
Police earlier tried to resuscitate some with CPR inside the 200-metre long tunnel.
Live images from WDR television showed thousands of revellers streaming out of the festival towards the main train station as rescue helicopters circled overhead.
The annual event featuring electronic dance music such as House, Trance and Techno, flamboyant outfits and energetic dance moves, was first held in Berlin in 1989.
It aims to promote peace through music.
Internationally, similar Love Parades have taken place in Zurich, San Francisco, Mexico City, Acapulco, Vienna, Cape Town, Tel Aviv, Sydney, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, Oslo and Budapest.
Organisers could not immediately be reached for comment. Police said an investigation had already begun.""" ;

Updated August 2010
Tombalbaye's one party state (1962-1975)
The Constitution of 1962 established a one party state with President Ngarta (François) Tombalbaye's Parti Progressiste du Tchad - Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (PPP-RDA; Chadian Progressive Party - African Democratic Rally) as the sole legal party, but disaffection led to the outbreak of an insurgency in 1965 that escalated into a civil war (Römer 1999, 221, 222; Nunley 2007). To mobilise support Tombalbaye initiate direct presidential elections in 1969 and transformed the PPP-RDA into the Mouvement National pour la Révolution Culturelle et Sociale (MNRCS) in 1973 (Römer 1999, 221; Nunley 2007). In April 1975 Tombalbaye was killed in a military coup and the MNRCS was suppressed (Römer 1999, 222).

Military government and peace efforts (1975-1982)
The military government, led by General Felix Malloum, was unable to suppress the rebels, but a peace initiative in 1977 led to the adoption of a transitional arrangement governed by the Acte fondimentale and Hissène Habré was designated Prime Minister (Römer 1999, 222). Habré attempted a coup in February 1979, resulting in the renewal of the civil war (Römer 1999, 222). Further efforts at a negotiated settlement resulted in the installation of insurgent General Goukouni Weddeye as transitional President in late 1979, but Habré's rebel forces defeated those of the government in July 1982 and he became president in October (Römer 1999, 222).
Era of Habré (1982-1990)
To secure his position Habré launched the Union nationale pour l'indépendence et la révolution (UNIR; National Union for Independence and Revolution) in 1984 and in December 1989 held a referendum on a new constitution to legitimise his rule, which was endorsed by 99.9% of voters (Römer 1999, 222, 223; Nunley 2007). Subsequent non-party National Assembly elections were held in July 1990, but the powerlessness of the new National Assembly frustrated the opposition and Habré was overthrown in a coup in December led by the Mouvement patriotique de salut (MPS, Patriotic Salvation Movement) of Idriss Déby Itno (Römer 1999, 223).

The transition to democracy (1990-1996)
Although Déby's interim charter declared the MPS the sole legal party, liberalisation measures were introduced. These included the introduction of political party plurality in October 1991 and the convening of a National Conference in 1993 that adopted a new charter outlining transitional structures and a constitutional formulating mechanism (Römer 1999, 223). A new Constitution was drafted that was ratified by the electorate in a 1996 Constitutional referendum.

As customary, they made their way to the pierhead weatherglass. It had never been so low, forcasting severe storms to come. There was much discussion as to wether they should set sail or not but the men had families to provide for, and it being such “a grand day”, they decided to take the risk. Picking up their heavy seaboots, sou’westers and “doppers” (oilskins) they prepared to sail.
It was a point of honour that if one boat sailed the rest of the fleet were obliged to follow, so around 8am watched by onlookers and families, 45 boats set off in tight formation, fanning out as they passed the Hurkur rocks.
They’ll no be sae close thegither when they come hame.
One old fisherman was heard to prophesies, as the fleet headed for the fishing grounds some 8 or 9 miles away.
They started shooting the lines, two for each crew member, each line with a complement of 1000 hooks which had been painstakingly baited with shelled limpets and mussels by their womenfolk the pervious day. An arduous, finger numbing exercise.
Then around 11am an eerie stillness fell. Kutch dipped sails hung limply from the masts. Not a breath of air stirred. On land, hurricane “Euroclydon” struck. Skies grew leaden, darkening till it was black as night, and the feeble glow of oil lamps were needed in homes. The wind shrieked and howled as it increased in intensity, laying flat 30,000 trees.
An Eyemouth draper saw his horse and van blown into a pond, and watched unbelievingly as uprooted mature trees were propelled along, upright, by the sheer force of the storm. At sea, waves were whipped up to a mountainous seething cauldron, bitter driving rain and stinging spray cut visibility to 500 yards. Masts snapped like matchsticks as the men cut lines and headed desperately for home.
In the hours that followed, 19 boats, each worth around £350, were lost, foundered at sea, or smashed on rocks while trying to gain safe harbour, some within sight and hailing distance of would-be rescuers, who could do nothing but helplessly watch them drown.
Two boats had a miraculous escape, when waves that could have smashed them to matchwood on rocks, lifted them over the danger and deposited them safely on land. Men were swept from decks, but two of them managed to grasp a rope, a gunwale, to be washed back aboard to eventual safety.
189 East coast fishermen lost their lives. 129 from Eyemouth alone, leaving 73 widows and 263 fatherless children. Of those 129 men lost, only 30 bodies were recovered for burial, plus some unidentifiable body parts which were interred in a mass grave on Fort point.
Donations poured into a Disaster fund from all over the land, till the incredible sum of £54,000 was raised. A pension of 5/-(25p) per week was paid to each widow from this, for life or until remarriage, with a further 2/6 for each child until they reached age 14, which kept the faimlies together without recourse to the “poorhouse”.
In 1981 the book “An Old Time Fishing Town, Eyemouth” publishes by Rev. D. McIver in 1906 was reprinted to mark the centenary of the disaster, the proceeds to commission a magnificent granite memorial in the form of a broken mast which now stands in the old cemetery overlooking the bay where so many lives were lost.""" ;

Then Guerrero climbed in herself, huddling protectively over her child.
It was the safest place the terrified mother could find. But it was not safe enough to save two lives.
Guerrero died when the three-family home she lived in collapsed around her, reduced in a devastating instant to a pile of rubble. Her daughter survived, as did her husband, also in the house. The 39-year-old mother was one of three people killed when tornadoes struck Central and Western Massachu setts Wednesday,
Sergey Livchin, 23, also of West Springfield, was killed when a tree crushed his 2005 Kia, and a woman died after being pinned under her trailer in Brimfield, investigators said.
As hundreds of residents picked through the remains of ruined homes yesterday, three families grieved graver losses. Tales of heroism surfaced — neighbors taking in neighbors; strangers helping strangers — but none was more compelling than that of the mother who shielded her daughter from harm.
West Springfield Police Chief Thomas Burke, a four-decade veteran of the department, paused to compose himself at a press conference as he described Guerrero’s sacrifice.
She made sure her child was safe and then “the house came down around her,’’ the chief said. “And she is the one who perished.’’
Guerrero’s daughter, who suffered severe cuts to both legs, was trapped in the rubble-covered bathtub for more than an hour, crying out in pain as rescuers cut through piles of twisted metal. The family lived on the first floor of the Union Street three-decker, which was flattened. Deputy Fire Chief Steven Manchino described a harrowing scene, as sparks from saws threatened to ignite leaking gas.
The house next door was also destroyed, said the fire chief, and an elderly woman was rescued from rubble. Guerrero’s daughter and husband, who were not identified by police, were taken to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield for treatment.
Guerrero, whose body has not yet been identified by her family, died of asphyxiation, officials said.
Others in the neighborhood narrowly escaped. At a house around the corner, a man pushed away a treadmill blocking the basement door just in time to usher his children to safety.
Livchin found no escape route. He was in his family’s car, near Hill and Main streets in West Springfield, when the storm hit, bringing down a massive tree. It was unclear yesterday if he was driving or parked.
“It crushed the roof right down to the seat,’’ said Manchino, who estimated the tree’s diameter at 3 feet.
The oldest of nine children, Livchin lived with his parents and siblings in a well-kept home on the north side of West Springfield. His sister Irina Livchin, 20, said their parents, Vladimir and Yelena Livchin, emigrated from Kyrgyzstan 16 years ago to seek a better life for their children.
Irina Livchin said her older brother, who had dropped out of West Springfield High School, was a jokester who liked to sleep late. She nagged him to get up early Wednesday, to go pick up a used treadmill she was buying, and he did. They spoke again at lunchtime: She joked that he shouldn’t waste some money she had loaned him, and he replied, laughing, “I’ll make sure I will.’’
A few hours later, her brother was gone.
“It was so unexpected, so unreal,’’ she said.
She said her father is trying to be strong, but her mother is suffering, in part because Sergey was the only one of her children who did not go to church, and she fears he may not have gone to heaven. “It’s killing her,’’ Irina Livchin said. “It’s heartbreaking.’’
About 25 miles away in Brimfield, Lester Twarowski, the owner of the Village Green Family Campground, said it took just 30 seconds for an enormous, debris-filled cloud to destroy all 97 trailers at the campground. The tornado lifted one trailer 30 feet into the air before tossing it back down, killing a woman inside and badly injuring a man who lived there, said Twarowski.
Officials in Brimfield did not release the victim’s name, but other campground residents said she was known as Ginger.
Camper Tracy Torteson said Ginger and her husband Rick were back for their second season at the campsite. She said Ginger enjoyed reading, photography, and especially walking her small dog, Daisy.

"This cloud appeared and there was stuff flying in it," Twarowski said. "There was debris by the building. If the building wasn't there, we would have been dead."
He said the cloud, which was about a half-mile wide, wreaked havoc on the camp ground for about 30 seconds.
"We got them all inside, and we all cried," Twarowski said. "We all hugged."
Moments later, he was hustling into the basement of his home. Joining him were his mother, his daughter, and several people who had come in from off the street, including a young man and his infant child.
Today, he described seeing an enormous debris-filled cloud moving toward the facility when he looked out the window shortly before 5 p.m.
BRIMFIELD - Lester Twarowski is the owner of the Village Green Family Campground here where a woman was killed during Wednesday's storm.
He said the powerful wind lifted the couple's trailer about 30 feet into the air and then crashed back down to the ground.
He said he did not know the woman's name, but knew that she was 50 years old and enjoyed walking her small dog around the campground.
Twarowski said her husband was rescued and was "clinging to life" in a hospital Thursday.
He said all 97 trailers on the campground have been destroyed, and he has suffered at least $1 million dollars in damages. He said he does have insurance, but he does not know if it will cover all of the rebuilding costs.
Paul Levesque Jr., 46, said he was standing outside of his trailer at about 4:30 p.m. when small-sized hail began falling.
Seconds later, he said, the entire area "went black" and he ran inside his trailer, which began to shake and was lifted about 12 inches off the ground.
"Everything in my camper got thrown around and tossed around," he said.
He said that when the storm passed, he exited his trailer and began helping other people. One woman was stuck under a tree, and he worked with other campers to pull her out. She suffered a broken arm but was otherwise unscathed, he said.
Levesque, a mason, said he had just sent out more than $50,000 worth of contract proposals to sites in New York. But now, he said, with his truck and tools severely damaged, he is unsure if he will be able to work those jobs if they are awarded to him.
However, Levesque said, he is thankful that he survived.
"I thought I was dead, I didn't think I was getting out of there,'' he said. "God bless my grandmother, I think she was watching.\"""" ;

Jeffrey McCollough of the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission snapped a few photos on Thursday, June 9. He says trees were down across the stretch of trail between Memorial Bridge and LA Fitness, including Riverfront Park. Other sections of the River Walk were impassable because of electric wires down on the corridor.

Widespread rain developed ahead of the storm late on Monday February 12. The moisture moved into colder air as it crossed into northern Kentucky, southern Indiana and Ohio early on Tuesday. This caused the rain to change to snow, and dropped anywhere from 1 to 5 inches of snow on much of the region by daybreak Tuesday. As the storm intensified, it drew in warmer air from the south, which caused the snow to quickly change to sleet and freezing rain Tuesday morning and afternoon across much of the I-70 corridor and points south. Areas from Dayton to Columbus received several inches of sleet on top of the snow, which later turned into freezing rain with up to a quarter inch of ice on trees and power lines. Further south, snow had quickly changed to freezing rain Tuesday morning. This included areas from the northern Cincinnati suburbs into Wilmington and areas south of Columbus. The temperature never warmed above freezing across these areas, which allowed ice to accumulate to between a half inch and an inch. This resulted in significant tree damage and numerous power outages. Southern portions of Cincinnati and far northern Kentucky saw temperatures warm to near or slightly above freezing which alleviated some of the icing, but still allowed up to a quarter of an inch of ice accumulation and several downed tree limbs and power lines.
Further north, the intensifying storm caused the pressure gradient to tighten across western and northern Ohio and resulted in very strong winds with gusts up to 45 mph. This caused significant blowing and drifting of snow across areas from Troy to Marysville, and further north into Celina, Wapakoneta and Bellefontaine. As a result, road crews had a very difficult time keeping roads clear, and by Tuesday afternoon, travel across west central Ohio was nearly impossible. By Tuesday evening, a level 3 snow emergency had been declared in many counties in west central Ohio. The snow continued late Tuesday night, and by Wednesday morning had accumulated to anywhere from 8 to 15 inches. The wind caused snow to drift substantially, and in some cases drifts were over 4 feet high.

(JTA) -- Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski asked for forgiveness at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the Jedwabne massacre.
Sunday's ceremony marked the 1941 pogrom in the Polish town where at least 340 Jews were murdered. Most were burned to death in a barn.
"Today, Poland can still hear the never-fading cry of its citizens," Komorowski said. "Once again, I beg forgiveness."
Also Sunday, Chief Rabbi of Poland Michael Schudrich recited the Mourners' Kaddish at a monument to the massacre victims.
"Holocaust survivors view Jedwabne as a symbol of the widespread, but little acknowledged, collaboration by the local population in the countries occupied by the Nazis in the slaughter and the plunder of the Jews during World War II," Elan Steinberg, vice president of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants, said in a statement. "The wholesale participation by their fellow citizens -- their neighbors -- in the persecution of the Jews is very much neglected and still largely suppressed in most of the European nations who were conquered by or allied with the Nazi regime. The Holocaust was not solely a German affair.
"The ceremonies today at Jedwabne is a welcome and important step in the confrontation with the truth by the Polish nation," he said.
Jedwabne Mayor Krzysztof Moenke did not attend the memorial ceremony, which Steinberg called a "disgraceful failure." Steinberg said that Moenke's actions show "that much remains to be learned and taught."

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WGGB)-- Community activists held a rally on Monday at Springfield's Court Square to call attention to the plight of homeless tornado victims.
One of those homes was Irene Malave and her family, "Out of the blue, my windows started shattering, my kids were all in their rooms, I had to get my son out of the playpen," says Malave.
Malave and her family are living in a temporary shelter at the Mass Mutual Center.
"There is no going back home," says Malave. "The building is no longer there, it's been torn down, two days after the tornado hit," says Malave.
Community organizers rallied to send a message says Lara Shepard-Blue, "We're trying to figure out creative solutions to insure that people staying at the shelter who are not people of means, that they found other places to live. We need to keep the community together and we need to find affordable housing solutions," says Lara Shepard-Blue.
Organizers at the rally say the difficult housing market for the poor has been made even more difficult because of the tornadoes that swept through Western Massachusetts on June 1st.
Former Massachusetts Gubernatorial Candidate Grace Ross was among those calling for a community commitment to open the doors for tornado victims. "All of our neighbors count, nobody is made homeless and left homeless because we can't find the political will to make sure rents are affordable to make sure there are enough units available," says Ross.
Meanwhile, it looks like Irene Malave and her family are finally getting some good news. "Right now I've found a three bedroom apartment, I had all the papers done. I'm just waiting for the inspection to be done and I can move in," says Malave.
More than 500 people were displaced by the tornadoes. There are still some 160 left at the Mass Mutual Center.

That's why the ministries founder, Dr. Annie B. Watson, invited women who are living in the shelter like Maria Deleon to attend. Deleon says she's glad she has a place to lay her head at night, but it's tough. "You have to wait for everything, hours, and people are telling you what to do."
Springfield Health and Human Services Director Helen Caulton-Harris says they've placed 48 families so far. They'll keep the shelter open as long as they have to, but don't expect it to run through the summer. "The Housing Department is working with various agencies to place individuals, and now that we have the FEMA declaration we have people from FEMA who will be working in our Housing Department as well."
And, it may be a long wait. As of Thursday morning there were almost 250 people living at the MassMutual Center; that's a lot of housing to track down.
Michael Runnell says he's waiting for a place he can fit his whole family. Until then, he's celebrating at the conference next door, thankful his family is alive. "God helped us and God saved our life that day, so we have to come worship God. We have to tell God thanks because he gave us life one more time. It was something, we were in this apartment when this tornado hit and we have to be grateful, we have to be grateful."
Out of almost 250 people staying at the shelter, about 40 of those are children.
One of the challenges they face is finding the right kind of housing for people. Many say they don't want their family torn apart by the tornado.""" ;

When inspectors first fanned out across the tornado-stricken area, they picked through some 1,400 substantially damaged homes and estimated damage at about $25 million, enough to qualify for federal relief.
“But we know there’s much more than that,’’ said Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency spokesman Peter Judge.
Authorities may never be able to tally the exact total because some residents may not ask for FEMA funds, relying on insurance claims, he added.
“People ask me, ‘How big is the disaster?’ ’’ Judge said. “I’ll tell you when everybody stops registering.’’
Starting today, officials expect hundreds of tornado victims in Springfield and West Springfield, two of the hardest-hit communities, to flood two federal disaster recovery centers in search of assistance from FEMA and Small Business Administration representatives. Seven more centers are slated to open over the next few days in Westfield, Agawam, Wilbraham, Brimfield, Southbridge, Monson, and Sturbridge.
Local residents can also go to the centers for help from various state agencies, including the Department of Transitional Assistance and the Division of Unemployment, Judge said.
A trip to the centers is not necessary to receive aid, which can take several forms, including funding for temporary housing or repairs, cash for emergency clothing and food, or loans for rebuilding homes. Claimants can register for relief online at www.disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362.
There is no cap on the number of communities, businesses, or individuals that can collect federal relief, Judge said. But there are restrictions: For example, people will only receive enough to pay for what their insurance does not cover.""" ;

<https://web.archive.org/web/20130927152622/http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-poison-gas-20130822,0,2731889.story> dct:description """BEIRUT — In what the opposition called the worst atrocity of Syria's civil war, antigovernment activists accused the government of killing hundreds of civilians, including many women and children, in a poison-gas attack targeting pro-rebel Damascus suburbs.
The Syrian government called reports of a massacre untrue, but the scale of the alleged carnage and the graphic videos of the dead and injured that surfaced Wednesday left many officials across the globe demanding action.
If verified, such a massive gas attack could alter the international response to the war that has raged since March 2011. Last year, President Obama called the potential use of chemical weapons in Syria a "red line" that could prompt U.S. intervention.
The U.S. has provided humanitarian and nonlethal aid to the rebels but has been reluctant to get more deeply involved. Despite a declaration in June that it would start providing military assistance, rebels say they have yet to receive any such aid, nor have they been told what to expect or when they will get it.
The opposition said rockets tipped with some kind of apparent nerve agent rained down overnight on areas to the east and south of the Syrian capital, all strongholds of rebels fighting to overthrow the government of President Bashar Assad.
Video uploaded onto YouTube showed rows of bodies, some arrayed on the floors of makeshift clinics. Many were children in underwear and pajamas, purported victims of a barrage that allegedly occurred about 3 a.m. Other footage showed people choking, flailing their arms uncontrollably, rolling their eyes, foaming at the mouth and exhibiting other signs of what could be the effects of chemical poisoning. Most showed no indication of wounds or bleeding.
In one clip, a distraught man cradled what was described as the corpse of his daughter, asking why it had happened.
Each side in the conflict has accused the other of using chemical weapons, and both sides deny the charges. The U.S. and its allies have said that evidence indicates the Syrian military has used small amounts of sarin, a nerve agent, on several occasions.
Experts who had been skeptical of previous claims said the new images showed more convincing signs of a chemical attack. But they raised a number of questions that could not immediately be answered. Some suggested the pictures suggested use of a low-grade agent.
The United States and other nations urged that a United Nations team that arrived in Damascus over the weekend to investigate previous charges of chemical weapons use be ordered to look into this incident as well.
The U.N. Security Council convened a two-hour emergency session. But afterward, the U.N., which long has been deeply divided on Syria, issued a statement condemning any use of chemical weapons as a "violation of international law," calling for a "thorough and prompt investigation" and renewing calls for a cease-fire in Syria.
The major U.S.-backed Syrian opposition group said more than 1,300 people were killed, while other antigovernment groups put the number in the hundreds. Such numbers would seem to represent the largest single-day death toll in a conflict that the U.N. says has already cost more than 100,000 lives.
One activist who lives near the town of Arbeen said rockets began hitting the area about 2:30 a.m. Residents who had been sleeping in their basements to protect themselves from shelling could not escape the chemicals, he said.
Another, reached by Skype in Zamalka, said he was awake when the first rocket hit his area. He and his friends, who are part of a volunteer ambulance team, rushed to the scene. Families stumbled out of their homes and into the street, still dressed in their pajamas, choking and out of breath, he said.
By early morning, drugs at three makeshift hospitals had run out, and victims were being treated with water, he said, adding that medical personnel were attempting to wash out people's eyes and mouths with soda.
"These reports are uncorroborated and we are urgently seeking more information," British Foreign Minister William Hague said in a statement in London. "But it is clear that if they are verified, it would mark a shocking escalation in the use of chemical weapons in Syria."
The official Syrian news agency called the reports untrue and designed to derail the ongoing U.N. inquiry.
A Syrian military official appeared on state television denouncing the reports as a desperate opposition attempt to make up for rebel defeats on the ground. After months in which rebels were making steady gains against the government, pro-Assad forces have held the momentum for much of this year, regaining territory around Damascus and in several other parts of the country.
Russia, a close ally of Assad, labeled the accusation a "premeditated provocation." Moscow has backed the Syrian government's contention that it is antigovernment rebels, not the military, who have previously used toxic gas. A Russian investigation indicated that rebels had produced chemical arms using a "cottage industry" approach, Moscow said.
Any expanded U.N. inquiry would require approval of the Syrian government. Some kind of safe passage would have to be arranged for U.N. inspectors to enter what are heavily contested war zones. The U.S. and other governments called on Damascus to agree to a new inquiry.""" ;

A handful of flights were diverted to Ontario International Airport after all traffic was grounded at LAX in the aftermath of a shooting that stunned passengers and snarled travel across the nation.
Other operations at Ontario Airport were running as normal and flight schedules were not affected, said LA/Ontario Airport spokeswoman Maria Tesoro-Fermin.
Flights are expected to resume as normal Saturday at Ontario, however flight schedules at LAX remain unclear. Heightened security at Ontario and other airports could continue as the TSA investigates the shooting.
Passengers were cautioned Friday to arrive early and expect long security lines. ONT also added heightened visible security at the airport, according to airport officials. That could be a setting travelers could face in the weeks and months to come.
“The passengers can expect to see the presence of officers and K-9 units on patrol,” said Harold Johnson, a spokesman for the airport in Ontario.
The shooting at LAX left one Transportation Security Administration officer dead and left at least three other people injured, authorities said.
The slain employee was the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty in the 12-year history of the agency, which was founded in the aftermath of 9/11.
The gunman was wounded in a shootout with police and taken into custody, authorities said. Two law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly, identified the gunman as Paul Ciancia, 23, of Pennsville, N.J. He had apparently been living in Los Angeles.
600 LAND IN ONTARIO
Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX, said at a press conference that planes were landing at LAX Friday at “less than half the normal arrival rate.”
Lindsey said it will take “quite a deal of time” to get operations back to normal at the airport. She said it will be a “carefully orchestrated logistical ballet.”
As of 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 1, five flights had landed at Ontario -- three American Airlines flights and two Southwest flights, officials said.
About 600 passengers on those were taken by shuttle and bus from Ontario back to LAX.
One Virgin American flight was diverted from LAX to the Palm Springs International Airport.
Ontario is generally designated for flight diversions in the LA area.
“If there’s bad weather at LAX, Ontario is the diversion airport,” Tesoro-Fermin said.
The incident left diverted passengers scrambling for a way to get back to Los Angeles from Ontario.
Roger Roberts, a 32-year-old passenger who flew in from Toronto, Canada, for a film audition in LA, chose to arrange for his own transportation and paid for a shuttle bus to get to the hotel room he reserved in Beverly Hills.
“I don't feel like waiting around,” he said as he boarded a big blue van.
Law enforcement officers milled through Terminal Four in Ontario, where many diverted passengers were sitting and waiting for further direction Friday afternoon.
Despite the extra passengers and security, ONT seemed calm and quiet compared with the chaotic LAX.
Some passengers, such as Jane Nadler, had family in the area who could pick them up.
Nadler's son was on his way to pick her up shortly after her plane from New York's JFK International Airport landed, but her arrival had one major hitch -- her luggage was still on the plane headed to LAX.
“Luckily I really only need what I'm wearing. LA's so casual,” she said.
The fate of luggage on the diverted flights was unclear. LAX officials said abandoned materials in their terminals could be collected at LAX baggage claim.
Helen Nestor, a native of a town near London who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said she was horrified at the crime that affected the lives of so many.
“There's too many shootings going on,” she said. “I'm sick of it.”
Additional flights were diverted, but airport officials were unsure Friday evening how many arrivals ended up in Ontario.
Security was also heightened at other Southern California airports, but some airports, including Long Beach, Orange County John Wayne and Burbank, were operating on normal procedures. Travelers were urged to arrive early and check on the status of flights in advance.
Officials urged travelers flying out of LAX to check with their airlines on the status of flights and to check the LAX Twitter feed @LAX_Official for updates.
THOUSANDS DELAYED
Thousands of fliers across the U.S. were delayed by the attack and subsequent investigation. The prolonged shutdown at the nation’s third largest airport was particularly troublesome for those hoping to head to the East Coast or across the Pacific Ocean.
Flights bound for Los Angeles that had not yet taken off were held at their gates for hours by the Federal Aviation Administration. The so-called ground stop was in effect until around 4 p.m. PDT. Nearly 200 flights were canceled. Some flights already in the air were allowed to land at LAX, while others diverted to nearby airports.
Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports, which operates the Los Angeles airport, said Friday afternoon that 746 flights nationwide were affected by the incident. Some 46 were diverted, and others were held at LAX or at the originating airport.
Flight tracking site FlightAware.com said that as of 3:30 p.m. PDT, 195 flights to and from LAX were canceled and another 268 were delayed. To put that in perspective, there were roughly 200 other flight cancellations nationwide Friday, mostly in New York and Philadelphia because of rain and wind.
Some passengers who landed at LAX after the shooting spent at least two hours sitting on planes parked in a remote corner of the airport.
Even though the airport never fully closed, travelers trying to fly out were unable to reach it because of massive road closures.
Lindsey said it will take “quite a deal of time” to get operations back to normal. She said it will be a “carefully orchestrated logistical ballet.”
LAX’s Terminal 3, where the shooting occurred, remained closed Friday evening as the forensics investigation continued.
A man carrying a note that said he wanted to “kill TSA” pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a bag around 9:20 a.m. local time and shot his way past a security checkpoint. One Transportation Security Administration officer was killed and at least three other were wounded, authorities said.
One security expert doubted much could be done to prevent similar incidents.
“I am not sure what can be done other than effectively banning most types of guns as in the U.K. where there are minimal shootings,” said Kenneth J. Button, a public policy professor and director of the Center for Transportation, Policy, Operations and Logistics at George Mason University.
“This could just as well happened on a street in New York or at a shopping mall,” Button said in an email in which he also alluded to last year’s mass shootings in a Colorado movie theater and at a Connecticut elementary school. He added that “airports are possibly one of the safest places given the security there.”
Los Angles is a major gateway for flights to Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Domestically, the largest cities served are San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, San Jose, Calif., San Diego and Phoenix.
However, it is not a major connection point such as Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas and Minneapolis.
Most airlines issued waivers for people traveling through Los Angeles, allowing them to change flights without paying a fee.
JetBlue diverted flights from Boston, New York and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to nearby Long Beach airport. Southwest Airlines diverted at least one flight — a trip from Chicago that landed in Denver.
Officials at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix said seven flights to Los Angeles were canceled, including five on Southwest. Seven flights from Sky Harbor to LAX were delayed and 10 flights headed to Los Angeles from elsewhere were diverted to Sky Harbor.

Gerardo Hernandez, 39, was shot at point-blank range and crumpled to the floor, authorities said. The gunman rode up an escalator, turned around and noticed the bleeding man squirming.
He went back and fired again, authorities said, killing Hernandez.
Authorities filed a murder charge Saturday against the man they allege opened fire, Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, and offered chilling new details that suggested the rampage was explicitly aimed at Transportation Security Administration agents.
The gunman was carrying a signed, handwritten note in his duffel bag that said he wanted to "instill fear into their traitorous minds," said David Bowdich, special agent in charge of the Counterterrorism Division at the FBI's Los Angeles office.
"His intent was very clear in his note," Bowdich told reporters Saturday. "In that note he indicated his anger and his malice toward the TSA officers."
A law enforcement official told The Times that the screed resembled a "suicide note." The gunman said he didn't want to hurt anyone "innocent" — only TSA agents. The note also mentioned "NWO," a possible reference to the New World Order, a conspiracy theory that holds that forces are trying to create a totalitarian one-world government.
The shooter was apparently dropped off at LAX just after 9 a.m. Friday, authorities said, though they gave no details about the driver. The triggerman wore dark clothes and a bulletproof vest and had not purchased a ticket. He carried a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber M&P-15 assault rifle, five loaded magazines and a trove of ammunition, Bowdich said.
After shooting Hernandez, authorities and witnesses said, the gunman calmly fired his way through the screening area, all the while cursing TSA agents. He asked terrified bystanders: "Are you TSA?" If they answered no, he moved on.
In a 10-minute rampage that was captured on video, the shooter wounded two more TSA agents and injured at least one bystander, authorities said. Some travelers ducked behind planters and advertising kiosks to avoid gunfire; others fled to taxiing planes. Airport police, who were "60 seconds behind the suspect," according to airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon, shot the gunman in the leg and head near a food court.
The accused shooter remains "unresponsive" at a local hospital, said authorities, who have been unable to interview him. In addition to murder, federal prosecutors charged him with committing violence at an international airport. If convicted, the suspect could face life in prison or the death penalty.
The rampage temporarily halted traffic at the nation's third-busiest airport, stranding thousands of passengers. Terminal 3, which houses Virgin America, JetBlue and other airlines, reopened Saturday afternoon.
Hernandez was the first TSA agent slain in the line of duty.
On Saturday, Hernandez's widow briefly addressed reporters, praising her husband as an ever-smiling father of two who came to L.A. from El Salvador at age 15 and joined the TSA three years ago. A neighbor said he routinely woke up at 3 a.m. to get to LAX on time.
"He was always excited to go to work," said Ana Hernandez, who struggled to remain composed. "I am truly devastated."
John S. Pistole, who oversees the TSA, joined Hernandez in front of the family's Porter Ranch home. He said the unarmed TSA agents — often derided in politics and pop culture as an airport nuisance — were, in many respects, "the first line of defense" against violence.
He said the agency plans to reassess its policies, though he acknowledged that "we can't guard against all threats and all risks." J. David Cox, president of the union that represents 45,000 TSA employees, said airports should station armed security guards at each checkpoint, and that it should be a federal crime to assault a TSA officer.
Investigators said they were combing Ciancia's background for a possible motive. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic grew up in the Philadelphia suburb of Pennsville Township, N.J., where his father runs an auto body shop.""" ;

Gerardo I. Hernandez, a 39-year-old father of two, was shot multiple times, according to a one-page statement released Wednesday by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. A final autopsy report is expected to be released Friday.
Hernandez became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty when a gunman opened fire at the airport the morning of Nov. 1. Three others were wounded before the suspect — identified as Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23 — was shot in a gun battle with airport police and taken into custody.
Ciancia was released Monday from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center into the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.
A report from the Associated Press last week quoted Marshall McClain, president of the airport police officers union, alleging that a veteran Los Angeles Police Department officer delayed medical attention for Hernandez despite reaching the agent minutes after he had been shot.
The AP report cited officials who saw surveillance video. The officer "checked on" Hernandez several times and told others he was already dead. The report said more than 30 minutes passed before airport police brought Hernandez to paramedics.
Hernandez was in full cardiac arrest by the time he was brought out of the terminal, an emergency medical source with knowledge of the incident told The Times. Paramedics took him to a hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him.
"My point is we are trained to render aid," McClain told The Times. "It is not your job to decide someone is dead."
Los Angeles police officials said they would investigate the officer's alleged conduct. But LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called the report's claims "highly speculative," saying it was too early to draw conclusions about how officers responded.
On Saturday, a statement issued by Los Angeles World Airports, the FBI, the Los Angeles Fire Department, the LAPD and the TSA called some of the statements made about the shooting and the response "untrue," while others "merit serious consideration by our respective agencies."

KILLEEN, Texas -- Four people are confirmed dead and 16 people are injured following a shooting at Fort Hood, according to Fort Hood III Corps Commanding Lt. Gen. Mark Milley.
The 16 patients are being treated at Scott & White Hospital in Temple and Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood. Scott & White said it has three patients still in serious condition. Six patients have been discharged.
On Thursday afternoon, Milley said the alleged shooter was 34-year-old Spc. Ivan A. Lopez, a Puerto Rico native.
According to Fort Hood officials, around 4 p.m. Lopez allegedly opened fire in an administrative building. He then went to the 1st Medical Brigade area of Fort Hood and fired more shots. He was using a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol.
Two wounded soldiers made the first 911 call around 4:16 p.m. A female military police officer confronted Lopez in a parking lot, exchanging fire. Lopez died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Milley said pending an autopsy report, it's unknown if Lopez had any other injuries.
Fort Hood officials say Lopez didn't seem to target any specific people during the shooting, but they are looking into reports that he got into an argument with someone right before the shooting.
Milley said Lopez was an active duty soldier that had recently been stationed at Fort Hood. He had previously been an infantryman at Fort Bliss. Lopez was married and has family in the Fort Hood area.
Milley also said Lopez was undergoing treatment for anxiety, depression and several other psychological disorders. He was also being evaluated for a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, but had not yet been diagnosed.
Milley said the Lopez served four months in Iraq in 2011 with the 13th Sustainment Command. According to military records, he was never wounded in action.
Milley said Lopez bought the pistol on March 1 from Guns Galore in Killeen, the same store that sold weapons to Maj. Nidal Hasan. A military jury sentenced Hasan to death for killing 13 people and injuring more than 30 in a 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood. Guns Galore is also the same store where AWOL soldier Naser Abdo bought bomb-making materials for an attack he was planning.
Around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, FBI and ATF agents met with the Guns Galore store manager and collected evidence. Store employees would not talk on camera but say they exercise their right to use discretion when selling guns, and all sales are cleared through an FBI check.
On the day Lopez bought the weapon, he posted on Facebook: "I have just lost my inner peace, full of hatred, I think this time the devil will take me. I was robbed last night and I am sure it was 2 [guys]. Green light and finger ready. As easy as that."
Lopez lived with his family in the Terrace Heights Appartment Complex about five miles from Fort Hood.
Neighbor and military wife Shaneice Banks says she saw Lopez the day of the shooting around lunch time and couldn't tell anything was wrong.
"I was just asking how his day was going, you know, being a good neighbor, you know, and he was like, you know, 'My day's going good. I'll see you whenever I come home.' And I was like 'OK, have a good rest of the day,'" Banks said.
Just a few hours later, Banks and another neighbor were comforting Lopez's wife.
"She might have thought he was a victim. I mean that is from what I gathered because she said she hasn't talked to him since 3:00," said neighbor Xanderia Morris. "She was about to go up stairs when they alerted, they said his name over the news. Once they said his name, she immediately just stopped and, like she was about to collapse."
Officials are investigating any possible terrorist motives, but say there's currently no indication that this was an act of terrorism. They are also investigating if the shooting was premeditated.
Milley cited several acts of "clear heroism" in a Thursday press conference, mentioning a chaplain who shielded soldiers from gunfire and broke several windows to get them to safety. The chaplain survived.
On Wednesday afternoon, Fort Hood's official account tweeted "All personnel on post are asked to shelter in place." Waco police said emergency sirens were sounding on post, and personnel were being advised to stay away from windows and keep doors closed and locked. The "all clear" was given just before 9 p.m. Wednesday.
The Instagram video below from nearby Fort Hood. The sirens announcing "Shelter in place" can be heard in the video.
KVUE's sister station KENS 5 says about 20 rounds were shot outside near the transportation motor pool, but then the shooter went in to the medical brigade building, according to a soldier on post at Fort Hood. The soldier said there appeared to be some sort of standoff happening.
"Immediately heard four gun shots and assumed they were blank rounds," a soldier said. "We then heard a burst, another burst, and it was clear they weren't blank rounds. They were live rounds."
The soldier also said soldiers took off from the transportation motor pool toward a 7-foot-high barbed wire fence and tried to climb the fence to get away. The soldier said he saw at least one person get hit.
"Most of the soldiers got away. We saw one soldier jump over the fence, and it looked like he was shot. He hit the ground really hard. Three soldiers had to come help to pick him up," the soldier said.
Central Texas College in Killeen evacuated its campus and evening classes were canceled. Killeen ISD was also on lockdown until Wednesday night.
The Red Cross Joint Assistance Center is established at the Killeen Community Center, 2201 E. Veterans Memorial Blvd., Killeen, Texas. Monetary donations made be submitted online at www.redcross.org.
Fort Hood was the scene of a mass shooting in 2009. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded in what was the deadliest attack on a domestic military installation in history. Maj. Nidal Hasan was sentenced to death for the shooting rampage.
According to CNN, after the November 2009 mass shootings security upgrades were made at Fort Hood. Armed guards were posted at key locations, random container inspections were conducted, vehicles entering must display a Department of Defense Sticker, some buildings require badge access and soldiers assigned must register their personal firearms with emergency services.""" ;

For years it was one of Texas' most infamous unsolved murders. Five people kidnapped from Kilgore's Kentucky Fried Chicken -- and then shot execution style -- in the middle of nowhere.
For so many East Texans, Kilgore's KFC Murders will never be anything more than the pictures that have lasted three decades. A fast food place, fingreprints and an overgrown oil field five people should never have seen.
Rusk County District Attorney's investigator William Brown was there from day one.
"But my number one question is still 'why here?," says Rusk County DA Investigator William Brown.
At the time, cooperation between law enforcement agencies was lacking and no one on the scene had any idea five people had gone missing from near-by Kilgore.
"And we still didn't know where they had come from until we got up here and found Opie and she had on a KFC uniform," says Brown.
39-year-old Opie Hughes had been sexually assaulted and then shot. Further down the road, 37-year-old Mary Tyler, 20-year-old Joey Johnson, 19-year-old Monte Landers and 20-year-old David Maxwell had been lined up and shot.
"They're all face down/facing that way.Which is to say the least, unusual./very," says Brown
Unusual because they didn't expect to die.
"If we were to all lie down, expecting to get back up in a minute, we would put our face or our head on something./To keep it from being in the dirt./Yeah because we didn't want our nose stuck in the dirt."
For twelve years, evidence found at both crime scenes led nowhere. Investigators say it was a cold case that every armchair detective and every criminal looking for a break would have claimed to have already solved. There was a false alarm in 1995, when Jimmy Mankins, Jr. was arrested and charged with the murders.
It was a shaky case, based largely on a ripped fingernail found in the waistband of one of the victims and allegedly Mankins' repeated boasting that he had done it. Investigators believe he was trying to gain credibility among drug dealers. Eventually he was cleared and then spoke exclusively with CBS19.
"100% I'm innocent and I resent even the question," says Mankins.
He said investigators had no reason to lock him up in the first place.
"The worst part was the six months in jail over there thinking about being put to death for something I didn't do. And more than likely if it wasn't for that DNA I would have been on death row."
Now he's back in prison for something else. But he was right, the DNA was the key. A box and a napkin found behind the counter at KFC had been waiting in a lab for years until someone figured out how to see whose blood was on them. Romeo Pinkerton and Darnell Hartsfield, already in jail on unrelated charges, were identified as two of the three murderers in 2005. Ironically, they'd been among the original suspects in 1983-- Even placed on a makeshift wanted for questioning poster. But they fell through the cracks.
Hartsfield was convicted in 2008 and told CBS19 the jury was wrong.
"Me and my cousin Romeo Pinkerton, we were just being, we were stooges for the state."
In the mean time, Pinkerton had already admitted guilt to avoid the death penalty which gave Opie Hughes' husband a reason to smile after nearly 25 years.
"I got the privileged of hearing that snake say 'guilty.' And he's not said it once. He's said it five times, " says Jack Hughes.
Amazingly, his wife's rapist, the third suspect has never been identified. But the verdicts and two people in prison for life were enough for David Maxwell's former wife.
"No matter what happens from this point on, I'm free. I was paroled today." "He counted, to me. And so as long as I can stand up, I'm going to make sure people know," says Lana Dunkerly.""" ;

Amy took after their bookish father, Samuel Bishop, who taught film at Northeastern University. Outdoors-loving Seth was more like their mother, Judith Bishop, an avid horsewoman involved in local politics.
Encouraged by their parents, the Bishop kids excelled. Amy was an especially good student and a devoted violinist. So quiet she was almost invisible at Braintree High, she was close to her younger brother, despite their three-year age difference. She even credited him with saving her life when she fell down a cliff on one of their hikes; Seth was able to leverage his knowledge of physics into figuring out how to pull her back up the rocks despite his slim adolescent frame.
They both chose their father's university when it was time for college. Amy majored in biology, then Seth started in the engineering program.
On December 6, 1986, Amy Bishop, then 21, and her father had an argument, the nature of which has not been publicly disclosed. He left to do some Christmas shopping. Judith was out horseback riding. Seth, 18, stayed home to wash the car.
Amy went upstairs and loaded the pump-action shotgun that her father had bought after their house had been burglarized. She would later tell police that she wanted to make sure she knew how it worked, in case anyone ever broke in again. If the family argument had something to do with her decision to grab the gun, she's never let on.
Accidentally or intentionally, Amy Bishop fired the gun in her parents' room. She tried to cover up the holes in the wall with a metal Band-Aid box and a book jacket.
Soon Judith Bishop was home for lunch. Seth had finished washing the car, run out for some groceries, and returned. He'd just turned on the TV in the living room and was coming back into the kitchen when Amy came downstairs.
Amy told her mother that there was a shell in the gun and she didn't know how to unload it. Judy Bishop says she warned Amy not to point the gun at anyone. Amy would later say that Seth, who along with his father was a member of a local gun club, advised her to point it at the ceiling.
Yet somehow Amy Bishop shot her brother Seth in the chest. He died almost instantly.
Amy ran out of the house. She later told police she thought she'd dropped the gun as she fled. But she had the 12-gauge shotgun with her when she reached the Dave Dinger Ford dealership, according to witnesses who would report she aimed it at Tom Pettigrew and Jeff Doyle. The two men say she demanded a car and told them that she and her husband had just had a fight and that she was afraid he was going to kill her.
Police soon caught up to her, crouched behind a parked car. She refused to drop her gun when they ordered her to; an officer had to grab her from behind. There was still a shell in the gun, and another in her pocket. Police took her in for questioning, but her mother soon arrived, ordered her not to talk, and spirited her away.
Seth Bishop's death was quickly ruled accidental. But now authorities aren't so sure that the case was handled properly.""" ;

As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014
H.R. 4802 would direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to undertake a variety of activities aimed at enhancing security at airports where TSA performs or oversees security-related activities. The bill would require TSA to verify that all such airports have plans in place for responding to security threats and to provide technical assistance as necessary to improve such plans. H.R. 4802 also would require TSA to disseminate information on best practices for addressing security threats and ensure that all screening personnel have received training in how to handle potential shooting threats. Finally, H.R. 4802 would require the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications to report to the Congress on the capacity of law enforcement, fire, and medical response teams to communicate and respond to security threats at airports.
Based on information from DHS, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4802 would cost about $2.5 million in 2015, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Of that amount, CBO assumes the department would spend about $1.5 million to provide additional technical assistance to airports and about $1 million to evaluate the interoperability of communication systems used by emergency response teams. H.R. 4802 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.
H.R. 4802 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.""" ;

The attacker who shot four Marines to death in Chattanooga, Tennessee, had at least three guns plus a vest to carry extra ammunition, and he apparently died in a firefight with police, authorities said Friday.
The killer, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, had at least two long guns — only identified as rifles or shotguns — and a handgun, said Ed Reinhold, special agent in charge of the bureau's Knoxville office.
He said that some of the guns were bought legally but some may not have been.
Abdulazeez sprayed a military recruitment station with at least two dozen bullets on Thursday, then drove about seven miles to a Navy and Marines reserve center, where he killed the Marines.
The attacker shot a Chattanooga police officer during a firefight at the reserve center. Other officers dragged the wounded officer, Sgt. Dennis Pedigo Jr., to safety while shots were still being exchanged, police said.
Officers engaged Abdulazeez shortly after he arrived at the reserve center, Reinhold said. Abdulazeez was wearing a load-bearing vest so he could carry extra magazines of ammunition.
"He was a moving target, and he was able to, obviously, kill the four Marines and wound the one sailor," Reinhold said. The sailor and the police officer were two of three people wounded in the attack.
RELATED: U.S. Officials Looking Into Gunman's Travel, Devices
All indications are that Abdulazeez was killed by police, Reinhold said. Authorities had not previously said whether Abdulazeez killed himself or was killed by police. An autopsy is pending.
Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher called the police response a "breathtaking example of that everyday courage." He said other officers raced to the scene, including some who were off duty at home and put on their uniforms to come help.
"Chattanooga police officers proved themselves in every sense of the word, heroes," the chief said. "They are my heroes."
Reinhold said the FBI has not formally classified the shooting as terrorism but was investigating it as terrorism until the facts prove otherwise.
Authorities have not uncovered evidence that the shootings were inspired or directed by ISIS or any other terror group. "He doesn't seem to have left much of a social media footprint," one official said.""" ;

Police in Tennessee on Tuesday released video showing the April arrest of Mohammad Abdulazeez on a driving under the influence charge, three months before he allegedly launched a deadly attack on military facilities in Chattanooga.
A Chattanooga police officer pulled over Abdulazeez at around 2:10 a.m. on April 20, and police said he smelled of marijuana and alcohol and appeared impaired.
The video shows Abdulazeez weave in traffic before being stopped. Abdulazeez said he was around others drinking but said he hadn't been drinking. One of the two officers tells the other with surprise, "he has a lot of pills, all over the place."
Related: FBI Raids Apartment of Chattanooga Shooter's Friends
Abdulazeez tried to explain his erratic driving away due to a lack of sleep. He tells officers he has a hunting knife in his car and has difficulty walking heel-to-toe.
"I don't feel that I should be taken in right now. I mean, was my driving that ...?" Abdulazeez asks.
The officer replies, "it was that bad."
At one point the future-gunman tries to ask about another police officer who he said is a friend, and the arresting officer sighs, "Oh Lord, don't start dropping police names at this point."
Abdulazeez fatally shot four Marines and a Navy sailor in the July 16 attack on a military reserve center, before he was shot and killed during a firefight with police, officials said.
Abdulazeez' family has said he had a history of drug abuse and he was deeply depressed before the deadly attack. He was due in court on the DUI charges in in July.""" ;

Attracting upwards of 70,000 ravers and revelers each day, the party started in 1999 as a humble one-day festivity on South Beach. Over 15 years later, it's the world's premiere EDM festival spawning 10 other festivals worldwide throughout the year in destinations as far and wide as Ibiza and Tokyo.
The festival overlaps with Winter Music Conference (WMC) and the week is commonly referred to as Miami Music Week (MMW) with DJs spinning at various satellite pool parties and late night bashes at clubs across town. In 2015, Ultra became an 18 and over event where previously all ages were welcome.
The biggest names in EDM headline Ultra's main stage, while emerging talents and live artists are found at seven other stages throughout the park. Past headliners include Tiesto, David Guetta, AVICII, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia. Other major artists include Moby, Fatboy Slim and The Chemical Brothers. Live sets performed by such diverse artists as Snoop Dog and MIA are crowd pleasers, and Madonna even dropped in for a surprise appearance.
It's a high-energy crowd of music lovers, Spring Breakers, rave newbies and veterans coming together to jump and groove to disco, techno, dub-step, house, trance, hardcore, pop and industrial music. It's an overwhelming and euphoric experience with a sea of people dancing together while major pyrotechnics, confetti and laser lights flash to the beat of the music.
Plan Your Ultra Trip
Bayfront Park is located in the heart of Downtown Miami overlooking Biscayne Bay. There are many hotels within walking distance and others a short drive away in South Beach that are popular amongst festivalgoers. Parking can be difficult, so public transportation, taxis and shuttles are recommended. However, parking garages and valet are available. Just be prepared for traffic.
If you're heart is set on Ultra, it's smart to plan your trip in advance. Hotels are at their highest prices of the year and often sell out, so snagging a room in advance can offer peace of mind and savings. Ultra, itself, has been known to sell out and is also expensive. Weekend passes start around $300 and individual day tickets are not offered. It's smart to take advantage of early bird pricing.
At the festival, it's important to remember that temperatures are already hot in Miami in March, so dress appropriately, wear sunscreen and stay hydrated. There are multiple stations throughout the grounds to fill water bottles. Most onsite vendors only accept cash, so be prepared. Also, beware of pickpockets and keep your smartphone closely guarded.
While Ultra is no doubt the main event of the week, the entire city is filled with incredible parties and events. It's possible to see your favorite DJs in more intimate settings throughout the week, so even if you don't get a ticket to Ultra, there are plenty of reasons to visit Miami during MMW.
Tickets
Tickets to the festival sell out just about as fast as they go on sale. General admission early bird and advance tickets are available for purchase, and at a lower price, but these sell out quickly. Three-day general admission and VIP tickets are also available. For more on purchasing tickets, visit ULTRA’s ticket webpage.""" ;

Paul Ciancia agreed last week to plead guilty to all 11 charges in the rampage that killed one Transportation Security Administration officer and wounded two others and a teacher who was headed for a flight.
Ciancia, 26, was spared the death penalty by entering the plea. He faces a mandatory life term in prison.
The evidence against Ciancia was overwhelming, and included a note he wrote saying he was enraged with the airport security checks that U.S. passengers face.
Security cameras tracked Ciancia's movements as he stalked his victims with a semiautomatic rifle in Terminal 3 for 10 minutes during the Nov. 1, 2013, attack.
A TSA agent was dead and a gunman was in custody after a shooting Nov. 1, 2013, at Los Angeles International Airport that left others wounded, officials said.
He first opened fire on TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez at a document screening podium, wounding the 39-year-old married father of two children.
As Ciancia went up an escalator to the main security screening area, he saw Hernandez move and returned to fire several more shots at point-blank range, killing Hernandez.
He then went up the escalator again, through the main screening area and into a secure part of the airport and reloaded before opening fire - shooting Officers Tony Grigsby in the ankle and James Speer in the shoulder as they tried to run away. Brian Ludmer, a teacher, was hit in the calf.
Police shot and wounded Ciancia in the terminal's food court, hitting him four times. He was armed with a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic rifle he had purchased seven months earlier.
Officers found a handwritten note and ammunition in a duffel bag Ciancia had dropped.
Ciancia, who was living in the Los Angeles area after growing up in Pennsville, N.J., said in the note that he wanted to kill at least one TSA officer but hoped to kill more.
"If you want to play that game where you pretend that every American is a terrorist, you're going to learn what a self-fulfilling prophecy is," his note said, according to court documents.
The note added, "I want to instill fear in your traitorous minds. I want it to always be in the back of your head just how easy it is to take a weapon to the beginning of your Nazi checkpoints."

Attendees wearing assortments of neon and unusual party getup danced to their favorite dubstep and electronic beats at one of the park’s eight different stages surrounded by downtown buildings and the scenic Miami waterfront.
The festival’s three headliners, DJ Tiesto, Deadmau5 and The Chemical Brothers appeared at the festival’s main stage and drew in large crowds. Other notables were Rusko, Skrillex, ATB, The Disco Biscuts, Skream, Nero, STS9, Wolfgang Gartner, The Glitch Mob, Boys Noize, Crystal Castles, Steve Aoki, Conspirator and Empire of the Sun.
The festival’s vast number of attendees were felt during DJ Tiesto and Deadmau5’s sets where it was almost impossible to push through the deadlocked crowds to move closer and to find some, if any, dacning room. Smaller stages like the Tower of Ultra and the Root Society Dome yielded smaller crowds, shorter bathroom lines and room to breathe. The record attendance caused a two-hour line of people just to enter the festival at one point during the weekend.
Because of Ultra Music Festival’s increasing popularity since it first started in 2000, the 2011 festival was extended to three days when it had been only a two-day event in the past.""" ;

We would value it if we decided to return to the show
Former member of the Andorran delegation at Eurovision, Agustí Mas explained that support from the Catalan broadcaster in 2004 was much appreciated when Andorra debuted at Eurovision. TV3 worked alongside RTVA to produce the Andorran selection process for Istanbul, with viewers in Catalonia having a say in the singer that represented Andorra at the contest.
Andorra is the only country to have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest to have never competed in the Grand Final. They debuted in the contest in 2004 and participated annually until 2009.
During this period of time, Andorra came close to qualifying in 2007 when only one semi-final was held. Andorra was represented by Anonymous and the song “Salvem el món”, they finished 12th just 11 points short of qualifying.
The Director General of RTVA has previously ruled out a return to the Eurovision Song Contest or related EBU events due to the cost of participation. He explained:

Rotterdam and Maastricht are battling for the right to host the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands next year.
The 2020 Eurovision Committe consisting of NPO, AVROTROS and NOS officials visited the Rotterdam Ahoy in Rotterdam and checked out the city’s Eurovision 2020 plan of action along with the infrastructure, premises and logistics.
Mr. Said Kasmi (Rotterdam City Council) and Ms. Jolanda Jansen (Rotterdam Ahoy Director) welcomed the 2020 Eurovision delegation to Rotterdam.
Ms. Jolanda Jansen (Rotterdam Ahoy Director) says:
The meeting was incredibly substantive. First we went through the bidbook in great detail, we presented ourselves as a city and toured the premises. We spent a few hours discussing various ideas regarding the different spaces and halls.
The staff and management of the Rotterdam Ahoy has worked very hard on preparing their Eurovision bid, and put in a lot of effort to tackle the requirements to host the competition. Rotterdam Ahoy has been in contact with former Eurovision host cities: Tel Aviv, Stockholm, Vienna and Lisbon in order to get more feedback on the organization of the event.
Jansen adds:
We’ve been doing a lot of homework lately, for example we have been in touch with some of the former Eurovision venues and host cities which have organized the contest in recent years, such as Stockholm, Vienna and Lisbon. It was very good to discuss all these things with each other. A very important lesson is that all of this is greater than anything that I have ever experienced.
The City of Rotterdam is also very enthuasiastic about bringing the competition on home soil if it wins he bid.
Mr. Said Kasmi (Rotterdam Councilor for Culture) says:
We might soon host the biggest music competition, I suppose there will be 246 million viewers worldwide watching the show. All eyes that will be focused on Rotterdam and we will have lots of visitors landing in the city. We are working hard so that everything falls into place.
Rotterdam hosted the Junior ESC some years ago, NPO has not forgotten that.
Mr. Sietse Bakker (Eurovision 2020 Executive Producer) says:
The EBU has had a very good experience with the 2007 Junior Song Contest here. I think that certainly counts. Ahoy is a very nice location for three very spectacular TV shows. There are many spaces and halls in close proximity to the main hall that can house the press, delegations, production and technical teams etc.
The 2020 Eurovision Host City is expected to be unveiled by mid August.

Eurovision fans have been eagerly awaiting to see a new country debut in the Eurovision Song Contest, the last time we saw a new nation debut in our beloved contest was in 2015 when Austalia debuted in our beloved contest.
The Liechtesnteiner broadcaster told ESCToday that it will not participate at the 2020 Eurovision edition next year.
Liechtenstein’s Eurovision dream
The broadcaster was vying to become an EBU member and compete in the Eurovision Song Contest, but its plans were suddbenly halted due to Mr. Peter Kolbel ‘s (1 FLT TV director) untimely demise last year. Mr. Kolbel was working earnestly in order to bring the landlocked country to the Eurovision Song Contest.
The Liechtensteiner broadcaster is not an active member of the EBU, thus it is not eligible to participate in the contest currently. Therefore it has to become a full EBU Member in order to partake in the competition.
Financial hurdles
The broadcaster faces 2 major challenges in order to fulfill its wish to participate at the Eurovision Song Contest in the future; it requires the support from the government and to solve the financial constraint an EBU membership entails, not forgetting the costs of a Eurovision participation.
Once it overcomes these hurdles and it becomes an active member of the EBU, we will possibly see Liechtenstein join the Eurovision family!
The landlocked country has a rich musical heritage and has many talented singers, musicians, choirs and orchestras.
Three years ago, 1 FL TV told ESCToday that Liechtenstein was interested in participating in the contest but had to evaluate the financial costs an EBU membership entails.

All we know so far is that it’s scheduled to last a whole two minutes. Later at night, 7:58 PM, the broadcast will be repeated.

Both venues, Ahoy Rotterdam and MECC Maastricht, were visited more than once. Near the end of the decision process, the organisers asked both cities to supply more information.

While no official reason has been given for the withdrawal, the move comes amid an increase in homophobic rhetoric in Hungary, where the anti-migration prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has launched a “family first” policy aimed at helping traditional families and boosting birth rates.
Earlier this year, the speaker of the Hungarian parliament compared same-sex adoption to paedophilia, while a pro-government television commentator referred to Eurovision as “a homosexual flotilla” and said not participating would benefit the nation’s mental health.
A source inside the Hungarian public broadcaster, MTVA, told the Guardian that while no reason was communicated internally for the decision to withdraw from the contest, the assumption among employees was that Eurovision’s association with LGBTQ+ culture was behind the move.
“I was not surprised. It comes from the organisational culture of MTVA,” said the source, adding that positive coverage of LGBT rights at the media holding was discouraged, save for annual coverage of Budapest Pride.
Public media in Hungary is closely linked to the government and has been instrumental in spreading its messages around migration and other issues. Earlier, the Hungarian website index.hu quoted unnamed sources inside public media speculating that the reason for the withdrawal was likely to be that Eurovision was deemed “too gay”.
Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, described the index.hu story as “fake news” on Twitter, but did not specify any other reason for Hungary’s non-participation.
In an emailed statement to the Guardian, MTVA said: “Instead of taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2020, we will support the valuable productions created by the talents of Hungarian pop music directly.”
In previous years, the winner of a series called The Song would go on to become Hungary’s Eurovision entry. This year the programme will continue but the prize will be a chance to appear on various domestic media outlets and at festivals.
MTVA did not respond to a question on the reasons for the decision.
Orbán has steered clear of incendiary homophobic rhetoric, although he has repeatedly emphasised his view that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. But in recent months the homophobia among the prime minister’s inner circle has ratcheted up.
An MP from Orbán’s Fidesz party called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after the brand launched an advertising campaign using photographs of a gay couple, while László Kövér, the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, compared proponents of equal marriage and adoption to paedophiles. “Morally, there is no difference between the behaviour of a paedophile and the behaviour of someone who demands such things,” he said.
Kövér contrasted those who wanted same-sex adoption rights to a putative “normal homosexual” who understood his lower status in the world. “He tries to fit into this world while he doesn’t necessarily think he is equal,” said Kövér.
Last week, an opposition MP asked a government minister what the reason for the Eurovision withdrawal was, and was told it was a decision taken by public media with no government input. But the link was drawn explicitly on pro-government television shows.
“I welcome the decision, including from a mental health perspective, that Hungary will not take part in the homosexual flotilla that this international song competition has been reduced to,” said András Bencsik, the editor of a pro-government magazine and frequent TV commentator.
“Many young people thought that this is something for people under 18, but at this event the destruction of public taste takes place with screaming transvestites and bearded women.”
The scandal recalls opposition to Eurovision in Russia, where a homophobic MP called for the country to withdraw in 2014, saying that participating would “contradict the path of cultural and moral renewal that Russia stands on today”.
The European Broadcasting Union, which runs the contest, said: “It is not uncommon for EBU members to have breaks in participation in the Eurovision song contest,” and pointed out that Hungary had been absent on previous occasions. However, since 2011, the country has entered every year.
“We hope to welcome their broadcaster MTVA back to the Eurovision song contest family soon,” the EBU said.""" ;

But now the speculation continues, as Austrian media reports that R&B singer Vincent Bueno is, in fact, the act who’ll be heading to Rotterdam in May.
The Austrian newspaper Österreich reports that singer-songwriter Vincent Bueno has been internally selected to represent Austria at Eurovision 2020.
Vincent is no stranger to the Eurovision stage. In 2017, he supported Nathan Trent on backing vocals for “Running On Air”. Vincent also produced the remixed Spanish-language version of the song for Nathan, titled “Aire”.
Broadcaster ORF has not yet made any statement regarding their artist for Eurovision 2020. Based on previous years, it is possible that the broadcaster will announce their act for Rotterdam sometime in coming weeks.
Watch Vincent accompany Nathan Trent on an acoustic performance of “Running On Air” in Kyiv:
Who is Vincent Bueno?
Vincent Bueno is an Austrian-born singer of Filipino ethnicity. He came to fame in 2008 when he won the Austrian talent show Musical! Die Show. The show aimed to find the next Austrian star of musical theatre.
The following year, he competed on Dancing Stars, where he placed seventh. In 2010, Vincent travelled to the Philippines where he appeared on the popular variety show ASAP XV.
Vincent also had a previous attempt at representing Austria at Eurovision. In 2016 he competed in the last Austrian national final with the dance song “All We Need Is that Love”. It received a mid-table score from the jury and didn’t make it to the superfinal.
Vincent has released plenty of solo material, including recent single “Into You”. It has a cool, contemporary R&B sound and could be a sign of the sort of song Vincent might take to Rotterdam. And it’s evidence that he can rap as well as sing.
There’s another side of Vincent — the family man. Earlier this year, Vincent and his wife Charity Grace — performing as The Buenos — released the hilarious but sweet song “I Still See You”. The song celebrates a relationship surviving despite the demands of parenthood.
Austria has had mixed fortunes at Eurovision in recent years. After Conchita Wurst’s win in 2014, The Makemakes went the other way with nil points in 2015. Zoe and Nathan Trent placed 13th and 16th respectively in their years. Cesár Sampson enjoyed a triumphant third place in 2018, but Paenda failed to qualify in Tel Aviv.
What do you think? Should ORF send Vincent Bueno to Rotterdam? What sort of song should he perform? Tell us your thoughts below!

As usual, the EBU is releasing the official Eurovision Song Contest 2020 CD album with all 41 of the songs that were scheduled to be performed in Rotterdam during the 65th edition of the song contest.
Eurovision Song Contest CD album to be released 8 May
For some Eurovision fans, buying the official album is a yearly routine and some have a collection of albums that stretches back to the very first album released in 2000.
Usually, the official CD is in stock in April. Since the release date of the album had not been announced yet, fans were wondering whether there would be a CD at all. Well don’t worry, there will be!
The official album is already available to pre-order at the Eurovision Song Contest web shop and will be released on 8 May. The album will cost you €19.95.
Get a free #OpenUp coaster set with your purchase
If you pre-order from the official web shop, you will not only receive the CD, but also a free ten-piece coaster set with the #OpenUp theme printed on each one.
While you might not be able to use your coaster set to have a Eurovision party this year, there are plenty of other things you can do with the coaster set. If you glue all the coasters together, you can use them as a measuring stick showing you the required social distance you need to keep between yourself and others during these difficult times.
You can of course also use the coasters as blades to throw at those who do not keep their social distance from you, but we don’t recommend that.
On a more serious note, we love this year’s songs and are looking forward to hearing them on the official album!

From Thursday 12 March 2020 new measures apply in the Netherlands to stop the spread of coronavirus. Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Minister for Medical Care Bruno Bruins announced the measures at a press conference. The measures are based on the advice of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).
For everyone in the Netherlands: stay at home if you have a cold, a cough, a sore throat or a fever. Avoid contact with others (social distancing). Only call your doctor if your symptoms worsen.
Gatherings of more than 100 people are to be cancelled throughout the Netherlands. This includes the closure of public places such as museums, concert venues, theatres, sports clubs and the cancellation of sports matches and other events.
People throughout the Netherlands are encouraged to work from home or stagger their working times if possible.
For vulnerable people (the elderly and those with weakened immune systems): avoid large gatherings and public transport. People in general are urged to limit visits to vulnerable persons.
For healthcare workers and staff in other crucial sectors: a lot is being asked of you. You should stay at home only if you have symptoms including a fever. If necessary, consult with your employer. Please do not travel abroad.
Universities and institutions of higher professional education (HBO) are requested to offer online lectures instead of large-scale lectures.
Primary schools, secondary schools, secondary vocational schools (MBO) and childcare centres will remain open as usual. There have been only few infections there and these environments are less international. Children and young people are not high-risk groups. Closing schools would have a major impact on society without contributing significantly to reducing the spread of coronavirus. Children who have symptoms of a cold should stay at home.
Important: these measures apply until 31 March 2020 (inclusive) throughout the Netherlands, including in North Brabant.
From Thursday 12 March onwards new information will be added here. The questions and answers on www.government.nl/coronavirus will also be updated.

That’s because RÚV, Iceland’s national broadcaster, has announced its schedule for alternative Eurovision 2020 shows.
RÚV will, of course, broadcast the official EBU alternative show Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, which airs on Saturday May 16, the night the actual final was due to be broadcast. But on top of that RÚV will be producing their own alternative version of a Eurovision show.
This will include annual panel show Alla leið (that’s English for “All the way”), which will be used as an alternative to the jury vote. There will also be a public vote where Icelanders can vote for their favourite, which will be used as an alternative televote.
On April 18 the first show of Alla leið was broadcast, with three others shows coming on the next three Saturday evenings. The panel of the show will be used as an alternative jury which will comprise 50% of the alternative voting. On May 2 the Icelandic public can start voting for their favourite song out of all the ones that were to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. This vote will weigh in as the other 50% of the alternative voting.
On May 14 RÚV will broadcast a show where the 15 top songs will be played and the Icelandic public given a chance to vote for their favourite again. In the end we will have the song that would have, or maybe more than might have, gotten the famous douze points from Iceland in the actual Eurovision of 2020.
RÚV had already announced that they would continue with their annual panel show Alla leið where all the Eurovision songs are reviewed by a panel of judges who try to predict which songs make it all the way to the final each year.
The show is hosted by Felix Bergsson, Iceland’s Head of Delegation, who is accompanied by Björg Magnúsdóttir, one of the presenters of Söngvakeppnin 2020. Felix oversees the panel part of the show, whilst Björg gets prominent people from Eurovision and Söngvakeppnin to reminisce on their Eurovision experience.

The BBC has announced an extensive schedule of Eurovision-related programming across TV and radio. It mixes original programming made for 2020 and programmes pulled from the archives to help get y’all through the next few weeks.
British Eurofans will be particularly excited to hear that the official EBU replacement show Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light will get primetime billing on BBC One, rather than being relegated to BBC iPlayer. You’ll recall that fans were up-in-arms when it seemed the shoe was destined for the online streaming site rather than traditional telly.
The BBC’s original production Eurovision: Come Together will air on BBC One from 18:30 local time on BBC One. The EBU’s Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light will follow at 20:00.
At 22:00 Rylan will host a special highlights show on BBC Two called The A-Z of Eurovision, which “takes a sideways look at the greatest singing contest on the planet.” And, wrapping up an extensive evening of Eurovision coverage, BBC Two will re-air a Eurovision-themed edition of Top of the Pops 2, which first aired in 2007.
The details are long and extensive, so we’re re-publishing the BBC press release in full below.
BBC Eurovision 2020 programming schedule
The contest might not be going as planned this year, but we are promising plenty of Eurovision content across TV, Radio and Online in celebration of the biggest music competition in the world.
From a night of special programmes celebrating this year’s contest on BBC One, to revisiting classic moments on BBC Two and a host of specially themed programmes and treats from the archives to enjoy on BBC Radio 2, there will be a wealth of Eurovision content for you to look forward to this May.
Eurovision: Come Together – 6.30pm on Saturday 16 May on BBC One
Graham Norton will be on hand to kick off a night of Eurovision fun on BBC One on Saturday 16th May.
In this one-off special from BBC Studios, Graham will give UK viewers the opportunity to take part in a live vote to crown their favourite Eurovision performance from an eclectic short list compiled by experts and celebrity super fans. Graham will also have a chat with James Newman, the act who was due to fly the UK flag in The Netherlands in 2020.
Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light – 8pm on Saturday 16 May on BBC One
Following Eurovision: Come Together, BBC One will be broadcasting Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, which will honour all 41 songs that would have competed in the 2020 contest but in a non-competitive format, as well as providing plenty of surprises for fans and viewers at home. Just like the contest itself, the live show will be simultaneously broadcast across Europe and beyond and will be hosted by the original Dutch presenters for Eurovision Song Contest 2020 Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley and Jan Smit from The Netherlands.
There will also be an unforgettable virtual sing-a-long where fans from across the world will dress up and form a huge Eurovision choir performing Johnny Logan’s winning song for Ireland in 1980, ‘What’s Another Year’.
Graham Norton will provide live commentary.
The A-Z of Eurovision – 10pm on Saturday 16 May on BBC Two
Rylan Clark-Neal narrates a guide to all things Eurovision in this brand new compilation of highlights from BBC Studios as he takes a sideways look at the greatest singing contest on the planet.
Moving through the alphabet, Rylan will be taking us from A, which is of course for Abba & Azerbaijan but also animals – featuring the Italian gorilla man and Azerbaijan’s backing dancer wearing a horse’s head through Z is for Zelmerlöw, Måns Zelmerlöw to be precise. The only Eurovision performer to have won the contest, hosted the contest and taken part in an interval act.
The A-Z of Eurovision will feature all the memorable musical moments from 65 years of Eurovision.
TOTP2 Goes Eurovision! 10.30pm on Saturday 16 May on BBC Two
First shown ahead of the 2007 Contest, Steve Wright introduces a special Eurovision-themed edition of the show, featuring archive songs by stars of the famous competition. Artists include Cliff Richard, Lulu, Bucks Fizz, Sandie Shaw, Brotherhood of Man, Johnny Logan and Abba, plus 2007’s UK entrants, Scooch.
Eurovision at 60 – 9.30pm on Friday 15 May on BBC Four
First shown to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest’s 60th anniversary in 2015, BBC Four joins the celebrations with an appreciation of the joy, madness, scandal and intrigue that has defined the Eurovision Song Contest.
It’s a story of pioneering songs, singers and programme makers; complex and extraordinary technology, laborious voting and a bit of naughtiness. Above all, it can be argued that Eurovision is a symbol of tolerance. As Graham Norton says of Conchita Wurst’s 2014 win: “The people had spoken…and they were nicer and more tolerant people than their governments let us think.”
Featuring interviews with Graham Norton, Conchita Wurst, Sir Terry Wogan and a whole host of Eurovision stars, songwriters and programme makers.
Dana – The Original Derry Girl – BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday 11 May at 10.45pm and 11pm on Friday 15 May on BBC Four
Fifty years ago, an 18-year-old schoolgirl left the Bogside and headed off to Amsterdam to represent Ireland in the 15th Eurovision Song Contest. What happened that night was to change her life forever.
Dana – The Original Derry Girl on BBC One Northern Ireland, is a look back at that young schoolgirl’s incredible life story, retracing her steps to the stage of the RAI theatre, where against the odds she became Ireland’s first Eurovision winner.
Eurovision 2020 The Cancelled Coronavirus Year – BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat – available from 6am on Monday 11 May on BBC iPlayer
Filming for this exclusive behind the scenes documentary began back in February – before it was revealed that the 2020 Eurovision song contest in Rotterdam was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat follows James Newman as he prepares to be unveiled as the UK’s Eurovision representative, filming him in rehearsals, and backstage at his first public performance of his Eurovision entry, accompanied by his brother, artist John Newman and their mum.
Following the cancellation of Eurovision, James shares what this means for him and he speaks to some of this year’s other contestants in other countries about their experiences and future plans. The documentary features commentary from artists who have worked with James, including Olly Murs, Mollie King and Piers from Rudimental.
BBC Radio 2 will be bringing the spirit of Eurovision to listeners, and all the programmes are also available on BBC Sounds. On Ken Bruce’s mid- morning weekday show, the featured album of the week will be Eurovision 2020 – the official compilation album of the artists and songs from the contest – plus clips from previous winners and their entries will be broadcast (Monday 11th May, 9.30am-12pm).
Ahead of his tv show on Saturday night, in the morning Graham Norton will be getting listeners into the Eurovision spirit by playing some of contest’s finest songs, both past and present (Saturday 16th May, 10am- 1pm). And later that night is another chance to hear Graham Norton, Douze Points in which he looks back on his first ten years as UK Commentator of the Eurovision Song Contest. From Moscow in 2009, to last year’s show in Tel Aviv, he remembers the big winners and the artists the UK sent, from Blue to Electro Velvet. Along with super fan Paddy O’Connell, he also recalls the controversies and triumphs, shocks and surprises… and that infamous stage invasion in Lisbon, 2018 (Saturday 16 May, 9-10pm,).
Afterwards, Rylan Clark-Neal presents Eurovision Kings and Queens of Pop where he’ll be selecting his choice of the greatest Eurovision moments from the history of the competition and his favourite songs that would have been a part of this year’s event in Rotterdam. Also packed with nostalgic tracks the show features Eurovision favourites including Abba, Sandie Shaw, Bucks Fizz, Mans Zelmerlow, Netta, Celine Dion, Gina G, Dana International, Katrina and The Waves, Conchita Wurst, and last year’s winner Duncan Laurence who triumphed for the Netherlands with his song, Arcade. Plus there are joyous hand-picked archive clips from the BBC vaults (Saturday 16th May, 10pm-midnight).
Additionally, there will a Eurovision Collection broadcast on Radio 2 and on BBC Sounds, featuring fantastic programmes from the archive. In From ABBA to Azerbaijan (56 Years of Eurovision), Maria McErlane is the listeners’ tour guide to 56 years of the Eurovision Song Contest (Saturday 16th May, 3-4am); Ken Bruce’s Ultimate Eurovision Chart celebrates 60 years of the Eurovision Song Contest, counting down the Top 40 all-time favourite Eurovision winning songs as voted for by Radio 2 listeners (Sunday 17th May, 2-4am); and Let’s Abba Party marks the twentieth anniversary of hit stage musical, Mamma Mia!, with Nicki Chapman presenting a two-hour special featuring a non-stop mix of classic hits, covers, and selections from the cast recordings and film soundtracks (Sunday 17th May, 5-7pm).
All programming will be available on catch-up on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.

UMK 2021 will also be held as an open contest.
The sensitive pop ballad Looking Back will be heard as Finland’s entry in Rotterdam in May 2020. The Finnish people and an international jury chose the winner in the final of UMK, broadcast live on Saturday, 7 March at Mediapolis in Tampere.
The winning performance
Looking Back is the result of a collaboration between Joonas Angeria and Whitney Phillips, as well as brothers Connor, Toby and Riley McDonough. Angeria, from Finland, has made music for Finnish and international stars like Alma, Vesala, Julie Bergan and Isac Elliot. Whitney Phillips has written songs for Christina Aguilera and Zara Larsson, among other artists. Connor, Toby and Riley McDonough are behind the American pop rock band Before You Exit.
– The song is a combination of love and world-weariness. It describes how people can get disappointed with expectations. I want to make people understand that they should seize the day, said Aksel at the beginning of his UMK journey.
This year, the Eurovision Song Contest will be held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in May 2020. The Finnish representative will be on stage in the second semi-final on 14 May 2020. The final will take place on Saturday, 16 May 2020, and it will be shown live on Yle TV1 and in the Yle Areena streaming service.
– Finland’s team aims to get to the final with a positive attitude. The same top team that was involved in the UMK performance will be responsible for the show in the Eurovision Song Contest, says the happy UMK producer Anssi Autio.
The winner’s and other UMK finalists’ performances are available on Yle Areena.

UMK continues to be an open contest
The 2021 Contest for New Music will also be open. Cooperation with YleX continues too.
– The music business and the audience have welcomed the open contest very warmly, and it was wonderful to see leading Finnish songwriters take part in UMK with great songs. As a result, we had an exciting high-quality final. It’s a pleasure to see YleX and UMK continue their collaboration. We will start searching for new pieces of music in September, so you should start writing new songs this spring, says Tapio Hakanen, Head of Music at YleX.
UMK’s application process for 2021 will begin in September 2020. More information about the application process will be provided, for example, on the UMK website.""" ;

Eurovision: Come Together saw the public vote for their favourites, on the night that this year's song contest was due to take place.
The 2020 competition was cancelled in March amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Swedish foursome won it in 1974 in Brighton. The track, which topped the UK charts and set them on their way to fame, went on to sell nearly 6m copies.
Speaking later on the night, Bjorn Ulvaeus from the band said he found it "hard to believe" that was where it began for them all those years ago.
The shortlist for the programme included Eurovision classics from the likes of Netta, Bucks Fizz, Conchita Wurst and Gina G.
But it was Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny and Bjorn who ultimately triumphed, with their musical metaphor about the joys of surrendering to love.
The 19-strong song list was compiled by Eurovision experts and broadcasters, including Rylan Clark-Neal, Scott Mills, Ken Bruce, Adele Roberts and Mel Giedroyc, as well as former UK acts SuRie and Nicki French.
Presenter Graham Norton upheld the tradition of raising a glass to the late Sir Terry Wogan, who hosted the contest for nearly 30 years.
"We couldn't deny you your Eurovision fix," he declared.
The programme also showcased what would have been the UK entry this year - James Newman's My Last Breath - and Norton spoke to the singer via video link.
Newman said he was "pretty gutted" and "had to have a few minutes to myself" when he found out the contest had been cancelled.
Image caption James Newman was due to represent the UK at this year's contest
He said the staging had already been planned and showed an image of an underwater scene leading down from some steps.
Newman added that his favourite Eurovision entry this year was Iceland's - it was one of the favourites to win had the competition gone ahead, according to recent Spotify streaming figures.
Later on on Saturday evening, the BBC also joined with other European broadcasters for Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, to honour all 41 songs which would have competed this year.
Some of this year's songs would have been eliminated at the semi-finals, where the entrants are normally whittled down to 26 but the semis were also cancelled.
The event was hosted from the Dutch city of Hilversum - an hour away from where the contest was due to take place in Rotterdam - while Norton popped up again as the UK's commentator, and acts appeared in various forms from across the continent.
Eight highlights from Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Europe Shine A Light: Highlights from the Eurovision celebration show
1. Another Swedish act's tribute
Måns Zelmerlöw sang an acoustic version of Heroes, his winning song from 2015, in homage to health workers during the coronavirus pandemic.
2. Fans answered Ireland's (video) call
Double Eurovision winner, Ireland's Johnny Logan, was joined by scores of fans via video-link for a rendition of his most relevantly-titled track, What's Another Year.
3. Love shone its light, not once but twice
The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra combined (again, via the wonders of modern technology) to perform an instrumental version of the UK's 1997-winning Love Shine a Light, by Katrina and the Waves, as the broadcasters showed images of iconic music venues around the world lighting up.
This was certainly a high point for another former UK contestant SuRie, who said she had been left "broken" by the performance… in a good way.
The track got another airing for the show's finale, but this time with the lyrics too, as performers from all countries sang along in unison.
4. There were FIVE Daði Freyr Péturssons
Iceland's eccentric performer urged us all to "stay healthy" and "stay fabulous" with the help of a barbershop quartet, comprised of different digital versions of himself, all wearing the same sweater bearing an image of, yep, you guessed it... him again.
TV critic Scott Bryan, for one, enjoyed it.
5. A socially-distanced 'mass' gathering took place
Michael Schulte, Germany's entrant in 2018, and 2014 Dutch act The Common Linnets came together for a socially-distanced and fairly biblical looking grand church service-style rendition of Nicole's 1982 winning song Ein Bisschen Frieden.
6. Conchita went commando
The Austrian singer and drag act Conchita Wurst, who won in 2014, confessed that the "most beautiful" part of the coronavirus lockdown was the fact, "I hardly wear any underwear and I love it so much".
7. Graham Norton got delayed
The UK broadcaster admitted, "there's no denying this is a very odd programme" - referring to the lack of an actual competition this year, for the first time since the contest began in 1956.
It got even odder as he had to take part in a live two-way chat with the Dutch hosts, with a bit of a delay. "That was awkward," he joked, but he also said the show as a whole had "real emotion".
8. Bjorn was 'happy' to forget about you know what for a wee while
Abba were the winners who took it all in the earlier BBC poll, and there was a rare TV appearance from the aforementioned Bjorn in the Shine A Light show.
After recounting a sweet tale about the time his grandson Albert first realised his grandad was a Eurovision pop star, he described the contest as one of the most "genuinely joyous events of the TV year" which "allows you to escape and be happy and even forget about the coronavirus for a little while".
The show featured messages of love and support from all of the acts who would have featured in the competition. Some viewers though, it seems, would have preferred more action and less well-wishing.
"I miss when Eurovision was fun," wrote one Twitter user. "A chance to escape everything else. Yes the world is in a terrible place but the title is Shine a Light, not doom."
"They have badly judged what we all wanted," offered another. "We wanted a party, even a Zoom party would have done, but this is a bit depressing.
Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James, however, thought the show's producers hit all the right notes.
"Don't know about anyone else but I'm pretty emotional watching this," she posted.

None of the 2020 songs will be carried over to next year. Instead, countries will select new entrants for the 2021 contest.
Several countries - including Greece, Spain and Bulgaria - have confirmed they will send the same acts next year to give the artists a second chance, but they will have to perform different songs.
Currently, there's no word on whether the UK's 2020 entrant James Newman will be chosen for the 2021 contest, although he has said he "absolutely" wants to represent his country again.
It was confirmed that Rotterdam, which missed out this year, would indeed be allowed to host the show in 2021 instead.

With the Miami Music Week currently in full effect and the official countdown to Ultra Music Festival approaching its peak, there is an amazing amount of music news to cover.

That’s because Leeuwarden has today withdrawn from the bidding process due to the ceiling height of the proposed venue.
The WTC Expo roof is too low and local government has now determined it can’t be raised in time for Eurovision.
Update:
Hours after Leeuwarden announced they will withdraw due to their venue roof being too low, the city of Maastricht has come forward. Dutch outlet 1Limberg reports that the ceiling of Maastricht’s venue the Maastricht (MECC) is also too low to meet the regulations.
Maastricht’s ceiling is 12 centimeters below the regulations. However, 1Limberg reports the NPO says this is not a problem for Maastricht.
Director of the MECC Rob van de Wiel says, “We would not do this (bid for Eurovision) if we did not meet the requirements. There is no reservation whatsoever.”
Venues must meet a limit of 18 metres. Leeuwarden’s withdrawal has not referenced the exact height of their ceiling.
Speaking to Dutch outlet AD, Deputy Mayor Sjoerd Feitsma says the withdrawal is a “pity”:
“We knew from the start that the height of the WTC Expo could be a bottleneck. But you don’t miss out on the chance to bring a Eurovision Song Contest to your city. That is why we have applied ourselves with full conviction.”
The news is doubly frustrating for Leeuwarden, in light of the fact the city met all the other requirements:
“The height of the room is actually the only requirement that we cannot meet. We were confident that we could continue to manage the organization.”
Even before the Dutch broadcaster sent its’ list of demands for candidate cities, the roof issue had been investigated.
Unfortunately over the weekend it emerged raising the roof in time for the contest will not be realistic.
The NPO responded to the news to thank Leeuwarden for it’s interest:
“We as an organization are happy that the cities / regions have responded so enthusiastically,” said a spokesperson for the NPO.
The NPO, together with AVROTROS, NOS and the EBU is responsible for organizing the contest in the Netherlands.
Local government will now investigate whether it can create live viewing areas in the city to broadcast the contest in May 2020.
The withdrawal leaves eight cities in contention to host. They are: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Arnhem, Den Bosch, Maastricht, Breda, The Hague and Rotterdam.

As you’re all well aware, several Dutch cities wanted to host ESC 2020, but only two of them are still left in the race: Maastricht and Rotterdam. We already knew the winner would be revealed on the 30th of August. And now we know when and where the announcement will take place. Dutch broadcaster NPO has revealed on its web site that it has reserved a slot on NPO1 to announce whether MECC Maastricht or Ahoy Rotterdam will have the honour of hosting the event. The prize for the winning venue is massive exposure — around 200 million people will tune in to see the show unfold.
In the past, Eurovision winner Duncan Laurence has admitted that he prefers Rotterdam over Maastricht because it’s closer to where he grew up.
Will Duncan announce the host city?
Eagle-eyed Eurovision fans spotted Duncan filming videos in both Maastricht and Rotterdam earlier this summer. The chances are that these were announcement videos filmed in advance, and that one of them will be shown during the two-minute broadcast. The announcement will come just before NOS Journaal, the most-watched news broadcast in the country. A spokesperson for NPO said that more information would be shared during the week about what the announcement will look like. They may also make clear what will be broadcast later in the evening at 7:58pm.
Host city problems solved
MECC director Rob van de Wiel remains hopeful about Maastricht’s bid, following NPO’s recent call for additional information about logistics and stage rafters. After the selection committee’s visit to the MECC, he announced that manufacturers still had to consider the load-bearing capacity of the trusses which help support the roof. When asked whether that was solved, he said: “The bid book and the cooperation agreement have been submitted — that says enough.” Rotterdam also had to submit a supplement to their proposal, but Ahoy has not made any statements about this so far.
No visit from the EBU
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is responsible for the Eurovision Song Contest shows and the TV broadcast, has not yet visited Maastricht or Rotterdam. According to a spokesperson for the EBU, the organization requires the Dutch broadcasters NPO, NOS and AVROTROS to first submit at least two cities with suitable locations. The EBU is then involved in the final choice. “In this case, it is not necessary to visit the candidate cities before the decision is made. In recent years the EBU has visited candidate cities in Israel and Ukraine, but not in Portugal and Sweden.”

Today the Director-General of RTCG has hit back, saying that the broadcaster has not yet made a decision regarding its participation in Rotterdam.
Speaking to Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti, RTCG’s Director-General Božidar Sundic said:
“I do not know who provided this information, but it cannot be accurate and official because we cannot talk about Eurovision before the RTCG Council decision. The Director-General cannot make that decision on his own, but he gives an order to the Council, whose session is officially decided on.”
Sundic also told the newspaper that he expected the RTCG Council would meet within a few days.
Mixed messages
The claim was first made by the Eurovision insider gossip blog HOD45, followed by the Greek Eurovision fan blog Eurovision Fun.
Reputable Eurovision news blog ESCToday then followed up with a representative of the broadcaster who confirmed to ESCToday that RTCG had withdrawn their application for Eurovision 2020.
The EBU reportedly gave RTCG an extension to finalise its participation, but it was unable to “meet the requirements” and so withdrew. ESCToday reported that RTCG “tried its very best to compete in Rotterdam but things didn’t materialise in the end.”
Wiwibloggs has also heard from two well-placed sources who say that Montenegro is indeed withdrawing.
Prior to Sundic’s comment, no one from RTCG had publicly spoken on the issue.
The EBU is expected to release the list of confirmed acts for Eurovision 2020 sometime in the next few weeks, which should settle the question of Montenegro’s participation in Rotterdam.
Montenegro at Eurovision
This won’t be the first occasion Montenegro has taken time off from the song contest. After debuting as an independent nation in 2007 and competing three times, Montenegro didn’t participate in 2010 and 2011, also for financial reasons.
Montenegro’s best years at Eurovision were 2014 and 2015, where Sergej Ćetković and Knez each made it to the grand final with emotional ballads in the Montenegrin language. Knez’s song “Adio” finished in 13th place in the grand final, giving Montenegro its best-ever result.

Now broadcaster MRT has confirmed the next artist who will represent the country. Macedonian singer Vasil Garvanliev will be North Macedonia’s act for Eurovision 2020.
Vasil has previously been hotly tipped to represent North Macedonia at Eurovision. One year ago, we included him on our Eurovision wishlist for North Macedonia. But now the speculation has become a reality.
In a statement, Vasil spoke about his excitement. He said: “I am beyond honoured to present my country at the Song Contest in Rotterdam and I can hardly wait to put all my experience and knowledge into creating a magical journey that will touch people’s heart across Europe.”
Vasil is no stranger to Eurovision. In Tel Aviv he was one of three backing vocalists who helped Tamara Todevska win the Eurovision jury vote en route to securing North Macedonia’s best-ever finish.
Vasil’s song for Eurovision 2020 will be released at a future date.
Who is Vasil Garvanliev? Meet North Macedonia’s Eurovision 2020 star
Vasil was born and raised in North Macedonia. He began inching toward celebrity as a child, having made his professional stage debut at the age of seven. But during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s, his family fled to the United States. He eventually established himself as an opera singer in Canada.
But he’s not just limited to opera. In 2016, Vasil contributed backing vocals to several tracks on Chance the Rapper’s critically acclaimed album Coloring Book.
Now back in North Macedonia, Vasil is focusing on his own solo music career. In October, he released his single “Patuvam”. The song takes traditional Balkan sounds but builds a contemporary track — one that comes with flourishes of dance and pop.
Vasil explained it to us like this:
“‘Patuvam’ is a celebration of love through dance and voguing. Getting in touch with your inner child who is made of pure curiosity and love, ready to take on any challenge in the world. The lyrics go like, ‘I travel with an empty backpack but a full soul. I travel where the dream is a dream come true.’ […] In Macedonian media, many critics are already reviewing this as the first brave and bold move in queer culture and freedom.”
When wiwibloggs met Vasil Garvanliev
Wiwibloggs first met Vasil last year in Tel Aviv, where he was supporting Tamara Todevska. During our interview with him, the singer oozed quiet confidence and self-assurance. He seemed largely unfazed by all the hoopla surrounding North Macedonia’s 2019 entry and was focused on the music.
“Everyone keeps saying it’s a feminine song — women, women, women,” he said. “So from a guy perspective, it’s much deeper than that. Be proud of who you are, where you come from, what you have to say. I always say if you come from truth, this truth inside of you, no one can touch you.”

Stefania’s song for Rotterdam is called “SUPERG!RL” and it will be released in coming weeks.
The announcement was made by ERT on their evening news broadcast. The confirmation follows much speculation that Stefania was under consideration as Greece’s act for Eurovision 2020. But now the ticket to Rotterdam is officially hers.
Stefania shared the news on her Instagram, writing, “I will proudly represent my country GREECE in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam!! It’s so crazy to realize that this dream has actually come true!!”
Stefania’s song “SUPERGIRL” has been written by Eurovision veteran Dimitris Kontopoulos, Greek production team Arcade and “Scream” lyricist Sharon Vaughn. The staging will be done by famed choreographer Fokas Evangelinos. Together, Kontopoulos and Evangelinos are part of the so-called “Dream Team”, behind some of the most iconic Eurovision performances from the past 15 years.
This won’t be the first Eurovision experience for Stefania. In 2016 she represented the Netherlands at Junior Eurovision as part of the girl trio Kisses. The group placed eighth with their song “Kisses and Dancin'”.
Stefania joins a growing list of Junior Eurovision stars who returned to try their luck on the Eurovision Song Contest stage. These stars include Russia’s Tolmachevy Sisters, the Dutch sisters O’G3NE, and most recently, Serbia’s Nevena Božović.
Who is Stefania? Get to know Greece’s Eurovision 2020 star
Stefania Liberakakis is a Dutch-born singer and actor, with Greek ancestry. She’s been on our radar since July as a potential act for Eurovision 2020.
Stefania came to fame in 2014, when she participated in the Dutch version of The Voice Kids. After wowing judges with her audition performance of Alicia Keys’ “No One”, Stefania made it as far as the Battle round before being eliminated. She also sang as part of the Dutch children’s choir Kinderen voor Kinderen.
In 2016, Stefania represented The Netherlands at Junior Eurovision in Malta, as part of the three-piece girl group Kisses. Their upbeat song “Kisses and Dancin’” placed eighth in the contest.
More recently, Stefania has turned her efforts to her solo pop career. Last month, Stefania released “Turn Around”, a sophisticated contemporary pop track.
Stefania has also been working on her pop career in Greece. Last year, she performed at the Mad VMA music awards, as part of an all-girl cover of Daddy Yankee’s “Con calma”. The video of the performance has clocked up over 2.5 million views, inspiring comments from fans wanting Stefania for Eurovision.
Stefania’s song for Eurovision 2020, “SUPERGIRL” will be released in coming weeks.

Announced by the EBU on March 3, the restrictions are a precautionary move against the spread of coronavirus.
The ban has been introduced after an EBU employee in Switzerland was confirmed to have contracted the virus. Eurovision delegations were informed on Tuesday morning.
That news was not earlier reported in the Swedish press coverage of Sweden’s withdrawal from the Heads of Delegation meeting. However, wiwibloggs has now obtained — from multiple sources — a copy of the letter sent from the EBU to delegations:
“As some of you may already be aware, the EBU in Geneva has had one person test positive for coronavirus amongst its staff.”
As a result of that, the EBU’s general director “in the interests of health and safety of staff and Members, has imposed travel restrictions on all staff until at least Friday 13 March.”
Staff affected include Eurovision Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand. The letter goes on to say that Sand will not attend the HoD meeting, but will join it remotely.
Israel pulls out of Heads of Delegation Meeting
First it was Sweden. And now Israel. Last year’s Eurovision host nation will not be at the Heads of Delegation either, as the coronavirus continues to spread.
Like Swedish broadcaster SVT, Israel’s KAN has decided not to attend the meeting next Monday in Rotterdam. This is due to advice from Israel’s Health Ministry to avoid unnecessary travel.
The Ministry of Health has advised Israelis against travel abroad except in “urgent” cases. Sources within the Israeli broadcaster confirmed the Ministry’s directive as the reason for cancellation to Ynet. wiwibloggs has confirmed the news independently with sources at the broadcaster.
That does not mean Israel won’t be at Eurovision: KAN still intends to compete in Rotterdam in May. Indeed the final stage of The Next Star for Eurovision took place tonight. The delegation will attend remotely.
While the news may seem alarming, Dutch Eurovision organisers monitor the situation daily and these precautions are in line with advice from governments.

So what will host country The Netherlands do?
Well look no further than the official tariff card — which shows how much advertising costs at a specific time and during a specific programme. The provisional NPO broadcasting schedule shows that Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS will fill its Eurovision slots with its own programming, except from the Saturday grand final slot.
For the most part, AVROTROS seems to have decided to stick with their normal broadcasting schedule as if Eurovision were not to take place. But there are a few exceptions. It will start its Eurovision programming on Sunday 9 May with the broadcast of Eurovision 1975, which was the last contest the Netherlands won before 2019.
In het programmaschema van NPO1 zien we in mei:
* Za 9/5 NPO1, 14.03u ‘Eurovisie Songfestival 1975’
* Di 12/5 NPO1, 21.30u Docu van Cornald Maas ‘Op weg naar de winst’

AVROTROS Eurovision week programming
Tuesday 12 May: De weg naar de winst (21:30-23:30 CEST)
Eurovision commentator and Eurovision 2020 Creative Advisor Cornald Maas wrote and shot a documentary about the Netherlands’ road to success at Eurovision. De weg naar de winst (The Road to Victory) explores why it took the country over forty years to win the song contest again. The documentary was originally scheduled for a different date and time, but has now been given a prime time slot.

Thursday 14 May: Normal AVROTROS programming
On the night of what would have been the second Eurovision semi-final, fans of the contest will not be able to see shows related to Eurovision. Instead, AVROTROS will broadcast its typical Thursday programmes, including DNA Onbekend and Nick, Simon & Kees: Homeward Bound.
Saturday 16 May: De Beste Zangers Eurovision special (20:30-21:30 CEST)
From 20:30 until 21:30 local time, AVROTROS will broadcast its own programming. They plan to re-broadcast their 2019 Eurovision special of De Beste Zangers — the popular show where Dutch singers perform other people’s songs. You’ll see Glennis Grace cover Loreen’s “Euphoria” and Jan Smit and OG3NE will tackle ABBA’s “Waterloo.”
After this broadcast, the remaining time will be filled by the BNNVARA comedy programme Even Tot Hier.
Elsewhere in Europe
While Germany’s broadcaster ARD hinted at the EBU preparing special broadcasts to take place when Eurovision should have happened, several European broadcasters have decided to come up with their own programming.
The BBC has revealed that it will air a special show honouring both Eurovision classics as well as this year’s entries.

However, many broadcasters are producing digital Eurovision documentaries and mini-concerts to keep fans going over the next few months. This includes Finland’s Yle, who are set to premiere Eurovision Diaries on Monday, April 6.
Yle premieres Eurovision Diaries
The documentary takes a look back at the build up to Eurovision 2019, but puts the spotlight on the fans from across the world. It will be based solely on video material recorded by Eurovision fans, giving people the chance to see the world through the eyes of Eurovision devotees and the love they have for the contest.
It will no doubt show some very emotional moments – tears of joy after someone’s favourite act takes home the trophy, or a heartbreak if the final vote did not go as a fan was hoping it would.
Eurovision Diaries – Trailer
The footage for Eurovision Diaries was collected between January and late autumn in 2019. It includes videos from over one hundred people from all over the world – Mexico, Argentina, the Philippines, Australia…and, of course, Europe.
You will also see some familiar faces in the documentary, including Finland’s Eurovision 2019 star Darude as well as last year’s winner Duncan Laurence. Even Serhat will make an appearance to help cheer you up!
Meanwhile, Finnish Eurovision 2013 act and regular UMK host Krista Siegrids has been busy recording some voice overs for the documentary to help guide us through the programme.
Eurovision Diaries even has its own theme song, written especially for the documentary. Titled “Love Is My Favourite Song”, the track is performed by Sonja Lumme.
Lumme represented Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest back in 1985. She took ninth place at the contest in Gothenburg with her song “Eläköön elämä” (“Long live life”).
“Love Is My Favourite Song” serves old-school schlager vibes and has a focus on spreading love and joy. It could easily have been a Eurovision entry from yesteryear.
Sonja Lumme (feat. Eurovision Fans) – “Love Is My Favourite Song”
The music video for “Love Is My Favourite Song” mixes clips of Sonja recording the track in the studio with some of the fan videos we can expect to see in the documentary. Can you spot yourself there?
Eurovision diaries will be available on Yle Areena this Monday 6 April. It will be available in English, so everyone is welcome to watch.
Yle to rebroadcast Eurovision 2006, 2007 and 2014
Eurovision Diaries isn’t the only thing Yle have in store for Finnish Eurovision fans this season. Earlier this week, the broadcaster announced that they’ll be rebroadcasting Eurovision 2014, 2006 and 2007 between 14-16 May.
In 2006, Finland secured their first (and so far only) Eurovision win, after monster band Lordi rocked the whole of Europe to its core with “Hard Rock Hallelujah”. The 2007 contest was subsequently held in Helsinki.
Eurovision 2014 saw Finland achieve their best result of the 2010s. Softengine took the pop-rock song “Something Better” to the contest in Copenhagen and finished in eleventh place.
Yle will also be showing the EBU’s alternative programme Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, which will replace the grand final of Eurovision 2020 on 16 May.
Like their neighbours Sweden, Yle is also giving Finnish fans a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision 2020 songs. The top ten will then be revealed in Viisukevät 2020: Top 10 on Thursday 14 May.
Eurovision 2020 may not be going ahead, but Finnish fans still have a lot to look forward to!

What do we know about “Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light?”
The EBU intends for the two-hour long show to honour the 41 selected songs for Eurovision 2020 in a non-competitive format.
Organisers have revealed that the show will close with a special performance of “Love Shine A Light” — Katrina & The Waves’ Eurovision 1997 winning song for the UK.
The 41 Eurovision 2020 acts will jointly perform the past Eurovision hit, each from their own location. “Love Shine A Light” was chosen for its unifying lyrics that are appropriate for the current situation across the continent.
The EBU wants to bring Eurovision fans from all over the world together. During the show, fans will virtually sing along on Johnny Logan’s iconic “What’s Another Year.”
It will be hosted by Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley (Eurovision 1998 and 2007) and Jan Smit, who were originally set to be the hosts of Eurovision 2020.
It won’t just be the 2020 acts that make an appearance. Former Eurovision stars from recent contests will also be invited to take part and perform iconic Eurovision songs.
Dutch make-up artist and YouTuber NikkieTutorials will also create online content leading up to this alternate programme. The online media mogul was originally appointed to do this in the run-up to Eurovision 2020.
More details about Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light will be revealed in due course.

The results were revealed during the broadcaster’s alternative Eurovision special Pesem Evrovizije: Najboljših 25 (Eurovision Song Contest: The Best 25).
Maja Keuc’s “No One” is Slovenia’s favourite Eurovision entry
Maja — now known as Amaya — took Slovenia to 13th position on the scoreboard, scoring 96 points. “No One” did even better in the semi-finals, when it came third. The entry also broke a three year non-qualifiying streak for the country.
On her win, Amaya says:
“We all know that it was a party and not a serious competition. Anyway, thank you for all your votes, it means a lot to me, especially at this time. Thanks also to my team that stood for me and with whom we created this song. I love you and thank you again for a brighter day. “
In second place is the 2002 act Sestre with “Samo ljubezen”. They also placed 13th in the final.
While the drag trio have gone down in history as one of Slovenia’s most iconic entries, their initial selection proved to be very controversial.
A BBC report from the time details homophobic protests and parliamentary debates both at home and in Europe.
Thankfully, attitudes appear to have changed for the better in the intervening 18 years.
In third place, is another recent act — 2015’s Maraaya with “Here For You”. The husband-wife duo opened the grand final in Vienna and ultimately came 14th.
They’ve remained close to the Eurovision scene in Slovenia, working with both the Junior Eurovision 2014 and 2015 acts and national finalists such as BQL.
Slovenia’s Top 25 Eurovision Entries
The full rankings are listed below. They are based on an online vote held between 27 April and 2 May. A total of 30,793 votes were cast.

Cerveny et al. 2017: WMO Assessment of Weather and Climate Mortality Extremes: Lightning, Tropical Cyclones, Tornadoes, and Hail, Climate Weather and Society,
Discussion
The Bangladesh (at time of incident, East Pakistan) Cyclone of 12-13 November, 1970. This notorious tropical cyclone is sometimes referred to as the ‘Great Bhola Cyclone’ with an estimated 300,000 (low end) to 500,000 (high end) storm-related fatalities (mostly the result of a large storm surge overwhelming the islands and tidal flats along the shores of the Bay of Bengal). Frank and Husain (1971) note that the origin of the Great Bhola Cyclone can be traced back to the remnant of a tropical storm that moved westward across the Malayan Peninsula on 5 November. This system spawned a depression over the south central Bay of Bengal on 8 November 1970. That depression strengthened and likely attained storm intensity on 9 November, while continuing to drift very slowly northward. An estimated maximum wind of 100 kt (51.4 ms-1) in the November 1970 cyclone corresponded to a central pressure between 950 and 960 hPa. Two major concerns were raised by the committee in the investigation of this proposed extreme. First, do the official records match the high range in death tolls (300,000 to 500,000) for this incident? Second, are there other tropical cyclones that could potentially have had a higher death toll? As with any disaster of this magnitude, exaggerated death tolls are frequently common and official values difficult to obtain (Paul 2011). For example, online sources and published sources often differ significantly in numbers associated with specific disasters (e.g., Terry et al. 2012). One of the first professional articles addressing the death toll of this 1970 tropical cyclone was by Frank and Husain (1971). They explicitly state, “On 12 November 1970, a severe tropical cyclone of moderate strength riding the crest of high tide lashed East Pakistan with a 20-ft storm surge and killed approximately 300,000 people. The official figures show 200,000 confirmed burials and another 50,000 to 100,000 missing.” Similarly, Sommer and Mosely (1972) state based on the two site surveys that the mean mortality was “16.5%, representing a minimum of 224,000 deaths.”
A recent official WMO source (WMO, 2012) also cites that mortality value of 300,000 as an official death toll. During the course of the investigation, members of the WMO evaluation committee have also uncovered many recent professional documents citing the 300,000 mortality values. For example, Ali (1979), Murthy (1984), Murthy et al. (1986), Dube et al. (2008) and Nott et al. (2014) consistently cite a mortality value of 300,000. However, less regulated sites such as Wikipedia consistently state 500,000 people dead. Unfortunately, these sites claiming a 500,000 death toll list as source weblinks which are dead or inactive or, as one committee member noted, “part of the ‘grey’ literature.” Consequently, given the consistency in the reviewed professional literature (particularly articles dating to times just after the catastrophe), the committee recommended acceptance of the estimated 300,000 value as best available estimate of the Great Bhola Cyclone mortality. However, the question remains as to whether other cyclones might have produced equal or larger death tolls. For example, in their review of the Great Bhola Cyclone, Frank and Husain (1971) directly state in the text that the “Bakerganj” cyclone in 1876 killed between 100,000 and 400,000 people. However, as one committee member noted, they listed only the lower estimate in their own table (Table 1 of Frank and Husain, 1971) by declaring a value of only 100,000 dead for the Bakerganj cyclone. Other claimants such as the potential 300,000 deaths in the typhoon of 1923 for Japan have difficulties in that many of those deaths were likely caused by the Great Kanto (Tokyo) Earthquake which occurred almost at the same time when the typhoon hit Japan. Similarly, although on-line sources cite the death toll due to the Haiphong Typhoon in Vietnam in 1881 as up to 300,000, a recent study by Terry et al. (2012) reported that this horrendous figure does not match with the population in Haiphong at the time and probably contains an error which mixes up the number of death and the cost of damages. Another contender which is also commonly mentioned in online sources is the Super Typhoon Nina in China in 1975. The torrential rain of the storm that caused the collapse of the Banqiao Dam, resulting in severe flooding in Henan province, China. While some online sources suggest the death toll of the event may have reached up to 230,000, more professional sources state that the flooding killed 26,000 people and another 100,000 died of subsequent disease and famine (Yang et al. 2016). Even fairly recent tropical cyclone mortality values are quite variable. Committee members identified mortality values for Cyclone Nargis in 2008 varying from “more than 100,000” (Webster 2008) to 146,000 people with a commonly quoted range of 130,000 to 140,000. However, those death toll of Cyclone Nargis is unlikely to affect the consensus on the Great Bhola Cyclone event with an estimated death toll of 300,000 people. Finally, there were some discussions among committee members regarding the uncertainty in the primary cause and mortality figure of the Great Bengal Cyclone of 1737 (e.g., Bilham 1994; Chakrabarti 2013). While some sources list that cyclone as having a death toll comparable to the Great Bhola Cyclone of 1970, committee members with particular expertise in tropical cyclones noted that death counts from large killer cyclones in historical times, particularly before modern records, are highly uncertain. This corresponds to the recommendation that only values after 1873 be accepted into the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes""" ;

Benjamin Glenn Hoffmann, 46, is facing a series of charges, including four counts of murder, after the shooting in Darwin city last year.
In the Supreme Court this morning, Mr Hoffmann's lawyer Jon Tippett QC was asked by Chief Justice Michael Grant if his client would "run the defence of mental impairment" and Mr Tippett replied: "Yes, Your Honour."
In previous court hearings, Mr Hoffmann's legal representatives have indicated he will plead not guilty.
The court also heard today that Mr Hoffmann has been approved for legal aid to fund his defence.
Mr Tippett indicated that additional "special" funding would likely be required, due to the magnitude of the case.
The trial will likely take place at the end of this year or beginning of 2021.
The court heard the prosecution case includes up to 480 potential witnesses and the trial, dates for which are yet to be set, could run for up to 12 weeks.
Crown Prosecutor Tami Grealy told the court the duration of the trial would depend on the volume of evidence.
"It will depend, in part, on how much evidence is going to need to be called in relation to the issue of mental impairment, how many psychiatrists and psychologists will need to be called," she said.
Mr Hoffmann appeared via a video link from Darwin's Holtze Prison and did not speak during the hearing.

An Albuquerque cannabis dispensary employee has been charged in federal court with making internet threats to kill Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham after she announced the closing of all schools and a ban on large public gatherings because of the threat posed by the coronavirus.
Daniel Logan Mock, 33, had his initial appearance in federal court Wednesday on two counts of interstate communication of threats.
According to a criminal complaint filed by FBI agents, New Mexico State Police notified them of threats posted on a Facebook page operated by Lujan Grisham’s office.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
................................................................
“Time to pick up your rifles and kill this governor so we can re-establish the constitution as law of New Mexico. I’m done with corrupt government. They will serve the people or die,” was one comment the FBI said Mock posted on the governor’s Facebook page on March 13.
According to the complaint, Mock also posted another comment the same day threatening to “kill all police and government officials who are in violation of the constitution. All officers who respond will be executed for Tyranny. So ask yourself is violating my rights worth your life? Cause I have no fear of killing bad men and dying for the people.”
Earlier in the month, Mock posted a comment on the governor’s Facebook page that said, “There is never going to be a case. Focus your energy on more important things like tickets for the police who violated traffic and parking laws. That is why we are going to execute you.”
According to the complaint, the FBI spent days tracking down the ownership of the account holder, the phone on which the threats were made and where they were made from.
They finally located Mock at a Downtown Albuquerque medical cannabis shop where he worked. State Police officers contacted Mock’s girlfriend, who told them Mock had posted the comments on the governor’s Facebook account but that he was only “blowing off steam.”
The complaint states that Mock had tried to buy firearms in 2014 and 2016 but was denied by licensed firearms dealers.
In June 2019, the FBI received information about Mock when he posted on Oath Keepers Facebook page praising Brian Isaack Clyde, 22, who was shot and killed by law enforcement after Clyde opened fire at the federal courthouse in Dallas, Texas.
Clyde was the only person to die in that shooting. Mock called him a “hero” in his Facebook post and called on more people to attack government targets.""" ;

The March 23 raid by suspected hunters from the Dogon community on Ogossagou, a village in central Mali populated by rival Fulani herders, was part of a wider surge in ethnic and jihadist violence across Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger.
Prosecution for violent acts related to conflict in the Sahel is rare, and widespread impunity is among the reasons communities take it upon themselves to exact revenge in tit-for-tat killings.
â€œAmong the wounded taken care of by the medical service, five were formally recognized by others who had been wounded as being among the assailants,â€? Aza Ould Mohamed Nazim, a prosecutor in the Mopti region, told Reuters.

It came, the group said, in response to Turkish army operations in Kurdish parts of southeast Anatolia, part of a security clampdown on militant groups that has been criticised for its sweeping measures against Kurds.
The Ankara bombing took place in a busy transport hub in a diplomatic and government district.
The TAK rapidly came under suspicion for the attack which bore the hallmarks of another suicide bombing in Ankara on 17 February which killed 29 people.
The group formed a decade ago following a split in the ranks of the PKK, a Kurdish separatist rebel movement founded by Abdullah Ocalan, now serving a life jail term.
Whereas PKK attacks essentially target security forces and symbols of the Turkish state, the TAK have hit civilians with attacks on major cities and tourist sites.
Attacks by both groups were scaled down as peace talks got underway between the government and the PKK in 2012, until a mortar attack on Istanbul's Sabiha airport on 23 December left one person dead.
The TAK's relationship with the PKK is still unclear, and the larger militant group claim to have no links to the offshoot.
However, many analysts suggest that the TAK could be a front for the PKK to launch attacks on civilians and deny complicity.
For its part, the PKK has distanced itself from a 2011 "reprehensible" attack in Ankara which killed three, saying it "harmed the legitimate demands of the Kurdish people".
The debate on whether the two groups are linked continues in the country.""" ;

<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/12/changing-population-turns-georgia-into-trump-biden-battleground> dct:description """Republicans have dominated Georgia presidential elections for a generation, but Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 bid for the White House has made this Southern GOP stronghold competitive for the first time in nearly 30 years.
While Republican Donald Trump glided to victory in Georgia four years ago, support for Biden has rapidly increased in the weeks before Election Day. The Real Clear Politics polling average shows the candidates statistically tied in the state, and a Quinnipiac University Poll of likely Georgia voters conducted in late September, prior to the president’s COVID-19 diagnosis, found Biden leading Trump by three percentage points, just outside the survey’s margin of error. In the poll, 50 percent of voters said they would support Biden and 47 percent voiced an intention to vote for Trump.
That should set off alarm bells in the Trump campaign, which carried Georgia by a safe five percentage points against Hillary Clinton in 2016.
“I think Trump should be wary of what might happen in Georgia,” said Trey Hood, director of the University of Georgia’s Survey Research Center, which conducted a poll for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in late September showing the race at a dead heat.

[File: Dustin Chambers/Reuters] A Biden victory in Georgia would complicate Trump’s already narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, cutting the president off from votes that past Republicans have been able to secure without investing substantial campaign resources. Georgia is part of America’s deep South, which has voted Republican in recent years. But as the South changes, the Republican grip on the region could be loosening.
Changing demographics
Biden’s rise in the state is likely a result of changing demographics, particularly within Atlanta – Georgia’s largest city – which has undergone a population boom in recent years. The percentage of the state’s older white population has been on a steady decline, and has been replaced by a younger populace with fewer white residents who are increasingly voting Democratic. Many of those new voters are transplants from other states who have moved to Atlanta in recent years.

Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. “Wherever you look, you see Democrats rebounding. They haven’t reached majority status yet, but the numbers are moving in that direction.”
The tightest combat will occur in towns surrounding the Atlanta metropolitan area, a massive region that sprawls for nearly 22,000 square kilometres (8494 quake miles) and is home to more than 6 million people. The area has more than earned its nickname: “The Capital of the South.”
“Atlanta dominates other urban areas. It’s just huge. The real battle is in the ring of suburban counties around Atlanta,” said Hood. “It’s a turnout battle. There are very few people left to persuade. It’s who can get their forces to the polls.”
Georgia’s new battleground status has spurned both campaigns – and their allies – to action.
Prior to his COVID-19 diagnosis, Trump visited Georgia multiple times to campaign, as has his running mate, Mike Pence. The campaign has paid for television ads to air in the state throughout the month of September. They have had help from Super PACs like America First Action, a pro-Trump group, which plans to spend $2.8m to run a televised ad attacking Biden as “weak,” starting in October.
Focus on Black voters
Biden in September unveiled a multi-million advertisement campaign particularly aimed at increasing turnout of Black voters. The advertisement touts his running mate, Kamala Harris, whose father was a Black immigrant from Jamaica.
Both campaigns have also made ambitious efforts to woo Black voters in Georgia, who comprise more than 30 percent of the state’s population.
In 2019, Trump launched a “Black Voices for Trump” initiative with a speech in Atlanta. In September, he returned to Atlanta to announce what he calls a “Platinum Plan” for Black Americans, which includes proposals to support Black-owned businesses, to label the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist group and to recognize Juneteenth – a day that celebrates when the last Black slaves learned of their emancipation – as a national holiday. At the Republican National Convention in August, the party featured two Black policymakers from Georgia to make the case for the president.
President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, September 25, 2020 [Evan Vucci/AP Photo] Despite these efforts, recent polling suggests Biden will dominate among Black voters.
“I’m not seeing any movements in terms of African American voters toward Trump,” said Hood.
Biden has been relying on Black surrogates like Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018. Her advocacy group, Fair Fight Georgia, has registered hundreds of thousands of voters. A vast majority of Black voters will likely support Biden in 2020, but his level of success will hinge on their levels of turnout, something Clinton failed to produce four years earlier. The number of Black people who voted in 2016 was far less than in 2012, when Barack Obama won re-election.
“In Georgia, and in the Deep South in general, the heart and soul of the Democratic Party coalition is Black voters,” said J. Miles Coleman, an election analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “If the Democrats want the Black vote, it’s good to get a big vote out of Atlanta, but Democrats also have to pay attention to other areas of the state as well. If Biden can get the type of Black turnout in the rural areas that Obama was able to get, that would help in a very close race.”
Democrats have been emboldened by rising numbers of support in recent non-presidential elections, which could point to a blue future for this long-red state. In 2018, Democrats flipped several state House and Senate seats that had long been held by Republicans. During Abrams’s 2018 bid for governor, she came within 55,000 votes of carrying Georgia, closer than any Democrat in years. And this year, Georgia has two Senate seats up for re-election – the only state to do so this election cycle – which could further increase turnout at the ballot box.
“If Biden wins Georgia–or if he’s even within a few points – he’s probably already over 270 Electoral votes,” said Coleman. “For Biden, winning Georgia would almost be like the icing on the cake.”""" ;

<https://www.amazon.com/William-Clarke-Quantrill-Life-Times/dp/0806130814/> dct:description """William Clarke Quantrill entered the ranks of the infamous for sure on August 21, 1863, when he led a band of 450 men into Lawrence, Kansas, and committed what is probably the worst atrocity of the Civil War: the killing of 150 inhabitants and the burning of the town. Other massacres perpetrated by Quantrill occurred, but none was as devastating as what happened in Lawrence. To the Union he was an outlaw, and a price was put on his head. He was feared and hated during his day, and his reputation long outlived him (Castell believes he's one of the most widely known men connected with the Civil War).
He was born in Ohio in 1837, taught school for a while, and then went out west where he was a professional gambler around Salt Lake City. When the war broke out he was living in Kansas, and already had the notoriety of a desperado. His sympathies were with the South, and in 1861 formed a guerrilla band that attacked and destroyed Union property and murdered Union sympathizers in the border states. He helped the Confederates capture Independence, MO, and after the Lawrence atrocity, defeated Union forces at Baxter Springs, KS. His band by this time had become so unruly that not even Quantrill could reign them in, and it split into smaller factions. He was wounded in an ambush in Kentucky in May 1865 (rumor had it, though impossible to prove, that Quantrill at the time was heading for Washington to assassinate Lincoln) and died in a Union prison hospital on June 6, 1865. Whether anyone collected the reward money history doesn't say.
Castel's biography is popular in nature, though backed up with solid scholarship. Invented dialogue is sprinkled throughout the text, but it is not obtrusive and doesn't lower the book's high standards. Castel also recounts some of the legends that cropped up soon after Quantrill's death, some of them having to do with Quantrill's grave sight (desecrated) and his skull.
To some in the South he was a the bravest of the brave, while to most in the North he was a degenerate monster. Castel thinks he was courageous and a strong leader, but also cruel and without scruples. Every year until 1929 there was a Quantrill's Raiders reunion held near Blue Springs, KS. One legacy that evolved from Quantrill's band was that of Jesse and Frank James and the Dalton gang, all who got their start with Quantrill's Raiders. Castel tells the story of this nefarious man with skill and keeps our interest throughout.""" ;

<https://www.axs.com/the-history-of-electric-daisy-carnival-57026> dct:description """Long before the fireworks, Ferris wheels, and a colossal, animatronic owl came to symbolize it; Electric Daisy Carnival was nothing more than a warehouse party.
The only way of knowing when and where raves were going down depended on hand-outs and automated message. Showing up too early caused some people to question the address. Then again, arriving late wasn’t such a bad idea given how frequently the unauthorized gatherings were broken up.
DJ Steve ‘Kool-Aid’ ran an underground promotion company that specialized in putting together these legendary parties, one which became EDC and did so sporadically throughout the early to mid-90s. In 1997, Insomniac co-founder Pasquale Rotella picked up where DJ Steve left off by restructuring the electronic dance music scene to reach a broader audience.
Under Rotella, EDC went from an ill-equipped underground rave to a multi-million dollar experience that transcends the music.
EDC as it stands first took place at the Shrine Hall Expo in Los Angeles where over 5,000 ravers danced the night away. The festival would jump from place to place over the next few years, setting up shop in Austin, Texas twice and San Bernardino four years in a row, before ultimately returned to the City of Angels from 2007 to 2010.
Soon, EDC’s were set up in Colorado, New York, Illinois, and Puerto Rico, solidifying its status as the “American Ibiza.” Ravers, or “headliners” as Rotella dubbed them, trekked west in hopes of seeing EDC staples like Above & Beyond, Paul Van Dyk, and Kaskade.
The 2010 show at Los Angeles’ Memorial Coliseum overwhelmed organizers to the point that the city implemented provisions requiring attendees to be at least 18 years of age. The death of a 15-year-old girl placed a black cloud over the EDM scene.
Outside observers saw EDM music as nothing as a reason to use drugs. Los Angeles saw it the same way and pushed Rotella to move EDC out of Southern California.
“Without an executed contract in place at this time, it has become impossible to guarantee to all of the fans and talent that EDC can be produced at this venue this year,” Rotella said in 2011. “We are grateful for all of the events we’ve been able to produce at the Coliseum and Sports Arena over the years, and for the support of the fans, Los Angeles, the Coliseum Commission and everyone who has contributed to those events.”
EDC has grown from a single Saturday to encompass three full days. The Las Vegas Motor Speedway continuously tests the limits on its capacity, breaking attendance records year after year, including a record 700,000 in 2014. The 2015 event sold out within weeks despite not knowing who would perform.
For headliners, going to EDC isn’t about the price, location, or even which DJs fill the lineup. EDC is about peace, love, unity, and respect. Come June 19, they’ll again thank Rotella for keeping the concept alive.""" ;

<https://www.axs.com/the-ultra-music-festival-transportation-guide-45219> dct:description """The Ultra Music Festival is one of the largest DJ and EDM festivals in the world, and as such, thousands of music lovers flock to the Magic City every March to soak up all of the numerous sets that will take place over the final weekend of the month. The first order of business once you land in Miami is to find out how you are going to get around this vast metropolis, and fortunately for you, here are is a comprehensive guide to getting around Miami during Ultra.
Getting Around by Car
If you are coming in from out of town, more than likely, you will be passing through Miami International Airport, the busiest airport in Florida. Getting your own wheels is the best bet to really get around town, and like other metropolitan areas in the state, renting a car here is surprisingly cheap thanks to the sheer number of tourist who flocks here on a yearly basis.
To get to downtown Miami from the airport, take the main airport road and merge to the left onto State Road 953. SR 953 will take you to State Road 836, also known as the Dolphin Expressway, which is tolled, so have your coins ready. Merge onto the Dolphin Expressway heading east towards downtown Miami, and take it all the way to Interstate 95, where you will then head south. I-95 will provide access to downtown and all the downtown hotels near Bayfront Park.
Keep in mind that you’re in Miami, one of the most congested cities in the country; so if you choose to have your own wheels, be advised that you will spend A LOT of time in traffic, so patience is key.
By Public Transportation
Public Transportation is vary varied in Miami, as you will have your choice of bus, Metrorail or the downtown Metromover to get around; so doing Ultra by public transportation is not as bad as a lot of people will lead you to believe. Public transit in the county is provided by Miami-Dade Transit, which has routes all over the county.
To get from the airport to downtown, take the airport shuttle to the Miami Central Station just across SR 953 from the airport. From there, take the Metrorail Orange Line to the Earlington Heights Station, where you will then transfer to the Metro Green Line heading south towards downtown Miami.
Once Downtown, you can use the downtown Metromover to get from your hotel (if you’re staying downtown) to Bayfront Park via the Bayfront Park Metromover station. If you’re not staying in central Miami, you have to use the bus, and if you’re staying on Biscyane Boulevard during the festival, the Route 3 bus is your best bet to get to and from downtown.
Route 3 runs the entire length of Biscayne from downtown all the way to the Miami-Dade/Broward County line, and being one of the most heavily used routes in the system, the frequency on this line is fantastic.
By Taxi
If you are staying downtown or in central Miami, you really won’t need a taxi because public transit is plentiful and good; but if you are staying at a hotel in the suburbs, you may need to invest in a taxi, and be warned, taxis here are expensive! Here are the best ones in the county:
Yellow Cab/USA Taxi
Phone: 305-666-6668 or 786-505-2505
South Beach Taxi
Phone: 305-595-7522""" ;

Most of the simple tickets for the festival have now gone, but many coach and rail packages still remain.
Jay-Z
Several people have blamed the controversial choice of Jay-Z as the main headliner, while others blame the festivals growing size and consecutive years of bad weather.
Many fans who travelled by coach last year were also left stranded for hours at the event, following problems with the return transport, which could explain the slow sales of the coach packages.
Organisers
However, organisers this year promise there are systems in place which mean there will be no repeat of last year's problems.
They are also keen to stress the reduced environmental impact of coming to the festival by public transport.
But co-founder of the Big Chill Festival, Katrina Larkin, thinks the main reason for the slower take up this year is the festival's size.
She said: “The problem with Glastonbury – it’s got so big that when the rain comes they really just can’t look after everybody the same way a medium sized festival such as ourselves and a few others do.”

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/a1b7c602-5c9b-3bc1-ba13-fd64dc068ffc> dct:description """It hasn't always been like that and, even now, in many parts of Wales the "winter eisteddfod" is still an important part of the cultural year.
These days we are used to our main or major eisteddfodau being held in the summer months - the Urdd in the week of the Whitsun holiday, the International at Llangollen in the first week of July and the National Eisteddfod in the first week of August.
The very first eisteddfod took place over the Christmas period of 1176.
The three main events remain very much a part of the summer programme of festivities. It is interesting to note, therefore, that the very first eisteddfod actually took place not in the summer, but over the Christmas period of 1176.
The term "eisteddfod" was not used for this first event and did not achieve common parlance until the 15th century. When this first cultural gathering was called it was known simply as a bardic tournament.
Following the victory of Duke William - William the Conqueror as he became known - at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 there took place a piecemeal division of England.
The great lords and warriors who had been persuaded to help William in his campaign greedily accepted their payment or prizes - prizes that invariably meant huge parcels of land previously owned by the Saxon Earls.
Wales, however, was left untroubled for some time. It was a wild and ferocious country where for many years, both before and after the Normans began their incursions, the king's writ truly "did not run."
Only in the late 11th century, when the great Marcher Lords of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford finally felt strong and powerful enough, were the first attacks made across Offa's Dyke.
The next 200 or so years saw a period of intense warfare and bloodshed as the Norman barons and the Welsh princes clashed in battle after battle, campaign after campaign.
It was a see-saw period with first one side then the other gaining the upper hand.
However, by 1155 Rhys ap Gruffydd had, through military strength and cunning, managed to bring all of Deheubarth - the western parts of Wales - under his control.
It had been a long and powerful struggle and Rhys had been forced to submit to the power of Henry II, the English king, on no fewer than four occasions.
Such was the Welsh determination, however, that no sooner had Henry withdrawn his troops, thinking that the war had finished, Rhys rebelled and rose up in defiance once again. Henry was finally forced to come to terms with Rhys, formally granting him the title Lord of Ystrad Tywi. He has been known as the Lord Rhys ever since.
There were to be further campaigns and battles in the years ahead but, for now, the Lord Rhys felt sufficiently secure to turn his mind to matters other than warfare.
What Rhys wanted was to organise and run a cultural event that would underline his position as the most important Welsh chieftain in the country.
He had seen and enjoyed many aspects of Norman culture or life style but knew also that he could not afford to alienate his native Welsh followers.
He was fond of music and poetry and, like most of the Welsh princes, patronised bards who, in return, wrote long odes or verses extolling the significance of the Lord Rhys.
What he now decided to do was to hold a bardic tournament over the Christmas period of 1176/77, a festival of music and poetry - for prizes - that would celebrate the arts and ensure the supreme position of the Lord Rhys as a far-sighted ruler and as a major supporter of artistic endeavour.
Such a gathering of poets, singers and musicians probably owed more to Norman than Welsh influences as, up to that point, there had not been any similar event in Wales. In France, however, they were a common occurrence.
It was a significant moment in Welsh history as all of the eisteddfodau since held in the country owe more than a little to this first event.
Perhaps even more important, however, was the statement Rhys was making by holding the tournament in Cardigan Castle rather than at Dinefwr, the traditional seat of rulers of Deheubarth.
Cardigan, recently restored, was a stone-built castle and both it and the surrounding Borough of Cardigan had been recently acquired from the invading Normans. Rhys was clearly showing his power and position to Normans and Welsh alike.
This first eisteddfod had many of the aspects of the modern event. The tournament was announced a year in advance and minstrels and bards from places as far-flung was Ireland and France were invited to come to Cardigan to compete.
Two bardic chairs were to be awarded to the victors in poetry and music. A bard from Gwynedd in North Wales won the poetry chair while the son of Eilon the Crythwr, from Rhys' own court, claimed the prize for music.
Now regarded as the first eisteddfod ever held in Wales, it does not take much imagination to conjure visions of the festivities, the singing and dancing, the feasting and flirting, that undoubtedly took place at Cardigan over that Christmas period in 1176.
Bardic tournaments continued to be held during the 15th and 16th centuries until the Acts of Union in the reign of Henry VIII saw eisteddfodau decline in importance. From that point on it became more important to look to London if you wanted financial and political favour and Welsh noblemen and the emerging middle classes turned their backs on Welsh culture.
Not until the Gorsedd of Bards held a special ceremony at the Ivy Bush Hotel in Carmarthen in 1819 did the eisteddfod once again become a significant factor in Welsh life. But, in one form or another, the eisteddfod survived and the Lord Rhys, by calling his first bardic tournament at Cardigan in 1176, had begun a tradition that continues in the present day.""" ;

Holyhead Breakwater (Photo: Al Preston)
In late October that year the weather had been unsettled, the skies grey and brooding. Old men working at their lobster pots or fishing nets would look up at the heavens and declare that there was bad weather on the way. Then, at around midday on 25 October it began to rain, first in Pembrokeshire and Ceridigion on the west coast of Wales.
In the middle of the afternoon there was a sudden increase in wind speed and structural damage began to be reported in the western counties of England.
By tea time the wind had gathered even more strength and soon wild waves were lashing at the beaches and cliffs of the Welsh coast. Out at sea, sailors quickly realised what was to come and began to run for shelter or, wherever possible, get into port. Even the pilot cutters of the Bristol Channel, well used to bad weather, headed for shelter.
Throughout the night of 25/26 October waves and wind battered with unrelenting fury against the coast. By midnight the storm had assumed near-hurricane proportions, wind speeds of well over 100 mph being reported.
Wales, along with Cornwall and Devon, took the brunt of the storm but few parts of Britain escaped unscathed. Nearly 150 ships were wrecked that night, most of them caught against an unforgiving coast, while dozens more were so severely damaged that their owners had little option other than to scrap them.
Well over 800 people died in the storm, 465 of them on the steamer Royal Charter which was driven onto the rocks at Point Lynas near Moelfre on the west coast of Ynys Môn. The ship was returning from Australia, many of the passengers being prospectors from the recently discovered gold fields in Australia.
Tragically, the Royal Charter was lost within sight and sound of rescuers on land. The villagers of Moelfre could do little more than watch as 60 foot waves pounded the ship to pieces before their eyes. There are stories of passengers leaping into the sea, their pockets full of gold and coins and, as a consequence, being dragged down by the weight of the wealth they had earned. Whether or not that is true, divers are still recovering artifacts from the wreck of the ship.
The enormity of the Royal Charter disaster has never gone away. Charles Dickens came to report on the incident and write about it in his book The Uncommercial Traveller while Stephen Hughes, the Rector of St Gallgo Church, wrote over 1,000 letters of sympathy and condolence to relatives of the drowned. In many circles, particularly in Wales, the storm is still known as the Royal Charter gale.
There were dozens of other shipwrecks that night. Included amongst them were the Bideford brig Susan, lost with all hands at Cardiff, and the schooner John St Baube, bound for Gloucester docks. The tiny trading ship went ashore at Lavernock Point, again with the loss of all hands.
At Pembroke Dockyard, the only Royal Naval yard to exist in Wales, the 50-gun Immortalite had been launched only that day and there were very real fears for the safety of what was, at that stage, little more than the shell of a ship. Extra lines were fixed and, to the relief of everyone, the ship swung easily at her moorings all night long. The town of Pembroke Dock was not so lucky, however, as three of the residents lost their lives in the gale.
Clearly, then, it was not just ships that suffered. There were dozens of casualties, injuries and deaths right across Wales. Many of these were caused by falling rocks and masonry as the wind surged inland. Houses were damaged, slates ripped off roofs as if they were just pieces of paper and nobody ventured outside unless it was vital.
Trees were uprooted and, in the minds and opinions of many, the topography of the coastal area drastically changed. It is alleged - although unproven - that the huge pebble bank at the back of Newgale beach in Pembrokeshire was created by the storm, when the pebbles and rocks were thrown up there during the course of the long and dreadful night.
As dawn broke on the morning of 26 October the storm began to abate and people were able to begin counting the cost - but only in some parts of the country. The wind did not reach maximum force on the River Mersey until midday on 26 October and by then many, if not most, of the deaths had already occurred.
In the wake of the storm Captain Robert Fitzroy of the Meteorological Office knew that something had to be done to prevent such a disaster happening again. In 1860 he duly brought in a gale warning service. It would not prevent storms and gales battering the Welsh coast but it did at least warn people to take shelter and, as sailors say, "batten down the hatches".""" ;

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/shangri_la_01.shtml> dct:description """Origins of Shangri-La The tale of an earthly paradise is among the most enduring myths in the world. From Sumerian epic to the 'islands of the blest' in Celtic literature, it has been a recurring theme through many bodies of literature and for thousands of years. Not surprisingly, then, modern people have also been drawn to the dream of a lost paradise where the ravages of time and history have been held back, where human beings live in harmony with nature, and where the wisdom of the planet is saved for future generations. In other words, to a Shangri-La. Lost Horizon was a tale for its times. The story of Shangri-La itself is a modern one, told by the English novelist James Hilton in his novel Lost Horizon (1933). Set in the troubled years before World War Two, the book tells of a community in a lamasery (a monastery for Tibetan lamas), in the lost Tibetan valley of Shangri-La, cut off from the world and from time. All the wisdom of the human race is contained in this place, in the cultural treasures stored, and in the minds of the people who have gathered here in the face of an imminent catastrophe. Hilton's tale struck a chord. The book enjoyed great popularity, and even the retreat of the US president at Camp David was called Shangri-La, after the paradise described in it. And when the novel was turned into a Hollywood movie by Frank Capra, it was an instant success. These days, the name is part of the language, used everywhere from Nepali airlines and Chinese hotel chains to holiday cottages in Florida and Torquay. Lost Horizon was a tale for its times. In the increasingly pessimistic 1930s, when Western civilisation seemed bent on a path to self-destruction - and when, as Carl Jung put it, 'the smell of burning was in the air' - the story of a kind of earthly paradise had an irresistible appeal. And Tibet in the 1930s was still a land of mystery, one of the last unmapped places, a forbidden and insular country. Nowadays, of course, the choice of the location of the tale seems all the more poignant, given what happened in Tibet some years after the book was published, with the Chinese invasion of 1949, and the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Top
Tale of 'Lost Horizon' In the novel, a group of Westerners is rescued by plane from war and chaos in Central Asia, only to crash-land in a remote valley surrounded by the highest mountains in the world. The location of the fictional lost valley is never precisely pinpointed, but on its last fateful flight the plane appears to be heading northeast from Afghanistan across the Karakorum mountains, part of the Himalayan range, and Hilton clearly imagined that it landed somewhere in the then unexplored far west of Tibet. It was a repository of all the cultural treasures of the planet, and its inhabitants were opposed to all violence and materialism. He tells us that in the valley there was a lamasery, headed by a 200-year-old Capuchin lama. It was a repository of all the cultural treasures of the planet, and its inhabitants were opposed to all violence and materialism. This lamasery stood in the shadow of a magnificent white mountain, 'the loveliest mountain on earth ... an almost perfect cone of snow, a dazzling pyramid so radiant, so serenely poised that it scarcely seemed to be real'. But on what older tale was this exotic story based? Did Hilton have an actual place in mind? Was there indeed a real Shangri-La? And why does the myth of an earthly paradise seem to have such a hold on the human imagination? Top
Andrade's tale The tale of a lost kingdom in the region of the Tibetan mountains first came to Western attention nearly four centuries ago. And like many a tale of hidden treasure, it starts with a mysterious map - this one lost, then rediscovered a hundred years ago in Calcutta. It was part of a remarkable manuscript that contained the autobiography of a 16th-century Western missionary at the court of the Moghul emperor Akbar. At Akbar's time India still reigned glorious at the centre of the civilised world, but the winds were changing and the great power of Asian lands was just beginning to reduce, under pressure from the modernity of Europe. In partial response to this shifting world, Akbar gathered scholars of all races around him, hoping to find the common basis of all religions, in order to remove the sources of religious conflict for the good of humankind. As he put it: It now becomes clear ... that it cannot be right to assert the truth of one faith above any other ... In this way we may perhaps again open the door whose key has been lost. Thus in his court congregated Hindus, Yogis and Sadhus from all corners of his empire, as well as visiting Christian monks and pilgrims from western lands. This was the moment when Westerners first heard accounts of what lay beyond the Himalayan mountains, the very first time that Tibet entered the consciousness of Europeans. One visiting Jesuit priest summarised the strange stories he heard at the court of Akbar in an essay, and sketched an accompanying map. On his map the area of Tibet is depicted as a great white blank, except for one place, labelled 'Manasarovar lacus' (Lake Manasarovar), with next to it a tantalising scribbled note saying, 'Here it is said Christians live'. The priest who penned the map was old, and incapable of undertaking a dangerous mission across high mountain passes in search of an obscure community of Christians. But his successor, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary named Antonio Andrade, was galvanised by the tale, and determined to go in search of these people. Andrade set out from Akbar's court, armed with the map, and at first followed yogis and wandering pilgrims on the road across the mountains. The terrain soon became hostile, but Andrade did eventually find an impressive and wealthy kingdom - although no Christians lived there - and his account of his adventurous journey was rediscovered in Calcutta in the 19th century. It was republished in 1926 under the title Discovery of Tibet, and Hilton's Lost Horizon obviously owes much to this work. Top
Shambala This idea of a lost kingdom somewhere in the Himalayas has also circulated in Tibetan Buddhist teaching for centuries, and may well itself have been told at the court of Akbar. The name Shambala first appears in a text known as the Kalachakra tantra - or Wheel of Time teaching. The Kalachakra doctrine belongs to the highest level of Buddhist Mahayana teaching, and those who follow it can reach enlightenment in just a number of years rather than a whole lifetime. In this doctrine, the place named Shambala appears as a mystical conception, a spiritual rather than a geographical goal. (Curiously, although the tale is known now as a Tibetan myth, it seems that it was first recorded in AD 966 in India.) The Buddhist Kalachakra tale tells of a land behind the Himalayas, ruled by a gracious King Sucandra, who was the first to learn the Kalachakra doctrine from Buddha Sakyamuni himself. In Shambala, the people lived in peace and harmony, faithful to the principles of Buddhism, and the concepts of war and sorrow were unknown. Shambala is a magic land, unlike any place on earth, and rests in the shadow of a magnificent white mountain. As one commentator on the Kalachakra tantra puts it: The land of Shambala lies in a valley. It is only approachable through a ring of snow peaks like the petals of a lotus ... At the centre is a nine-storey crystal mountain which stands over a sacred lake, and a palace adorned with lapis, coral, gems and pearls. Shambala is a kingdom where humanity's wisdom is spared from the destructions and corruptions of time and history, ready to save the world in its hour of need. The prophecy of Shambala states that each of its 32 kings will rule for 100 years. As their reigns pass, conditions in the outside world will deteriorate. Men will become obsessed with war and pursue power for its own sake and materialism will triumph over all spiritual life. Eventually an evil tyrant will emerge to oppress the earth in a despotic reign of terror. But just when the world seems on the brink of total downfall and destruction, the mists will lift to reveal the icy mountains of Shambala. Then the 32nd king of Shambala, Rudra Cakrin, will lead a mighty army against the tyrant and his supporters and in a last great battle, they will be destroyed and peace restored. Top
Shangri-La today As we have seen, the tale of Shangri-La is a modern tale, with a powerful appeal for today's world - but its roots lie deep in much older times. We live in a period when global problems threaten to overwhelm us, and instil us with fear. The appeal of the tales of Shambala and Shangri-La lies in their connection with this fear - both recognising it and alleviating it - and this appeal is universal. The stories reflect our desire that something of our world will survive, and that our connection with our past will not be entirely erased, even as we move faster and faster into an uncertain future. These are tales that we still need to believe in today. Top

Altamont was meant to be a repeat of Woodstock, a free spirited event and brought together all greatest 60s rock acts. Hells Angels were drafted in as security for the event. Unsurprisingly they soon lost control of the situation and a fight started in the middle of a heaving crowd.
In a desperate attempt to try and prevent the disaster, Mick Jagger can be heard on the film of the event saying "We're splitting man if those cats don't stop beating everybody up inside, I want them out of the way man". Tragically his efforts were in vain as a fan was stabbed to death in the heat of the moment.

US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
Gabby Giffords was a friend of mine. She is not only an extraordinary public servant, but she is also somebody who is warm and caring.
It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does - listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbours. That is the essence of what our democracy is all about. That is why this is more than a tragedy for those involved. It is a tragedy for Arizona and a tragedy for our entire country.
What Americans do at times of tragedy is to come together and support each other. So at this time I ask all Americans to join me and Michelle in keeping all the victims and their families, including Gabby, in our thoughts and prayers.
JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER
I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff. An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society.
Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured, and their families. This is a sad day for our country.
SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR
My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of today's tragic shooting in Arizona.
On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.
NANCY PELOSI, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER
This terrible act of violence is a national tragedy, and today is a very sad day for our country.
Congresswoman Giffords is a brilliant and courageous member of Congress, bringing to Washington the views of a new generation of national leaders. It is especially tragic that she was attacked as she was meeting with her constituents whom she serves with such dedication and distinction.
ERIC CANTOR, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER
I was deeply horrified to learn today of the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others in Tucson. Our thoughts and prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords and her family, her staff, and the residents of Tucson on this sad day.
As this serious situation continues to develop, I remain in close communication with Democratic leaders, the Speaker's office and the Sergeant at Arms. We will remain in constant communication regarding any schedule changes.
MITCH MCCONNELL, SENATE MINORITY LEADER
This senseless attack today in Tucson is a national tragedy, and all America mourns those who lost their lives in the very act of public service.
I join the entire Congress in condemning this horrifying act of violence, and on behalf of the entire Senate family, Elaine and I extend our deepest expressions of sympathy and heartfelt prayers to Rep Giffords and the families of those who have been killed or injured.
JOHN MCCAIN, ARIZONA SENATOR
I am horrified by the violent attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords and many other innocent people by a wicked person who has no sense of justice or compassion. I pray for Gabby and the other victims, and for the repose of the souls of the dead and comfort for their families. I beg our loving Creator to spare the lives of those who are still alive, heal them in body and spirit, and return them to their loved ones.
Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race, and they deserve and will receive the contempt of all decent people and the strongest punishment of the law.
ERIC HOLDER, US ATTORNEY GENERAL
Today's tragedy in Arizona was a senseless act of violence that has already resulted in devastating loss, including the death of Chief United States District Court Judge John Roll and four other individuals and the wounding of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and a number of others....
FBI Director Mueller is traveling to Arizona to help coordinate the investigation. The FBI is working jointly with local law enforcement to investigate today's events, and I have directed Department prosecutors and law enforcement officials to use every resource necessary to investigate this tragedy. I want to assure the people of Arizona and every American that we will hold accountable anyone responsible for these heinous acts.
JAN BREWER, ARIZONA GOVERNOR
I am just heartbroken. Gabby is more than just a colleague, she's actually a friend. She's always been a noble public servant.
AMY KREMER, CHAIRMAN OF TEA PARTY EXPRESS GROUP
These heinous crimes have no place in America and they are especially grievous when committed against our elected officials. Spirited debate is desirable in our country but it only should be the clash of ideas.
An attack on anyone for political purposes, if that was a factor in this shooting, is an attack on the democratic process. We join with everyone in vociferously condemning it.
DAVID CAMERON, UK PRIME MINISTER
Like everyone in Britain, I was shocked and saddened by the shootings which took place yesterday in Tucson, Arizona. Our hearts go out to all of those who have been caught up in this terrible incident.
That such an attack should have taken place against a member of Congress as she was meeting her constituents in a shopping centre on a Saturday morning is especially shocking to all of us who believe in democracy.
I am keeping Representative Giffords in my thoughts and prayers as she battles for life, together with all of those who have been wounded.""" ;

It is the first time in the festival's history that tickets have gone on sale eight months before the event.
Up until now, they have traditionally been sold from the beginning of April. In previous years, tickets were snapped up within two hours, however last year organisers were struggling to sell the final tickets even as the first campers rolled up to Worthy Farm.
Michael said afterwards that he was "so scared" and worried at the time, so much so that he lost half a stone in weight.
After resorting to selling day tickets, the event did eventually sell-out.
Exorbitant ebay
Tickets have, over the years, caused the organisers many headaches. In the 70s they struggled to sell them whereas in the late 80s and 90s many jumped the fence and got in for free.
This all changed in 2000 when the 'ring of steel' - a £1m security fence - was installed, stopping hundreds from attending illegally.
Glastonbury in 1971 (pic Mervyn Penrose) Since then, as the festival became more mainstream, Michael and Emily Eavis and co. have struggled to find a ticketing system which was fair.
The advent of the Internet pushed prices up as touts snapped up tickets and sold them on at exorbitant mark-ups - some tickets which were bought for £150 were being sold on ebay for £750; a far cry from the first Glastonbury in 1970 which cost £1 and included free milk.
The fact that ordinary fans were losing out irked the organisers so much that in 2004 they printed festival-goers' names on every ticket, meaning everyone was required to bring along two forms of identification.
This again was open to manipulation by the touts so in 2007 they turned to a registration system which involved the individuals' photos being printed onto the ticket so there could be no doubt that they had indeed purchased the ticket.
This system came into difficulty this year as, despite several hundred thousand people registering for tickets, only 100,000 of the 145,000 tickets sold out on the first day of sale, whereas their competitors Reading and Leeds (who did not have a registering system) sold out within hours.
Michael organises three events Many factors were blamed - everything from Michael Eavis controversially saying he wanted to attract a younger audience to the event to Jay-Z being the headliner.
"After three years, I am now confident that we have developed the fairest ticketing operation available anywhere, and we are ready to go," said Michael.
"With the new scheme, backed by the all-important registration process, everyone has an equal chance of getting a ticket. And most importantly, every ticket will be going to a genuine festival-goer direct.
"I’m also convinced that the £50 deposit will help a lot of people to spread the payment for their ticket over a much longer period."
As the festival has now sold out, it seems they have finally found the best system to ensure everyone has an equal chance to buy a ticket.""" ;

A Canadian man who killed worshippers in a Quebec City mosque in 2017 has been sentenced to life in prison.
Alexandre Bissonnette, 29, will be eligible for parole in 40 years.
The prosecution had asked for a total of 150 years behind bars, which would have been the harshest jail penalty ever handed down in Canada.
Justice Francois Huot chose instead to allow for the possibility of parole within Bissonnette's natural life.
While reading his sentencing decision, the Quebec Superior Court judge said that "punishment should not be vengeance".
A first-degree murder conviction in Canada carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, where the attack took place on January 29, 2017
On the evening of 29 January, 2017, Bissonnette stormed into the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre and shot at those gathered for prayers, killing six and seriously injuring five others, including Aymen Derbali, who is now paralysed.
In March, Bissonnette admitted to killing Khaled Belkacemi, 60, Azzedine Soufiane, 57, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, Aboubaker Thabti, 44, and Ibrahima Barry, 39, in the January attack.
He also pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, including one count for the 35 people who were present in the mosque at the time of the shooting but who were not injured.
"I am ashamed of what I did," he told a Quebec courtroom at the time. "I am not a terrorist, I am not an Islamophobe."
Justice Huot said Bissonnette's actions in entering the mosque at the end of prayers and shooting congregants was motivated by prejudice. But the judge also noted Bissonnette had mental health issues.
Lawyers for both the defence and the prosecution said they needed time to analyse the judge's lengthy decision amid the possibility of an appeal.
Mr Derbali told journalists at the Quebec City courthouse that many survivors were deeply disappointed with the judge's ruling.
He said the sentence did not fully reflect the severity of the crimes committed.
Video caption Aymen Derbali faces a new life after being paralysed in a 2017 Quebec mosque shooting
In 2011, Canadian law was amended to allow judges to impose consecutive sentences instead of concurrent 10- or 25-year sentences with no parole eligibility, for multiple murders.
Bissonnette's lawyers had argued that if he was sentenced to 25 years consecutively for each murder it would amount to death by incarceration.
Consecutive sentences have been applied a handful of times in Canada since the law was amended, including a judge handing down a 75-year prison sentence for a man who pleaded guilty to killing three police officers in 2014.""" ;

In the absence of this year's Eurovision Song Contest, cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, fans are reliving old competitions every Saturday night.
Eurovision Again - watched in sync at 8pm British time on YouTube - connects fans across Europe online and has been the top UK trend on Twitter every time it's been on.
"It brings a sense of togetherness and let's me be with all of my friends every Saturday," 20-year-old Nana-Ama Ewusi-Emmim tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
"It's something to look forward to."
Twitter says there have been 100,000 tweets about the fan organised watch-a-long, which trends higher than shows like Britain's Got Talent - broadcast at the same time on TV.
The most recent contest chosen was 1997, which was the last time the UK won with Katrina and The Waves - who also joined in with Eurovision Again online.
"I wasn't born in 1997," laughs Nana-Ama. "It was such a weird feeling to see what it's like for the UK to win."
The student social worker from London says "it's like a history lesson" each week and helps her stay connected with friends she's made through the song contest and distracts her from the news.
"I'm concentrated on something that makes me happy rather than something that makes me upset."
Around 200m viewers watch Eurovision each year and it's become a huge hit for younger audiences with nearly half of all under 24-year-olds in Europe - who were watching TV - seeing 2019's final.
Image copyright Nana-Ama Ewusi-Emmim Image caption Nana-Ama says it's a "lovely alternative" to the song contest - which was supposed to be held next month in The Netherlands after Dutch artist Duncan Laurence, pictured with Nana-Ama, won last year
The idea for Eurovision Again came from British fan Rob Holley, who just wanted to do something to celebrate the contest.
"It's heart warming that it's become this Saturday night institution in just five weeks," he says.
Rob - with three others - works on video clips, graphics and a voting mechanism for the show to see if the Twitter scoreboard is different to the original.
"There's a certain amount of justice we're able to dish out," he says.
"Fans have a lot to look forward to because we're going to keep this going as long as lockdown lasts."
Eurovision organisers support this fan initiative and are helping to get older contests on YouTube for it.
Rob asks viewers taking part to consider donating "the price of a pint or a good bottle of wine" - with more than £7,500 raised so far for charities including Stonewall, Mermaids and Terrence Higgins Trust.

The 65th Eurovision song contest was planned to take place in Rotterdam in May where 22-year-old Pim Steenbergen is from.
"I live for the contest," he tells Newsbeat. "This year would have been amazing as I was volunteering at the arena and had planned meet ups with international Eurovision fans."
The Rotterdam Ahoy arena has now been turned into a hospital to help The Netherlands cope with its Covid-19 outbreak.
"Eurovision Again is a distraction from all the bad stuff going on," Pim explains. "We can still have this moment with each other - even though it's not in real life."
Social restrictions mean Pim can't have friends over, so he's grateful for "some Eurovision experience" to tweet about with friends and he's understanding it more the second time around.
Contests re-watched by fans have so far included 2013, 2006, 2009, 2015 and 1997.
"I was eight in 2006 and now because I understand the English language so much more the lyrics have more meaning," Pim explains.

Inquests into the deaths of 30 Britons killed by a gunman on a Tunisian beach have been pushed back to next year.
The inquests were due in November this year but judge and coroner Nicholas Loraine-Smith said there was "an enormous amount of work to be done".
He told a pre-inquest hearing at London's Royal Courts of Justice he was "sorry" the date had been moved.
Seifeddine Rezgui killed 38 people in the attack in June 2015, with so-called Islamic State claiming responsibility.
The Britons were all holiday-makers staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, just north of Sousse.
Who were the British victims?
The court heard the Metropolitan Police had received 750,000 files from 40 computers and mobile phones seized by Tunisian investigators, while officers were preparing reports on each victim.
The coroner indicated the data could be reviewed for only relevant photo or documentary evidence.
He ruled the scope of the inquiry should assess security at the beach and nearby RIU Imperial Marhaba Hotel before and after the attack on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis in March 2015, in which 22 people died, including one Briton.
Suzanne Richards, from Wednesbury, in the West Midlands, lost her son Joel Richards, 19, father Pat Evans, 78, and brother Adrian Evans, 49, in the attack.
"Nothing can turn back the clock, but it is important to us to find out if any lessons can be learned to try to prevent similar heart-breaking devastation in future," she said.
Clive Garner, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represents the families of 16 victims, said there were "serious concerns" about "what appears to be an escalating threat of terrorist activity in Tunisia" before the attack.

At approximately 11:30 local time, gunman Seifeddine Rezgui pulled a Kalashnikov from a parasol he was carrying and opened fire on the beach outside the five-star Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba
He threw explosives at the pool area and then continued shooting inside the hotel reception
Rezgui was filmed running past the neighbouring Hotel Riu Bellevue and up a side alley, still armed with his gun and at least one other grenade
He was shot and killed by police in a nearby street at around 12:30
Thirty-eight people were killed in the attack including 30 Britons, three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and one Russian, with many more injured
The so-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack
Read more about what happened during the attack
A previous hearing heard the inquest will look at what, if anything, the UK government and travel companies knew about the risk of an attack at the Mediterranean resort.
The coroner will also consider the "adequacy" of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's travel advice for the region.
Another pre-inquest hearing is expected on 25 May and the full inquest from 16 January 2017.""" ;

WEST STOCKBRIDGE
The sky had turned a very odd shade of green. Barbara Tonini had never seen the sky that color.
And then the noise: Unbelievably loud.
"Like a freight train was coming through, only there were no tracks near us," she recalled.
But perhaps what frightened Barbara Tonini the most was what was happening to the telephone poles. The wind was bending them over. Slowly, inexorably.
"I couldn't believe they didn't just snap," she said.
The poles didn't snap. But Tonini, and her infant son, Christopher, were near the epicenter of what is still known today as the West Stockbridge Tornado.
It was about 3 p.m. on a warm Tuesday afternoon, 40 years ago today. The tornado touched down and ripped through a six-mile long corridor along the western border of West Stockbridge.
Four people were killed. Thirty-three were injured. The Berkshire Truck Plaza was destroyed. The Berkshire Farm for Boys in Canaan, N.Y., suffered heavy damage. Homes in the path of the tornado were almost obliterated.
"The carnage, the destruction, was hard to imagine unless you saw it," said Lawrence Tonini, Barbara Tonini's husband and the town's assistant fire chief at the time. "It took [West Stockbridge resident] Bill Kie's house right out."
The tornado also destroyed the home of Constantine Delmolino, 60, of Dean Hill Road. A rescuer found Delmolino, groaning, under a pile of debris that was formerly his home. Delmolino and his wife, Grace, were home when the twister hit. Both were evacuated to the former Pittsfield General Hospital, where Constantine died from his injuries.
Also killed were two truck drivers at the Plaza and a Brooklyn, N.Y., man who summered in the Berkshires.
It was nature gone berserk: A meteorological Godzilla that trampled everything in its path.

"There was a gentleman at the [Berkshire Truck] Plaza that day, a fellow named Tim Johnson," said Lawrence Tonini. "A really nice man, and a very big, strong guy. Well, he was outside at the truck stop when the tornado hit, and it knocked him over and started rolling him across the yard. He managed to grab onto a flatbed truck as he was going by and he hung on for his life."
James Overmyer, an Eagle bureau chief in South County, was sitting in his office on Main Street in Great Barrington that afternoon when the police scanner began barking.
"We were hearing, ‘High winds at the truck stop, tornado at the truck stop,' " Overmyer recalled. "So I hustled out the door of the bureau and high-tailed it to West Stockbridge."
Overmyer was the first reporter on the scene.
"You couldn't actually get too close to the truck stop by then," he said. "There was a lot of concern about leaking fuel. But it was almost better, because we just started interviewing people that saw it, that were in it."
In all, The Eagle had 13 reporters and photographers on the scene.
"I was there all week," said Overmyer. "It was a lot of follow-up, obviously. But we had people running all over the place.
"The things you remember," said Overmyer in a recent interview. "There were trucks just thrown about [after the tornado]. Big trucks. One of them was wrapped around a tree. And it must have been filled with cottage cheese, or some other dairy product. But I think it was cottage cheese. Anyway, it smelled for days before they cleaned it up."
Tonini recalled local firefighters, police and emergency personnel not getting much sleep for several days.
"It took a few days before everything got back to a semblance of normalcy," he said.
And debris was scattered over a huge swath of the Northeast corridor.
The day after the tornado hit, a check for lunch at the Berkshire Truck Plaza was found in the yard of a Wappinger, Conn., family, about 55 miles away from the plaza.
It was for a cheeseburger and a hot chocolate.

Source: U.S. Air Force Source: U.S. Air Force
A massive dike to hold back storm-driven floods surging in from the Gulf of Mexico was first proposed after Hurricane Ike devastated the Houston-area coast a decade ago.
Last year’s Hurricane Harvey disaster brought fresh enthusiasm for the languishing project – along with a wave of investor interest.
Now city and state officials in Texas are studying a possible partnership with private industry to create a new kind of bond to help pay for a $15 billion system of seawalls and floodgates, as a warming climate piles more storm risk on the nation’s fourth-largest city. They’re examining the market for catastrophe bonds, in which investors assume the risk for calamities like hurricanes in exchange for above-market returns and portfolio diversification.
“This is why we have financial markets, to come up with this type of solution,’’ said Flavio Cunha, an economics professor at Rice University. “People love when markets can come and help construct some of these projects.’’
At stake: the welfare of $500 billion in industry, including the nation’s largest concentration of oil refineries and chemical plants. The dike could prevent countless homes and lives from being swept away in the 20-foot storm surge that would accompany a direct hit from a major hurricane –- a potentially worse cataclysm than Harvey.
Proposal to Protect a $500 Billion Economic Center Source: Texas A&M Foundation
Harvey flooded hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, wreaking $125 billion in damages, a reminder of how vulnerable one of the nation’s most important economic centers remains. After a decade of indecision, officials have rallied around a plan for a seawall almost 60 miles long fitted with massive floodgates at the center to protect Galveston Bay and the industry lining the Houston Ship Channel.
The Dutch proved long ago that it can be done; Much of the Netherlands would be swamped if not for its network of levees and floodgates holding back the sea. Houston’s plan is modeled after those engineering marvels.
The Coastal Spine, also known as the Ike Dike, is the largest civil works project under consideration in the U.S., according to the Texas General Land Office. It would be a landmark deal for financial markets, too. If Houston can bring together the public and private sector, the new financing model could be replicated to reinforce communities from Florida to California against Mother Nature’s wrath.
Catastrophe Bonds
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in July committed $1.9 million for a study, and the state is seeking federal funding for construction. But under Corps rules for such projects, local governments would still need to shoulder 35 percent of the cost –- perhaps $5 billion -- plus ongoing maintenance and repairs.
To raise the money, project backers are studying catastrophe bonds, which trade on public markets and have been adopted by companies and cities as a more cost-effective way to supplement or replace conventional insurance.
“Infrastructure finance related to resilience or risk reduction, that is probably the most dynamic area where we are seeing innovation at the moment,’’ said Daniel Stander, managing director at Risk Management Solutions, a consultant.
Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Amtrak obtained $275 million of natural-disaster protection for its railway from fixed-income investors, and New York’s MTA tapped the market twice for a total $325 million for its subway system.
Texas would put its own twist on the concept, pioneering a new instrument called “ resilience bonds” that would both insure against flood damage and help fund construction of the Ike Dike, said Marvin Odum, Houston’s chief recovery officer and a retired president at Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc.
How It Works
Here’s how money for the Ike Dike could be raised from the financial markets: Oil companies, chemical makers, railroads and others with assets exposed to flood risk would collectively issue resilience bonds to replace their traditional insurance.
When the storm barrier is complete after perhaps three years, payments to the bond investors would drop to reflect the lower risk of flooding. The companies would continue paying the higher, pre-dike rate, and the difference would go toward paying off the project.
Odum has pegged the value of industry along the Texas coast at $500 billion, giving companies plenty of incentive to help fund the Ike Dike campaign. The cost of paying investors interest on the bonds shouldn’t be any greater than the cost of insurance, said Shalini Vajjhala, chief executive officer of re:focus partners, a firm that brokers public-private partnerships for sustainable infrastructure.
A Houston nonprofit has organized a panel to discuss the project on Sept. 12.
Texas Twist
So-called resilience bonds were conceived in 2015 by re:focus in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, Risk Management Solutions, and Swiss Re, but Texas’s Ike Dike project would be the first to use them.
The concept relies on local governments collaborating with business and industry, and could be replicated across the country in areas at high risk from natural disaster. Miami could sell resilience bonds to help finance seawalls to protect hotels, condominiums and other pricey real estate lining its coast, Vajjhala said.
“The market is overcapitalized at the moment so there is lots of hungry capital looking for a home,’’ RMS’s Stander said. “This is a good time to be thinking about innovative risk finance and project finance.”
Even so, Houston would be betting big on an untested model, and many obstacles remain before a deal is done, including getting industry on board.
Evolving Project
Companies generally support the idea of a coastal barrier. But even DowDuPont Inc., which operates the largest chemical complex in the western hemisphere on the coast south of Houston, remains noncommittal about pitching in on the financing: “We look forward to actively engaging in discussions about the project as they evolve,” said Rachelle Schikorra, a company spokeswoman.
Other experimental financing models could still emerge. One possibility: a hybrid that blends catastrophe and municipal bonds to help finance infrastructure like the Ike Dike while eliminating the city’s obligation in the event of a major hurricane, said Rowan Douglas at Willis Towers Watson Plc, a risk management consultant.
“It’s a concept that is gaining quite a bit of traction,” he said. “There is almost certainly going to be a movement in this direction relatively soon.”
The Ike Dike has already spent almost a decade on ice, and even if financing is arranged, an army of environmentalists and Nimbys are likely to line up against the project. Houston is determined to press ahead. Harvey’s floods only confirmed that governments need to start preventing disasters instead of just cleaning up after them, said Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership.
Meanwhile, Houston voters on Aug. 24 approved issuing $2.5 billion in debt to pay for hundreds of small flood-control projects, from property buyouts to storm water control. Odum, the Houston recovery chief, said the region may need to spend as much as $30 billion for flood mitigation in the coming decades.
Despite the daunting costs and technical challenges, the coastal spine “is not fiction,” Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in an interview. “It’s a project that should take place.”

The death toll from attacks on villages in central Mali at the weekend rose to 160, making it one of the deadliest assaults since separatists and Islamist insurgents seized swathes of the nation’s north in 2012.
The latest estimate of casualties was announced by government spokesman Amadou Koita in the capital, Bamako. The government says the March 23 raids on the village of Ogossagou and two other ethnic Fulani settlements were carried out by gunmen dressed as Dozo hunters.
The massacres took place as a United Nations Security Council mission visited Mali seeking solutions to violence that killed at least 500 civilians last year, according to the International Federation for Human Rights.

There will be some areas of New England that see over a foot of heavy, wet snow Friday night and Saturday, but Greater Boston won’t be within the heavy snow area.
As I’m working on the forecast for Friday night and Saturday, I can’t help but feel a bit of deja vu. Twenty years ago, a powerful nor’easter, which started with heavy rain, ended up bringing over 2 feet of snow to Boston (25.4”) and nearly three feet to Worcester (33.5”). That storm was the largest ever recorded in Worcester, a record that stood for 18 years. The winter of 1996-1997 hadn’t seen much snow up to the blizzard. Before the storm, Boston had only received 26.5 inches of snow. By the time it was over, the season would record 51.9 inches, and that was above average.

The April 1997 blizzard ranks as one of the top winter storms ever recorded in Southern New England and certainly the biggest late-season storm in modern times.
Meteorologically, the storm was a powerhouse. Temperatures the day before the storm reached into the 60s, and with the mild air in place precipitation began as rain. There was some doubt from the public that so much snow would fall after such mild spring weather. As the storm intensified off the coastline, it pulled down colder air from the north as well as from the higher parts of the atmosphere.
The rapid intensification of the storm created widespread thundersnow, with a foot of snow falling in Boston over just four hours, from 11 p.m March 31 through the early morning hours of April 1. When New Englanders awoke that morning, snow had piled up to almost unprecedented levels for so late in the season.

At the height of the storm, winds gusted to over 70 miles per hour and more than 700,000 people were without power throughout New England, most of them in Massachusetts. Tree damage was also an issue from the weight of the snow and the strong winds. In Charlestown, the top of one of the masts of Old Ironsides was sheared off completely.

The April blizzard, while highly unusual, was not unique. There have been major snowstorms in other years, including as recently as 1982 when a similar storm dumped up to 2 feet of snow on April 5-7. April 1996 gave Boston 7.3 inches of snow capping off the 107.6 inches that fell that winter. A recently as last year, 6.6 inches of snow fell at Logan International Airport from April 3 to April 4.

It originated near Salt Lake City and traveled in a straight line northeast until it changed directions near Detroit, where it curved south. This is the path the storm followed all the way to just south of Boston.
Around this time in 1888, New Englanders were not basking in near-50-degree sunny weather. Instead, they were battling a blizzard that killed 400 people and dumped almost 60 inches of snow on some parts of the East Coast.

â€œFor three days it travelled very slowly, but by being kept confined by the heavier air surrounding it, its intensity grew in proportion to its restraint, and yesterday, when the last well-defined reports of it were received in Boston, it was crowded into a small area over the lake region, giving high winds and snow,â€? the Globe reported on March 12, 1888.
The Great White Hurricane lingered on the East Coast for about three days, hitting eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, eastern New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and most of Maine, the Globe reported.
â€œFortunately for Boston, while it is nearest the centre of the storm, it has so far escaped the most violent part of it, the usual rule of cyclones, that the most violent winds are in the southern half, being carried out upon this occasion,â€? the Globe reported on March 13, 1888.
Nearly all telegraph and telephone wires went down and railways were blocked, according to Globe archives, effectively isolating Boston from the rest of the region. However, there were no serious casualties in the city, according to the archives.
Other areas werenâ€™t as lucky.

â€œChildren died trying to get home from school and adults perished in snowdrifts higher than their heads,â€? according to the New England Historical Society. â€œTelegraph boys tied wires around their waists so they could be pulled out of the drifts.â€?
In Springfield, a little girl was found buried in a snow bank when a man went to get a hat stuck in the snow, according to the historical society. In New York, about 200 people froze to death, the Globe reported.

Smith, 67, was convicted by a Morrison County jury in the Thanksgiving Day 2012 shooting deaths of Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin Nicholas Brady, 16, in his rural Little Falls home. Smith, a retired security engineer with the U.S. State Department and Little Falls native, said he was defending himself.
Defense attorney Steven Meshbesher said Smith acted out of fear after multiple home break-ins. Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling.
The state's prosecutor, Washington County attorney Peter Orput, said Smith crossed the line between self defense and murder. Prosecutors said after wounding the teenagers, who were unarmed, Smith should have called police. Authorities said Smith planned the killings, moved his vehicle away from the home, sat in his basement as surveillance equipment nearby showed the teenagers breaking in, shot them repeatedly and in the head after they were wounded and on the basement floor.
Smith's own audio recordings of the event showed 11 minutes passed between the time he killed Brady and when he shot Kifer. During that time Smith wrapped Brady's body in a tarp and moved him to another room and reloaded his gun. The Ramsey County Medical Examiner reported Brady was shot three times and Kifer six times.
Smith left the bodies in his basement overnight. A neighbor, at Smith's request, called law enforcement the following day. Smith told investigators he didn't call law enforcement because he didn't want to trouble them on the Thanksgiving holiday.
Smith did not testify during the trial. Meshbesher said he advised against Smith taking the stand. The trial began April 21, 2014. Closing arguments began eight days later.
A pool of 140 jurors were assembled in the court's process to obtain its jury panel. The jury reached its verdict after about three hours and 20 minutes of deliberation. Smith was sentenced to life in prison.""" ;

Who was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen”? Test your knowledge of U.S. presidents and first ladies with this in-depth quiz.
At the Republican convention in Chicago in June, Hoover was renominated easily, but there was a battle for the vice presidential slot as Vice Pres. Charles Curtis was challenged unsuccessfully by James Harbord , who had served as John Pershing’s chief of staff in World War I . At the Democratic convention in Chicago two weeks later, Roosevelt had the support of a majority of the delegates, but the Democratic Party rules required a two-thirds majority to win nomination. On the first ballot Roosevelt was shy of victory by more than 100 delegates, with his main opposition coming from Smith and John Nance Garner , who had been elected speaker of the House of Representatives in 1931. After three ballots Garner released his delegates, and on the fourth ballot Roosevelt won the party nomination. Garner was duly selected unanimously as the vice presidential candidate. Roosevelt then broke tradition by appearing in person to accept the party’s nomination. In his speech before the delegates, he said, “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.”
The campaign
The depression was the only issue of consequence in the presidential campaign of 1932. The American public had to choose between the apparently unsuccessful policies of the incumbent Hoover, who blamed the depression on external events and alleged that Roosevelt would intensify the disaster, and the vaguely defined New Deal program presented by Roosevelt. While Roosevelt avoided specifics, he made clear that his program for economic recovery would make extensive use of the power of the federal government. In a series of addresses carefully prepared by a team of advisers popularly known as the Brain Trust, he promised aid to farmers, public development of electric power, a balanced budget, and government policing of irresponsible private economic power. Besides having policy differences, the two candidates presented a stark contrast in personal demeanour as well. Roosevelt was genial and exuded confidence, while Hoover remained unremittingly grim and dour. On election day Roosevelt received nearly 23 million popular votes (57.3 percent) to Hoover’s nearly 16 million (39.6 percent); the electoral vote was 472 to 59. In a repudiation not just of Hoover but also of the Republican Party, Americans also elected substantial Democratic majorities to both houses of Congress.

In the four months between the election and Roosevelt’s inauguration, Hoover sought Roosevelt’s cooperation in stemming the deepening economic crisis. But the two were unable to find common ground, as Roosevelt refused to subscribe to Hoover’s proposals, which Hoover himself admitted would mean “the abandonment of 90 percent of the so-called new deal.” As a result, the economy continued to decline. By inauguration day—March 4, 1933—most banks had shut down, industrial production had fallen to just 56 percent of its 1929 level, at least 13 million wage earners were unemployed, and farmers were in desperate straits. In his inaugural address Roosevelt promised prompt, decisive action, and he conveyed some of his own unshakable self-confidence to millions of Americans listening on radios throughout the land. “This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and prosper,” he asserted, adding, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

In January 1971 McGovern announced his candidacy for the 1972 presidential election. Initially, most political observers assumed that the party’s nominee would be Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine. But McGovern’s team hoped to mount a serious challenge in New Hampshire, which on March 7, 1972, would hold the first primary. A victory there, they hoped, would provide the momentum necessary to capture the nomination.

Early on, Muskie lined up leading Democratic politicians to endorse him, including Gov. John Gilligan of Ohio; Leonard Woodcock, president of the United Auto Workers; Iowa Sen. Harold Hughes; and Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp. Muskie ran an exhausting campaign that stretched his energies and resources thin. Through January and February 1972, he shuttled between New Hampshire, Florida, Wisconsin and all the other necessary stops. On February 26, in New Hampshire, the pressure began to tell. Mounting the bed of a truck parked outside the offices of the conservative Manchester Union Leader, the state’s largest newspaper, Muskie launched an attack on the paper’s publisher, William Loeb. As he spoke of Loeb’s unflattering remarks about Mrs. Muskie, the senator’s voice cracked, and the crowd saw tears form in his eyes. The spectacle badly dented the image Muskie had tried all year to present—that of a calm, trustworthy, serene candidate. When New Hampshire voted on March 7, Muskie won the hollowest of victories, 46 percent of the vote, far below the predicted 65 percent. McGovern, reaping the benefit of his early start and vigorous organization, was close behind with 37 percent.
In Florida the Democratic battle turned over the issue of busing. In January 1972 a U.S. District Court judge merged school districts in Richmond, Va., and ordered that students be bused to achieve racial balance. Gov. George Wallace of Alabama, an opponent of federally ordered integration, entered the Florida primary and focused squarely on the issue. Florida Gov. Reubin Askew campaigned statewide against having an antibusing referendum placed on the presidential primary ballot by the Florida legislature. Lacking the votes in the legislature to keep the antibusing question off the ballot, Askew managed to have another question added: “Do you favor providing an equal opportunity for quality education for all children regardless of race, creed, color or place of residence, and oppose a return to a dual system of public schools?”

Askew’s campaign focused the rage of many of his constituents on him, and the Democratic presidential candidates, of which there were 11, found themselves discussing busing much more often than they might otherwise have wished. Mayor John Lindsay of New York City, Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York, former senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, and Senator McGovern, all liberal candidates, spoke in favour of busing when asked. Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana, Rep. Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, and Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles, although on the ballot, were not campaigning actively. Senator Muskie and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota bobbed and weaved on the issue. Only Wallace and Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington spoke out squarely against busing.
As the race grew more intense, political observers began to doubt that, with 11 names on the Democratic ballot, anyone could win a clear victory. George Wallace proved them wrong by taking 42 percent of Florida’s statewide vote and nearly all of the 81 delegates to the Democratic national convention. Senator Humphrey was second, with 18 percent, and got the few remaining delegates. Senator Jackson received 13 percent, just enough to convince him not to withdraw from the race. Muskie, with 9 percent, lost his front-runner status. McGovern, who had written off Florida early, finished with 6 percent. The antibusing referendum passed by 75 percent, and the equal-opportunity ballot question passed with 79 percent approval.
The Muskie campaign limped on to Wisconsin for its April 4 primary. With busing receding from importance, property tax became central, particularly for the Wallace and McGovern campaigns. McGovern’s year-old campaign organization paid off, as he finished first with 30 percent of the popular vote. Surprisingly, Wallace finished second with 22 percent, buttressed by the fact that some one-third of the state’s Republican voters crossed party lines to vote for him. Humphrey, who had worked 19-hour days in the state where he was supposed to be beloved as “our third senator,” finished third with 21 percent. Muskie finished a distant fourth with 10 percent. The Wisconsin vote finished the candidacy of Lindsay.
Humphrey decided to focus his attention and waning resources on Pennsylvania’s primary. Humphrey’s decision suited the McGovern forces. Their plan called next for intensive work in Massachusetts, considered the most liberal state in the country, where they could expect courtesy if not outright public support from Sen. Ted Kennedy. On April 25 the strategies of both Humphrey and McGovern paid off, and the hopes of Senator Muskie were crushed between them. He finished fourth in Pennsylvania, behind winner Humphrey, Wallace, and McGovern, and finished a distant second to McGovern in Massachusetts. Muskie then withdrew from the campaign.
On May 15, as Wallace campaigned in Maryland, a state he was expected to win, he was shot four times by 21-year-old Arthur Bremer. Wallace survived, but he was paralyzed from the waist down. Maryland’s voters surged out on election day to give Wallace a huge victory, his last of 1972. Wallace received many visits from Democratic and Republican politicians, and many wondered if he would endorse anyone else for the presidency. While he recuperated, many of his supporters began to move in overwhelming proportions behind Nixon’s candidacy.
In the primaries that followed, McGovern continued to build up a lead in convention delegates. He was even more successful in the nonprimary states, where his devoted followers made certain that delegate-selection caucuses voted his way. But that success overrode the much more basic process that was taking place: the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart. One reason lay in the work of the commission that carried McGovern’s name. Founded in the wake of the disastrous and violent Democratic National Convention in 1968, the McGovern Commission put forth guidelines for the selection of delegates. They were designed to open the party’s deliberations to more young people, to African Americans, and to women. The guidelines worked, but they also functioned to diminish the participation of many longtime Democratic Party workers. Prominent national Democrats found themselves in some cases unable to find a spot on their own states’ delegations.
McGovern’s rise made many Democrats nervous. Some were worried about his antiwar views, while others thought that he went against traditional Democratic principles. For many, unfairly or not, McGovern came to symbolize a candidacy of radical children, rioters, marijuana smokers, draft dodgers, and hippies. With the California primary approaching, Humphrey tried to bring all the objections to McGovern together in a last attempt to save the nomination for himself. He excoriated his old Senate friend for his expensive ideas on welfare and his desire to cut the defense budget. It almost worked. Humphrey closed fast in May and early June, but the McGovern organization held on. McGovern won all of California’s giant delegation, and he beat Humphrey 44.3 to 39.1 percent in the popular vote. The margin was not as large as McGovern had hoped for, and the bitterness of the fight, together with the effectiveness of the Humphrey charges, had not been lost on the silent watchers at the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP).""" ;

[Monday] and tomorrow evening into Newfoundland,"Environment Canada's senior climatologist, Dave Phillips, told the Canadian Press.
"When it finally just blows away up there in Newfoundland and out in the North [Atlantic] it will have created a lot of misery," he said.
Thestormleft up to 30 centimetres of snow in parts of Ontario and 60centimetres in some parts of Quebec.
Snow started to fallon theEast Coastlate Sunday. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Islandwere expected to be pummelledwith heavy snow and 90 kilometre-an-hour winds.
Numerous cancellations were already reported at Halifax International Airport.
The storm, packing high winds, first hitsouthern Ontario late Saturday,unleashingheavy snow and ice pellets from Windsor, Ont., all the way to Ottawa. It then moved eastward on Sunday.
At leastone person has been reported killed in the wake of the crippling storm.A woman died near London, Ont., when her vehicle was struck by a snowplow while she stood outside of it, the Ontario Provincial Police reported.
Poor visibility and whiteouts caused hazardous road conditions. The OPP reported about 400 collisions, most of them minor accidents.
Officials at Toronto's Pearson International Airport had to cancel or delay 185 arriving flights and 80 departing flights on Sunday, after cancelling about 30 flights on Saturday night.

VIA Rail said all trains were operating normally in Ontario and Quebec on Sunday. However,some were experiencing delays of about 30 minutes.
Ottawa was hit with 31centimetresof snowfall, surpassingits one-day record of 30centimetresset in 1977, and forcing the cancellation ofabout 80 flights. But Environment Canada meteorologist Rene Heroux said the capital could be blanketed by as much as 40 centimetres by the end of the snowfall.
Storm batters Montreal
Several flights in and out of Montreal were alsodelayed or cancelled because the storm, which was expected to dump40 centimetres on the city.
Highway 40 near Repentigny, Que., was ice-covered. Most other roads in the province were snow-covered.
Transport Quebec's Bruno Lacombe said several people had driven off the highways because of the snowy conditions.

The storm is giving way to a deep freeze, with the temperature expected to fall to –22 C in the evening. On Wednesday, it will be about–17 C, according to Environment Canada.
"It will becolder than normal," meteorologist René Héroux told CBC News Online. "Normally, at this time, the high is –6 C and the low is –15 C."
Monday's storm caused havoc onhighways across the province.
Chantal Mackel, a spokeswoman for the provincial police, said police responded to more than 100 accidents Monday night.
24 students to hospital after bus crash
In one of the most serious accidents,24 American students were taken to hospital in Drummondville after the bus they were in tried to pass another vehicle on Highway 20, lost control and tipped onto its side, Mackel said.
No one was seriously injuredin theaccident, which was at about 2:20 p.m. ET.
The buswas carrying about 40 studentsreturning homeafter aski trip. Mackel didn't know where the students were from or where they had skied.
While police cleaned up accidents across the province, 1,200 snowplows were sent out Monday to begin clearing theroads.
Montrealers were also busy shovelling driveways Monday.
"I have a son who's seven and we're anxious to go skiing, so we're glad it's actually snowing," Montrealer Mark Pannesac said as he shovelled for the first time this year.

Alexandre Morin left his house in Sillery about 5 p.m. ET to go for a jog and hasn't been seen since. Police are concerned the teen hurt himself and is lost in the heavy snowfall that blanketed the city overnight.
About a dozen volunteers joined police, family and friends who are combing the area around Morin's house.
Elsewhere in Quebec, people continue to deal with the aftermath of the storm, which also dumped 55 centimetres in the Eastern Townships and 25 in Montreal before moving eastward to the Maritimes.
The storm caused chaos on Quebec roads and highways where drivers faced a treacherous commute further hampered by low visibility and black ice. Hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed at Trudeau airport, while thousands of students got the day off when several school boards cancelled classes.
Sherbrooke was the worst hit — record-setting snowfall paralyzed the city. By Wednesday night dozens of abandoned cars littered snowbanks and side streets, while traffic ground to a standstill as commuters inched their way home through the drifting snow.
Some parents with children in the Région-de-Sherbrooke School Board were angered by an administrative decision to keep students at school despite the storm, while classes were cancelled in most of the region.
Blowing snow warning
Snow is still blowing through Quebec City and the Beauce region, where Environment Canada predicts up to 45 centimetres could accumulate before the storm's end. The weather office has issued a blowing snow warning for several regions including the Lower North Shore, the Lower Saint-Lawrence and the Gaspé regions.
The heavy snowfall continues to cause difficulties on several Quebec highways. Transport Quebec closed several routes Thursday , including:
Highway 20, between Lévis and Saint-Jean-Port-Joli.
Route 132, between Baie-des-Sables and Matane.
Route 195, between Amqui and Matane.
Provincial police reported hundreds of accidents but no major collisions or victims.
Several schools across the province remain closed on Thursday, including:
Eastern Townships School Board.
Sherbrooke School Board.
Sommets School Board.
Collège Rivier, Coaticook.
Collège Sacré-Coeur.
Champlain College, Lennoxville campus.

Snow removal in Sherbrooke and Montreal is underway but could take several days.It may take city workers in Sherbrooke up to a week to haul away the snow because of the sheer number of abandoned vehicles buried in snowbanks and alleys, officials said.
The city urged people to stay home if they can. The snowfall in Sherbrooke broke a previous record, set in Feb. 1994, when 42 centimetres fell on the region.
In Montreal, snow removal trucks were dispatched Wednesday evening, but it will take until at least Friday to clear the streets, said Marcel Tremblay, a member of the Montreal's executive committee responsible for security.
"The most important thing is that people use the metro, be secure, and on our side, we're gonna do the best we can to clean [the snow]," he said Wednesday.""" ;

<https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fredericton-shooting-joshua-cochrane-hallelujah-tribute-1.4783017> dct:description """A Yarmouth, N.S., boy's Facebook tribute to the victims of the Fredericton shooting has been viewed almost 400,000 times and shared more than 12,000 times.
Joshua Cochrane, 12, sings a song to the tune of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, where the lyrics reflect police officers' experience on the job.
Cochrane said he sang the song in honour of the two police officers who died in the Friday shooting that also killed two civilians.
"When I was watching the news and I saw the terror in the eyes and the hurt the people who saw everything were going through and their comments about how unsafe they felt in their own community, it made me think of what was going through the officers' minds," he told CBC's The National.
Cochrane, who has autism, is well-known for his singing and has helped raise more than $300,000 by singing for various causes over the years.
Cochrane said it breaks his heart knowing that some kids won't have their parents around anymore to tuck them into bed at night.
He said he posted the video because he believes music is a powerful tool for healing.
"It helps you speak from your heart," said Cochrane. "It helps bring calmness."
Cochrane said he understands the loss being felt by people right now. A friend of Cochrane's family, Kirk Taylor, died in 2009 in Afghanistan from a bomb blast. Cochrane called Taylor his hero.
"I know the hurt and anger you go through after horrible things happen," he said. "People need to know we are there for them."
Cochrane said he received a message from someone who said watching the video may have saved their life.
"When something bad like this happens in the world, it's hard to see past the bad. I wanted to help people only see the good," said Cochrane.

<https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/faisal-hussein-friends-1.4758969> dct:description """When Aamir Sukhera learned that a young man he saw as a little brother was behind the deadly mass shooting on Toronto's bustling Danforth strip, he couldn't bring himself to believe the news.
"It's like two different people, it doesn't make sense," Sukhera told CBC News one day after the rampage that left two people dead — including a 10-year-old girl and 18-year-old woman — and injured 13 others.
Eight years before Faisal Hussain opened fire in the city's vibrant Greektown neighbourhood, he disclosed to Sukhera that he was suffering from psychosis and depression, and was getting professional help.
"I felt like an older brother, but I guess I wasn't," Sukhera said. "I feel bad right now because I wish I had the ability to identify what triggered this sort of behaviour, but I don't."
Aamir Sukhera, friend of shooter, describes Faisal Hussain as always smiling but kept to himself 0:12 Aamir Sukhera was a close friend of Faisal Hussain and says he knew he had mental illness, but he thought he was doing fine. 0:12
"I can't say why he did it or not. I wish he had talked to me about something like this. But do people talk to someone before they do something like that? I don't know."
Toronto police executed a search warrant at Hussain's apartment in the Thorncliffe Park area on Monday, but were releasing no potential motive for the shooting at this time.
On Tuesday, the federal public safety minister's office said local police will continue to lead the investigation into Hussain's background.
"There is no national security nexus at this time," communications officer Hilary Peirce said in an email to CBC.
Shoppers Drug Mart confirmed Tuesday that Hussain worked part-time at one of the company's locations.
'I couldn't see anything wrong'
Sukhera, who said he felt Hussain trusted him, came to know the 29-year-old through a Toastmasters public speaking course that Sukhera ran.
"He was shy and reserved. I thought it would be a good idea for him, that it might help him open up and speak."
Hussain, 29, lived with his mother, father and brother in a highrise in Toronto's Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood. Neighbours and friends described him as quiet but mild-mannered and always polite. (Adrian Cheung/CBC)
It was through that relationship that he learned Hussain was struggling. But there were never any signs of trouble, certainly no indications that he was violent.
And it was the same when he ran into the 29-year-old three weeks ago at the nearby mall.
"He had a million-dollar smile, and he was very upbeat and happy whenever I saw him. I didn't identify any triggers. I couldn't see anything wrong."
Neighbours of Hussain's family had similar memories of Hussain, who lived with his mother, father and brother in a highrise in Toronto's Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood.
A series of tragedies
Quiet and reserved with strangers, Hussain was always mild-mannered and polite, recalled Khalid Malik, a friend of Hussain's father.
Malik would often run into Hussain outside on his way to and from work, most recently at a local Shoppers Drug Mart.
Torontonians turned out in great numbers to a vigil for the victims of the deadly Danforth shooting one day after the rampage. (Alan Habbick/CBC)
"When he comes around six o'clock, seven o'clock, I say, 'Faisal, who is cooking? Your mom is at the hospital.' He'd say, 'Oh [Malik], I'll make a sandwich."
That was a typical day for Hussain, said Malik. His parents made daily hospital visits to see his brother, who has been in a coma for nearly a year and a half following an accident. It was the latest in a series of tragedies for the family: several years ago, Hussain's sister died in a separate accident.
"They've been through a lot," Sukhera said.
(Sukhera remembers Hussain saying that his hours at the Shoppers Drug Mart were cut back, but that he didn't seem upset about it.)
'Our hearts are in pieces for the victims'
According to a statement by the Hussain family Monday, "the interventions of professionals were unsuccessful. Medications and therapies were unable to treat him," and while they did their best to get help for Hussain, Sunday night's "devastating and destructive end" was something they could never foresee.
"Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy," the family said in a statement, citing their son's "horrific actions."
Where or how Hussain could have obtained a gun remains a mystery to the family friends and neighbours who spoke with CBC News.
For his part, Sukhera said he's struggling to reconcile the memory of the smiling, polite, quiet young man he mentored with the image of a gunman, clad in black garb, shooting through windows at people enjoying a warm summer evening.

Frostbite and bitter weather have been blamed for 650 deaths in Afghanistan already this winter.
Temperatures have plummetted to a low of -30 C, and there has been up to 180 centimetres of snow in the more mountainous regions, said Abdul Qadir Qadir, head of the meteorology department.
It's the coldest the impoverished, war-ravaged country has been in at least a decade — as far back as weather records go.
Aid organizations and foreign soldiers have distributed several tonnes of clothing, blankets, food and fuel in provinces throughout the country and in remote, mountainous villages.
Afghanistan is largely mountainous and many people live in remote villages reachable only by foot. It's one of the poorest countries in the world, and most people live in mud and thatch homes heated by burning wood, coal or dung.
Frostbite victim laments fate
In a hospital in Herat, several Afghan men lie in beds, the stubs of their amputated arms and legs wrapped in fresh bandages. They are frostbite victims.
Many of them are shepherds, who were caught when a blizzard shrouded the western province in blinding snow and left them stranded.
"I was surrounded by snow for two days and I couldn't find my way back," said Ahmad Sadiq, 18, whose uncle died in the storm.
One of his feet has been amputated and doctors have decided the other will have to go, too.
"I don't want to live like this. I can't walk anymore," he said. "It's better to die than to live like this."
In Kabul, 70 families displaced from Helmand province, where NATO soldiers have been fighting the Taliban, live in a camp where children walk barefoot in the freezing mud and snow.
Many of the "houses" are like that of 30-year-old Fatima and her family — a rectangular hole a couple of metres deep covered by a tarp. "My children are all sick and are coughing throughout the night," said Fatima, who goes by only one name.

<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-opinion-poll-georgia-north-carolina-supreme-court-09-27-2020/> dct:description """Voters say the Supreme Court vacancy has added to the already high stakes of the presidential election.
In the battlegrounds of Georgia and North Carolina, most say it makes the election feel even more important — it's one more factor in an election in which most voters from both parties think their culture and way of life are at stake.
President Trump's voters here think the Democrats want society to change too fast, and Joe Biden's voters think Republicans want to go back to the past. The court fight may not be changing votes, since most were already locked in, but many describe it as adding even more motivation to the race. Both sides are about equally likely to say they'll vote (and some already have). In two contests that will turn almost entirely on turnout, that's essential.
And as important as the Supreme Court is, voters tell us it is just one of the major topics on their minds. Issues of race continue to split voters in these fast-growing, changing Southern states, and views on the protests are a major factor, too. The Black voters who make up sizable shares of the electorate here voice agreement with the Black Lives Matter movement, as do White Democrats, but the president's supporters say too much attention is being paid to discrimination against Black people today.
And it all adds up to a razor-thin horse race: Georgia remains a toss-up, with Mr. Trump up just a point; it favored Biden by a point this summer. North Carolina sees Biden up two; he had a four-point edge this summer.
In each state the president has consolidated support, maintains leads with non-college White voters and men, and is seen as better on the economy. Biden's support remains steady, bolstered by performing well with women and Black voters, and by improving on Democrats' 2016 performance among White women with college degrees.
It's a pattern across all the states we've been polling of late as we head into the first debate: Biden has not added to the big leads he had all summer, and things show a general, if slight, tightening toward the president's way overall.
Mr. Trump is up comfortably in neighboring South Carolina, but that state offers some real Senate drama of its own.
The Supreme Court
Amid protests from Democratic leaders citing 2016 precedent, Republican voters think Mr. Trump should pick the next justice, and when asked why, they choose as the top reason, "a sitting president's nominee should always get a vote." Republicans also overwhelmingly say the Senate should hold a vote on Mr. Trump's nominee before the election.
And about half of voters in these states say they are now more motivated to vote because of the high court vacancy, but both sides had been intending to vote already, and some already have. Biden and Mr. Trump are running neck-and-neck in these states among voters who say the court is a major factor in their decision.
Still, as Senate Democrats face decisions on how to approach things from here, most voters say the Democrats should consider the nominee on the merits. (The poll was taken before Judge Amy Coney Barrett was named and did not name any specific nominee.) But Democrats' own voters want them to do everything they can to stop it.
When it comes to some of the issues being discussed amid the Supreme Court debate, in North Carolina, a majority — 55% of likely voters — say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while only 16% say it should be illegal in all cases. A majority approve of the Affordable Care Act, and 75% say health insurance companies should be required to cover preexisting conditions at the same rates as everyone else.
And don't forget the economy. It still outranks the court as a major factor in vote, largely because it's one thing both parties both agree on as important. (By contrast, Republicans are comparably less concerned about the coronavirus.) Mr. Trump enjoys an advantage on the economy here, as he does in other battleground states.
The Senate
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina all have Republican senators up for reelection this year, and Senate control may hinge on these races. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the group is in South Carolina, a reliably Republican state where Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison has pulled almost even with incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham. We find Graham just a point up, with more South Carolina voters saying he agrees with Mr. Trump too much, rather than the right amount.
How Graham handles the confirmation hearings appears to be a wash for him, with nearly half saying it won't affect their Senate vote if he votes for the nominee. The rest divided on partisan lines.
North Carolina presents the Democrats with a pickup opportunity, with challenger Cal Cunningham still leading Senator Thom Tillis by a wide margin in a race that hasn't changed since the summer. The president, in a tight race of his own here, again looks to be a factor. More North Carolinians think Tillis agrees with Mr. Trump too much, rather than the right amount.
A Tillis vote for Mr. Trump's nominee would please most Republicans and looks like a slight net-negative among independents in North Carolina.
Of the three states we polled this week, Senate Republicans' best prospects of holding a seat are currently in Georgia, where incumbent David Perdue leads challenger Jon Ossoff by five points.
Race and the protests
In these states, where Black voters make up large shares of the electorate, race and partisanship mark sharp divisions in how voters view the protests about police treatment of African Americans.
Most Black voters here — as they do nationwide — strongly agree with the ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement and think too little attention is being paid to issues of racial discrimination against Black people.
Among White voters in these states, partisanship defines differences. Most White Democrats agree with Black voters on these issues, but most White Republicans think that too much attention is being paid to the issue of racial discrimination against Black people, and feel that Joe Biden, as a candidate, pays too much attention to the needs and concerns of Black people, and too little to those of White people.
By contrast, about half of White Republicans think more attention needs to be paid to issues of discrimination against White people.
Black voters think Donald Trump is paying too much attention to the needs and problems of White people and too little to those of Black people. (In contrast, they see Joe Biden as paying the right amount of attention to both groups.)
We see a similar racial divide over how the candidates are handling the recent protests about the treatment of African Americans by police. Most Black voters, as well as most White Democratic voters, approve of Biden's handling of the protests and strongly disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling them. Most White Republicans strongly approve of Mr. Trump and strongly disapprove of Biden.
Most likely voters in Georgia and North Carolina say the protests will be a major factor in their vote, though it trails the economy in importance. White voters and Black voters factor in the protests in about equal measure, though an electoral connection exists only among White voters. White voters say the protests are a major factor and overwhelmingly back Mr. Trump's reelection. White voters for whom the protests are less of a factor are more evenly split between Mr. Trump and Biden. (Black voters overwhelmingly support Biden, regardless of the importance they place on protests.)
We see a divide among White voters by gender and education on how Mr. Trump is handling the protests, particularly in North Carolina. Most White voters without a college degree — in particular men — approve of the president's approach to the protests. Among White voters with college degrees, we see a gender divide: Men tend to approve of the president's approach, while women tend to disapprove.
One thing that cuts across party lines is that most voters, Black and White, don't think that it is likely that large violent demonstrations accompanied by rioting and looting will come to their town, not even in the suburbs. In Georgia, less than a third say this is even somewhat likely.
Vote by mail
A big part of that turnout equation: Most of the vote in Georgia and North Carolina battlegrounds will be cast before November 3.
Democrats plan to vote by mail or vote early. As of now, the in-person vote in North Carolina looks like it will be more Republican, putting pressure on them to turn out, but we've certainly seen that happen in North Carolina in prior years.
In both states, Republicans say they find the voting process overall easier than Democrats do. In North Carolina, seven in 10 Republicans call it very easy, versus four in 10 Democrats who describe it that way. And in Georgia, Republicans calling it very easy outnumber Democrats by 2 to 1. That'll be something to watch closely as voters navigate their options over the next couple of weeks.
And amid all the heated discussion over how to vote and voting methods, voters are somewhat, if not very, confident that their votes will be counted properly. Democrats are less confident than Republicans.
These surveys were conducted on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between September 22-25, 2020. They are based on representative samples of 1,164 registered voters in Georgia, 1,213 in North Carolina, and 1,080 in South Carolina. Margins of error for registered voters are +/- 3.3 points in Georgia, +/- 3.6 points in North Carolina, and +/- 3.8 points in South Carolina.

U.S. Census Bureau History: 1900 Galveston Hurricane
September 2015 marks the 115th anniversary of the 1900 Galveston Hurricane—a Category 4 storm that swept through the Caribbean and Florida in early September and made landfall at Galveston, TX, on September 8, 1900. The storm was so destructive that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration still characterizes the 1900 Galveston Hurricane as the "greatest natural disaster to ever strike the United States."
Galveston, a barrier island located approximately 50 miles southeast of Houston, TX, was particularly vulnerable to hurricanes because of its low elevation. In 1900, Galveston's highest point was a mere 9 feet above sea level, but the hurricane's storm surge reached more than 15 feet. The hurricane's surge and 145 mph winds killed an estimated 8,000 people (20 percent of the city's population) and swept away more than 3,600 homes, leaving 30,000 homeless.
Galveston's population recovered quickly after the 1900 hurricane with its population peaking at 67,175 in 1960. Despite being a frequent target of tropical storms and hurricanes, Galveston's Gulf of Mexico location continues to make it a popular destination for tourists and beachgoers and the city's port facilities attract maritime trade and cruise lines. The 2013 American Community Survey found that educational services, health care, and social assistance industries employ 6,699 (30.8 percent) of the city's population and 3,713 (17.1 percent) worked in the arts, entertainment, and recreation, or accommodation and food services industries.
You can learn more about the 1900 Galveston Hurricane and the city of Galveston, TX, using data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies. For example:
This Month in Census History
The U.S. Senate confirmed Sandra Day O'Connor as the first female Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on September 21, 1981.
In January 1999, Justice O'Connor voted to halt the U.S. Census Bureau's proposal to use statistical sampling during the 2000 Census. In her dissenting opinion, Justice O'Connor stated, "[The law] directly prohibits the use of sampling in the determination of population for purposes of apportionment."
On This Day in History
Hurricane Ike struck Galveston, TX, on September 12–13, 2008. The storm flooded most of the city, damaged 80 percent of its homes, and killed 17 people.
In 2007, the American Community Survey estimated Galveston was home to 53,826 people and 33,336 housing units. Five years after Hurricane Ike, the city had not fully recovered— recording a population of 48,237 and 32,564 housing units.
In comparison, Galveston County's overall population has grown from 279,604 in 2007 to 314,198 in 2014.

Did You Know?
In 1902, Galveston began constructing a 16-foot thick, 17-foot tall seawall and In 1902, Galveston began constructing a 16-foot thick, 17-foot tall seawall and raised the island's elevation by 8 feet using sand dredged from Galveston Bay.
The seawall protects Galveston's 4,071 businesses from storms like 1983's Hurricane Alicia, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates could have caused $100 million in damage. It was not until 2008 that a storm (Hurricane Ike) overtopped the seawall.

<https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/galveston/article/The-story-behind-a-lost-statue-honoring-victims-12861181.php> dct:description """A statue honoring victims of Galveston's deadly 1900 hurricane has been missing for nearly 100 years and the search is on to learn its whereabouts.
Florentine sculptor Pompeo Coppini created "Victims of the Galveston Flood" that same year, in honor of the thousands who died in Galveston when that monstrous storm came ashore.
NATURE'S TOLL: Looking back at the 1900 hurricane that wiped out Galveston
Project manager John Bernardoni with the Lost Coppini Statue Project says that for two years now he and his team have been trying to find the 10-foot-tall statue that went missing in 1919.
The history of the statue has many twists and turns, starting in 1900 with William Randolph Hearst's Galveston Orphan's Bazaar at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel that October.
Coppini created a maquette of what the statue was to look like, a first draft of sorts, to be auctioned off to raise funds for the victims of the natural disaster. In all, around $500,000 was raised for needy islanders and Coppini was summoned to Galveston to show his artwork to the city fathers.
OLD TIMEY: Vintage pictures of Galveston, Texas' underrated jewel
What wasn't accounted for was the emotional turmoil that Galveston residents were still mired in after losing so many friends and loved ones. The dramatic sculpture of a mother holding a small child in the middle of the storm with another on her waist speaks to the horror.
According to Bernardoni, city leaders told Coppini that the event was still too raw and fresh in their minds to think of a statue.
Bernardoni says that the plaster statue was later on display at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Three photos of the statue survive to this day.
The Lost Coppini Statue Project
It eventually ended up at the University of Texas, along with other works of art, before it went missing during the 1919 campus holiday break. The artist never got a straight answer and he died in 1957 in San Antonio, the city in which his Alamo Cenotaph is on display near the Alamo.
Other works by Coppini depicting Confederate heroes like Jefferson Davis have just recently been removed from public view after years of community complaint.
According to the Texas State Historical Association, there are 36 public monuments, 16 portrait statues, and about 25 portrait busts created by Coppini currently in the United States. He was a busy man and Texans have no doubt seen his work countless times and haven't realized it.
Bernardoni and the Lost Coppini Statue Project would like to recreate the lost work of art in bronze at a height of 10 feet. The cost? $450,000 according to Bernardoni. It would be given to the city of Galveston as a gift.
(Galveston does have a statue dedicated to the 1900 storm, created by artist David Moore and installed in 2000 just off Seawall Boulevard.)
Bernardoni has a very real family tie to the storm's drama too.
TEXAS TIME: 25 awesome maps that help explain Texas
"My great grandfather, from Italy, died in the storm trying to help another family after securing his own," he says. He left behind a wife and two kids.
For Bernardoni it would not only be honoring those 6,000 who died and those left behind, but also his own lineage. He has even had archivist Ralph Elder perform an exhaustive search of the UT storehouses to see if its just been misplaced.
LM Otero/AP
"This isn't just another statue," Bernardoni says. "We have a chance to fulfill history, finally."
He has a few theories about what ultimately happened to the statue. It's thought that it possibly broke apart while it was being moved around campus and was silently thrown out as damaged goods.
Another theory is that it was destroyed on purpose by a UT staff member who didn't get along with Coppini. There is some evidence that the artist and faculty member J. Frank Dobie were not friendly and he had a hand in its demise.
Bernardoni also thinks that it might have just been stolen or given away.
"That's total conjecture. However, UT did have a history of giving items to benefactors as souvenirs," he says.
It's all very much like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" it seems. Of course, it could very well be sitting in some oblivious Texan's home or backyard with not a clue as to its origin.

Since the polls opened Oct. 13, Harris County recorded 951,066 votes and 136,851 mail ballots by Thursday evening, according to Despart.
If the early voting pace continues during Election Day, Harris County will likely break its current record for the election with the highest participation; 1.34 million votes were cast in 2016.
Harris County saw more than 100,000 votes each day during the first four days of early voting. It was one of a few major Texas counties that broke first-day turnout records.
Some voters have been going above and beyond to make it to the polls this year. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins voted from the International Space Station earlier this week, which means she has earned voting bragging rights forever.

More than 127,000 drive-thru votes cast by Harris County voters are now safe and will be counted, after a GOP-led court challenge to toss out drive-thru ballots was rejected by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen on Monday.
Original Story:
In an last-minute effort to stop drive-thru voting, Republicans filed a lawsuit on October 27 seeking to invalidate 127,000 ballots cast through drive-thru voting places in Harris County.
The petition argued that drive-thru voting was not allowed under the Texas Election Code. The GOP challenge was spearheaded by Republican activist Steven Hotze, Wendell Champion, the Honorable Steve Toth and Sharon Hemphill.
"Drive-thru voting is not recognized in the Texas Election Code," the GOP-led petition read. "Hollins' drive-thru voting scheme allows any and all Harris County registered voters--regardless of whether they are permitted to do so under the Texas Election Code--to engage in early and election day 'drive-thru' voting.'"
TRUMP CARAVAN INVESTIGATED: FBI investigating alleged harassment after Trump caravan surrounded Biden campaign bus in Texas
The Texas Supreme Court denied the petition Sunday, while a similar case now awaits in front of Hanen in federal court. The Texas Supreme Court did not issue an opinion on the ruling Sunday.
This move marks the second attempt to shut down drive-thru voting in Harris County in recent weeks to dismantle drive-thru voting in Harris County.
Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins told Chron.com that he was encouraged by the voters' rights victory.
"I'm just happy for 127,000 people," Hollins said.
He also reassured Harris County voters that every drive-thru ballot will count.
"Drive-Thru Voting is a safe, secure and convenient way to vote," Hollins tweeted. 'Texas Election Code allows it, the Secretary of State approved it and 127,000 voters from all walks of life have used it."
In the GOP-led challenge, the petition requests that all memory cards from the 10 drive-thru voting locations "be secured and not entered or downloaded into the Tally machine" until the Supreme Court issues an order.
Drive-thru voting was first created as an option for voters to cast their ballots safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the plan was approved by the Texas Secretary of State's office.
For Harris County voters who haven't cast their ballot in early voting, there are more than 800 voting centers open tomorrow from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and voters can cast their ballot at any of these voting locations.""" ;

<https://www.civilbeat.org/2016/11/who-voted-for-donald-trump-in-hawaii/> dct:description """Donald Trump lost badly to Democrat Hillary Clinton in Hawaii, only pulling in 29.4 percent of votes statewide, but he outperformed previous Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney when they ran against Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.
Trump’s upset win nationally still has many mainland pollsters, pundits and politicos trying to deduce what went wrong in their prognostications.
What’s clear on the national scale is that Trump did well among white male voters, especially those with less than a college education. A recent analysis by The Washington Post said he also received the votes of more white women than expected.
So any analysis of the results circles around the touchy subjects of race and ethnicity. How did that play out in Hawaii, one of the most racially diverse states in the union?
Anthony Quintano/Civil Beat
A Civil Beat analysis of election results and U.S. Census data found that Trump tended to do well in some of the most affluent parts of the state, where many tourist accommodations are located. They include parts of the Princeville and Hanalei area on Kauai; Kapalua, Kaanapali and Wailea on Maui; and the Kailua-Kona area on Hawaii Island.
On Oahu, Trump did best on the Leeward Coast and the North Shore.
“We’re no longer middle-class in Hawaii. Our state is pretty wiped out because nobody really wants to stand up for our taxpayers. We’ve been drained, and our blood gets sucked up by the Democrats.” —Trump supporter Marissa Kerns
Trump did well in districts with lots of white people and in some cases areas with a lot of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, as well as anywhere with a large military presence.
Kimo Sutton, who was a co-director of Trump’s Hawaii campaign, dismissed the notion that white voters propelled his candidate into the presidency as liberal “Kool-Aid” that’s being pushed by mainstream media outlets.
Instead, Sutton said Trump’s anti-establishment message and his promise of a more prosperous economy probably resonated with Hawaii voters, especially given the state’s high cost of living and single-party dominance by Democrats.
“Donald Trump touched a nerve with the people who were voting for him,” Sutton said. “I saw early on that he was an outsider and not an insider, like what we have in all of Hawaii. You have a lot of people who are upset at the present conditions.”
Here’s a map of the precinct-by-precinct results statewide. The white spots have no population, the Hawaii Office of Elections said:
Trump only won a handful of precincts in Hawaii, including on Oahu’s North Shore around Kahuku and Laie. The billionaire also took the tiny “forbidden island” of Niihau, which is populated mostly by Native Hawaiians. In fact, nearly 60 percent of the island’s voters went for Trump, the highest percentage in the state.
On the Big Island, Trump fared decently (almost 38 percent) in the Kailua-Kona area, where there are more whites (60 percent) than Asians Hawaiians other Pacific Islanders. The area is currently represented by Democrat legislators, but has in the past had GOP representation.
Trump pulled about the same percentage of votes in the Ocean View area. State House District 5, which includes Ocean View, Naalehu, Captain Cook, Kealakekua and parts of Kailua-Kona, has a 60 percent white population.
Trump also performed well in Makaha and especially Nanakuli on Oahu’s Leeward Coast and farther east into Kapolei and Makakilo. And he held his own against Clinton in the Ewa area and the neighborhoods on, next to or near Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
The ethnicity is mixed in these areas, but there are many military personnel and their dependents. Hawaii’s veteran population is about 10 percent of the entire voting population and most live on Oahu. State Rep. Bob McDermott, a veteran and Republican, has long represented the greater Ewa area and Iroquois Point.
Marissa Kerns lives in Waianae in a house overlooking the ocean near Pokai Bay. The fervent Trump supporter organized campaign activities in West Oahu and other parts of the island. She even flew to New Hampshire in the waning days of the election to sign-wave and work phone banks.
Kerns is a former small business owner and Filipino immigrant who moved to Hawaii in 1988. Her support for Trump, she said, is largely due to her concern about the economy and a lack of jobs, particularly on Oahu’s west side where census data shows at least one in four people lives below the poverty line.
“We’re no longer middle-class in Hawaii,” Kerns said. “Our state is pretty wiped out because nobody really wants to stand up for our taxpayers. We’ve been drained, and our blood gets sucked up by the Democrats.”
While Kerns said she’s financially secure, she worries about others in her community. When she looks out her window she sees a growing homeless population and families that are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
Like other Trump supporters who want to “drain the swamp,” Kerns has particular disdain for Hawaii’s establishment politicians, most of whom are Democrats. She says they often only work for their own self-interests or those of their friends, who might share cozy relationships with lobbyists and campaign contributors.
There is also an ethnic bent to Kerns’ criticism. She cited the “local Japanese elitists” who she believes are over-represented in Hawaii’s power structures, from the state Capitol to the education system.
She pointed to Gov. David Ige and Department of Education Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi, both of whom are Japanese-American, as examples.
“Our state is run by Japanese,” Kerns said. “We don’t have the diversity.”
Anthony Quintano
Some of Trump’s strongest support came in Precinct 47-03 on Oahu’s North Shore, where he received nearly 51 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 34 percent. It includes Waimea, Pupukea, Kahuku and Laie. Historically, the Mormon church and Brigham Young University have been influential in Laie. This is where Romney, a Mormon, did best in 2012.
The precinct is part of state House District 47, which stretches from Waialua to Kaaawa. The white population is estimated to be more than 57 percent, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders at 41 percent and Asians just below 38 percent. (Race is counted as “alone or in combination,” which explains why the total exceeds 100 percent.)
While Hawaii’s Republican Party has long been in the minority, it has sometimes succeeded in electing state representatives from this region, which encompasses North Shore and Windward Oahu.
Boyd Ready is a landscape contractor and certified arborist who lives on the North Shore. He’s also the secretary for Hawaii’s Republican Party. He said it’s instructive to think of Rust Belt voters (Trump unexpectedly won Pennsylvania and is still expected to win a tight Michigan race) when looking at North Shore Trump support.
He said there are a lot of independent tradesmen and small business owners in the area who don’t have the “safety net” of a week-to-week paycheck or public employees union membership. Their interaction with government agencies tend to be less frequent, and not always pleasant.
“Anybody who’s in that situation tends to be a little more vigilant and unhappy with the complexities of life that are decided upon by the powers that be,” Ready said. “It’s kind of like living in the country, where people go to be independent and a little adventurous. That’s the sort of person that seems to be a little more disinclined by the status quo. Trump is seen as anti-status quo.”
Nathan Paikai is a Native Hawaiian minister and one of the Trump campaign’s most visible supporters as a director of his political campaign here. When Paikai looks at Trump he sees the face of someone who can heal the nation, and whose family values resonated with the people who lived here, particularly along parts of the Leeward Coast where he said there are a lot of evangelicals.
Paikai described Trump and his family as “humble” despite their collective wealth.
Like other Trump backers, Paikai said the media is to blame for taking Trump’s comments on race and ethnicity out of context, such as when he called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals while adding that “some, I assume, are good people.” He also said the allegations lodged against Trump about sexually assaulting women were overblown.
Paikai said Trump spoke to his heart.
“They call me Prophet Nathan,” Paikai said. “That’s a title that God has granted me. And when he asked me, before Mr. Trump decided to run, he spoke to me in the night and said, ‘This is my son Donald. He loves me. I love him. Back him up.’ I said, ‘OK, God. If this is you then make me the leader of the Trump team in Hawaii.'”""" ;

It collapsed into the arena below with a prolonged rumble at 4:19 a.m. The roof collapse was attributed to the weight of accumulated snow and ice from a 10-day storm. Miraculously, no one was hurt because the center was in the midst of an unusual three-day run of basketball games; no crews were inside making the changeover from basketball to hockey. \"I'll just be thanking the Lord that no one died,'' said former Hartford Deputy Mayor Nicholas R. Carbone, the political leader most closely identified with the Civic Center. \"That day when I got to the site and I saw it, I just thanked the Lord that it didn't happen five hours earlier.'' Just 12 hours after the collapse, working off a sketch on an envelope, City Manager James B. Daken announced the coliseum would be rebuilt \"bigger and better.\" The building, now called the XL Center, has operated for more than 30 years since without incident. Building managers point out that the rebuilt center's roof is a railroad bridge truss construction thats much stronger than the original. During the recent run of winter storms, engineers have been engaged to check the roof periodically, and crews have cleared snow from the roof." ;

<https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/feds-looking-at-ways-to-tackle-wave-of-gun-violence-in-toronto-minister-1.4024003> dct:description """OTTAWA - The new federal minister responsible for tackling gun violence says he has been in touch with Toronto's mayor and police chief to discuss Sunday's deadly shooting in the city and how Ottawa can support efforts to stop a growing wave of incidents rattling Torontonians.
Bill Blair, minister of border security and organized crime reduction, made the comments on Twitter as other federal politicians tweeted their thoughts and support to victims of the shooting in Toronto's Greektown area.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the shooting as a terrible tragedy, but added that the people of Toronto are strong, resilient and brave, and Canadians will be there to support them at this difficult time.
NDP leader Jagmeet Singh says his heart goes out to all those affected by the shooting, including emergency personnel who were the first to respond.
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, whose department has been overseeing a federal program aimed at reducing guns and gangs in Canada, similarly thanked first responders for their work and said he had been in touch with Toronto's mayor but didn't offer further details.
Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin, member for the area where the shooting occurred, says she is shocked and saddened by the tragedy and has contacted police for more information.

Brian Isaack Clyde, who was killed Monday after firing shots into the Earle Cabell Federal Building in downtown Dallas, shared several "involuntary celibate," or incel, memes in his social media accounts.
That connection, according to the Air Force Times, inspired the brass at Joint Base Andrews to initiate a program alerting airmen to signs that someone might belong to the online incel community — men who can't find romantic partners and who sometimes react violently because of it.
Clyde, 22, shared memes prevalent in the incel community in some of his social media posts, including one that referred to a "Chad rampage" vs. a "virgin shooting." The Chad vs. virgin trope is a common incel meme.""" ;

ABOUT INTERNATIONAL DANCE MUSIC AWARDS
Running concurrently with Winter Music Conference in Miami, FL (March 25-28 in the spectacular Faena District), the IDMAs generate over two million votes annually from music enthusiasts in 209 countries and territories to recognize and honor exceptional achievements in various award categories.
ABOUT WINTER MUSIC CONFERENCE
2019 marks the first fully-programmed WMC since it was announced in March 2018 that the organizers behind Ultra Worldwide, the world’s most successful independent, international music festival brand, had acquired the Winter Music Conference (founded in 1985) and International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) properties. The Ultra Worldwide acquisition aims to restore WMCâ€™s status as the must-attend dance music industry and networking conference in the world. A property unlike any other, WMCâ€™s exclusive hotel partner, The Faena, was named by Conde Nast Traveler as the #1 hotel in Miami Beach for two consecutive years (2017 & 2018) via their prestigious readers poll.""" ;

<https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/1/29/21112311/hillary-clinton-poll-president-donald-trump-impeachment-joe-biden-better-worse> dct:description """SALT LAKE CITY — Would things be better in the country if Hillary Clinton were president?
Utahns don’t think so.
Even though voters in the decidedly red state didn’t embrace Donald Trump in 2016, they seem to be warming somewhat to the president, even as he faces possible removal from office after being impeached.
Utahns would choose the president over the top Democratic contenders, though Trump doesn’t reach a majority in any of those potential races.
A new Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows 53% of Utah residents say the United States would be worse off if Clinton occupied the White House instead of Trump. Only 24% say the country would be better, while 13% don’t think things would be much different.
And you don’t even have to ask Trump what he thinks. He’ll tell you whether you want to know or not, tweeting this week: “Are you better off now than you were three years ago? Almost everyone says YES!”
Clinton was in Park City last week for the premiere of the documentary “Hillary,” in which she says losing to Trump “made me sick to my stomach.”
During a question-and-answer session at the Sundance Film Festival, Clinton said the next president has a lot of domestic problems to address as well as serious problems around the world because of the way Trump has conducted himself.
Approval rating
A slight majority of Utahns, though, have a favorable view of the president.
Trump gets a 53% percent approval rating from Utahns — 27% strongly approve and 26% somewhat approve of the job he is doing. On the flip side, 44% disapprove, including 30% strongly, according to the poll.
“Utahns are divided on President Trump but they’re not divided at all on Hillary Clinton,” said Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute at the University of Utah. He noted the percentage of residents who approve of Trump and say things would be worse with Clinton are the same.
Pollster Scott Rasmussen surveyed 1,017 Utah registered voters Jan. 15-22. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Though Perry said it’s a bit of surprise that Trump’s approval rating is up, Utahns have remained consistent about Clinton.
Impeachment, he said, doesn’t appear to be having an impact. The more it’s perceived as a political process as opposed to getting at the truth, the more it plays in Trump’s favor, Perry said.
A booming economy, low unemployment and falling gas prices in the state also might play into residents’ feelings about how things are going in the country.
“People do vote with their 401Ks and they do pay attention to who they think will be able to best allow them to provide for their families. Hillary Clinton did not claim that message, President Trump did,” Perry said, adding people continue to believe the economy is better under Trump than it would have been with Clinton.
Utahns also are generally pleased with Trump’s two appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Charles Stormont isn’t among those who think the country is better with Trump at the helm, though he concedes Clinton has flaws and wouldn’t be a perfect president.
“The current president has tried to transform the executive branch into a kingship,” said the Democratic national committeeman and one-time Utah attorney general candidate.
Trump, he said, has injected politics into judicial appointments and is on trial for abusing his power.
“It just highlights that he’s really undermined faith and confidence in our form of government,” Stormont said. “When somebody goes to work every day and tries to bring down the institutions of government that our entire society is built around, it sure seems like we would be better off with anybody else in that position.”
Derek Brown, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, said things are better in the country with Trump by any objective measure, listing record low unemployment, foreign affairs and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, among others.
“He is doing what he said he’d do,” Brown said.
Brown said he was able to see how Trump’s mind works when the president dropped in on a recent Republican National Committee meeting he attended in Florida.
“He knows what he’s doing, but sometimes he makes it look like he’s freewheeling,” he said. “But I think there’s a clear line of sight from where we are to where he wants to take us, and the results of that are what people are seeing now.”
Naturally, Trump does well among Republicans in the state with 76% approving of his performance, while 83% of Democrats disapprove, according to the poll.
A Salt Lake Chamber poll last August showed Utahns more evenly split over their impression of the president, with 48% saying they view Trump favorably and 49% not favorably. That survey also found a majority of residents believe one term in office is enough for Trump.
Candidate matchups
When matched head to head against the top six Democratic presidential candidates in the Deseret News/Hinckley Institute poll, Trump bests them all, though he only wins with 50% over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Michael Bloomberg fares best against the president with 32% of Utahns saying they would vote for the billionaire and former New York City mayor. Trump gets 45% in that scenario.
Part of the reason Bloomberg might have done better than the other candidates is because he is trying to take the economic argument back for the Democrats, Perry said. It’s an issue Utahns are looking for and Bloomberg knows the economy, he said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden pulls 31% in a race with Trump as does Sanders, with Warren getting 28%, Pete Buttigieg, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 25% and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., only 23%, the survey shows.
Based on the results of those ballot matchups, 40% of Utah voters always picked Trump and 7% usually backed Trump. Another 24% always or usually picked the Democratic candidate. Those who always picked Trump jumps to 49% among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while it drops to 33% with Catholics.
Perry said it’s key for the candidates to go after and capture voters in the middle.
Trump won Utah in 2016 with just 45.5% of the vote, his lowest margin of victory in any of the states he captured. Utah has voted for a Republican for president since 1964.""" ;

<https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/10/22/21528825/news-poll-utahns-concerned-election-results-being-accepted-by-trump-biden-hinckley> dct:description """SALT LAKE CITY — President Donald Trump continues to hold a double-digit lead in Utah over his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, in new polling released Thursday that also found an overwhelming majority of likely voters are concerned the election results won’t be accepted by the candidates.
Half of the likely Utah voters in the latest Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll say Trump is their pick for president, compared to 38% who choose Biden. Another 3% back Libertarian Jo Jorgensen for president; 1%, unspecified other candidates; and 7% aren’t sure.
But reminded that Trump has said repeatedly he may not go along with the outcome of the Nov. 3 election, 80% of likely voters said they have some level of concern that one of the presidential candidates won’t accept the results — 62% either are very or somewhat concerned while another 18% said they are not very concerned.
Only 16% said they’re not at all concerned about the peaceful transfer of power after the election and 4% aren’t sure.
Still, a majority of Utahns view the president favorably, 52%, compared to 38% in the Beehive State who have a favorable opinion of Biden. And Trump’s job approval is at 55%, down just a single percentage point from last month.
The poll for the Deseret News and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics was conducted Oct. 12-17 of 1,000 likely Utah voters by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Rasmussen said the concern expressed about what happens after the election hasn’t impacted Trump’s support in Utah.
“I think it’s safe to say the electoral votes in Utah safely remain in the president’s column,” the pollster said, even though in September, Trump led Biden 53% to 35%, a 3 percentage point loss for the president and a 3 percentage point gain for his Democratic opponent.
“It is interesting his margin is down a little bit. It’s hard to know if that’s just statistical noise, or whether maybe it’s a reflection of the last (presidential) debate and testing positive” for COVID-19, Rasmussen said of the president’s standing in Utah. “But still, a 12-point margin is pretty decent.”
Trump recently backtracked after declining several times to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses his reelection bid. But the president has continued to claim there will be widespread election fraud because of a national shift during the coronavirus pandemic to voting by mail, something Utah has done successfully for years.
“To be honest, he hasn’t done the best job of clarifying the issue,” Rasmussen said, adding Trump’s lack of a “clear statement” about how he’ll react if he loses has increased voters’ discomfort. “Most people in America, and certainly most of Utah, have a sense of fairness. Results come in and win or lose, you take what you get.”
He said the concern measured in the poll partly reflects the president’s comments but more broadly, “a concern that the political system itself is a little bit dysfunctional.” Although Trump has been the focus of that concern, Rasmussen said a “lot of people on the right say they are not convinced Biden will concede gracefully, either.”
In August, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee who lost to Trump, said Biden “should not concede under any circumstances, because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually I do believe he will win if we don’t give an inch, and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.”
Because of delays in counting absentee ballots, it could be some time before the winner is known. Even then, there is an expectation of a repeat of the legal battle that ensued over the Florida vote count in the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore that ended in the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We could end up in a very tense situation,” Rasmussen said.
Hinckley Institute Director Jason Perry said the question of voter concern about the election results being accepted is timely because “so many people are talking about it. It shows that this is more than just talk about this possibility. Both sides are expecting there to be lawsuits or contention about the final outcome.”
Perry pointed out a whopping 94% of Democrats in the poll are very or somewhat concerned, along with 70% of unaffiliated or third-party voters and 46% of Republicans — numbers that reflect what he said is an unfounded concern that the president won’t give up the office if he fails to secure a second term.
“It’s a narrative that is motivating to voters,” he said. “I don’t believe anyone really thinks if President Trump loses he will not step out of the White House. ... This is not how our country works.”
The Hinckley Institute director said while that fear may be driving people to the polls now, that could end up having a reverse effect.
“The bottom line is the allegations are thrown out enough and repeated enough that voters have at least in their mind, a concern about the legitimacy. My hope is that does not keep people from participating because the strategy could backfire as well,” Perry said.
Scott Howell, a former Democratic Utah Senate leader and a key surrogate for Biden in Utah, said he sees a “major disconnect” between the level of concern raised and Trump’s support in the state. He said the heightened worry over the election results being accepted could translate into voters taking another look at Biden.
“When you talk about a transition of power, it has always been orderly. It has always been without any type of what I’d call military intervention or things that you see in other countries, assassinations and all that,” Howell said, “The president has said time and time again that he’s not ready to accept what could happen.”
He said that’s not the case with the former vice president.
“If Joe loses, he will lose it with honor and dignity and he will move on and try to continue to contribute,” Howell said, adding he’s never heard from the campaign that Biden wouldn’t concede once all the ballots are counted. “Knowing Joe the way I know him, he’s just going to be gracious.”
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, a co-chairman of Trump’s reelection campaign in Utah, said voters in the state are anxious about what they anticipate will be a tight race.
“I think anytime there’s a close election, whether it’s local or national, there’s probably concern over how it’s going to roll out after the effect,” Adams said. “I think it shows people really engaged in the election. It’s not a bad thing, OK, the fact that they’re engaged enough to be concerned.”
Trump is focused on the accuracy of the vote, he said, not on staying put if he doesn’t win.
“When he speaks boldly, he can be misunderstood. His intent can be misunderstood. But I do believe that he’s probably rightfully concerned” about making sure the “results are tabulated properly,” Adams said. “He’s been very assertive about it and I think, in his way, he’s raised concerns about it. But I also believe, and I’ve always felt that he would transition if the results were obvious and conclusive.”""" ;

Just over half of Utahns, 51%, said they would vote to reelect the Republican president, compared to 32% who would cast their ballot for Biden. The poll was conducted April 15-21 by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen of 964 registered Utah voters and has a margin or error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
The same poll found 57% of Utahns approve of the job Trump is doing, a number that is unchanged from March.
Jason Perry, director of the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics, said the poll results show that Utahns not only approve of how the president is handling the COVID-19 outbreak, they see him as best-equipped to handle the economic fallout from the deadly virus.
“For right now, he is still owning the economic argument, that he is the one who is going to be able to bring the United States out of the economic state that it’s in right now,” Perry said. “It looks like he is poised still to win reelection in Utah. ... The reality is that people do tend to vote with the 401(k)s and their wallets.”
Biden could see a boost in his Utah numbers from his vice presidential pick, Perry said, particularly if he adds a moderate seen as strong on economic issues to the Democratic ticket. The former vice president has said he will choose a woman as his running mate but has not been more specific.
Perry noted that in Utah’s 4th Congressional District, seen as the state’s most competitive, Biden does slightly better and Trump, slightly worse, with 46% of voters saying they’re for the Republican and 38%, for the Democrat, in the presidential race.
Those results are good news for Rep. Ben McAdams, Utah’s only Democrat in Congress, Perry said, since they underscore that he’s running for reelection in a district “where there is a segment of the population that will move and is not as set for Donald Trump.”
Trump won Utah, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, with just 45.5% of the vote in 2016. That was his lowest margin of victory in any state that he won in the last presidential election. He also came in third in Utah’s 2016 GOP presidential caucus vote, trailing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
But the president easily won Utah’s Super Tuesday Republican presidential primary March 3 with nearly 88% of the vote. Biden came in second in Utah’s Democratic presidential primary behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, ending up with just over 18% of the vote.
Longtime Utah Trump supporter Don Peay said he expects the president to win big in Utah in November “if there is a reasonable outcome to COVID and a reboot of the economy.” Peay joked that the only chance Biden has to declare victory in Utah is if the former vice president confuses the state with Colorado.
He said the list of reasons Trump is leading with Utah voters is long, including that he “rebuilt” the economy, in part by rolling “back the ‘elite globalists’ in the Republican Party who sold out our manufacturing and energy,” and added two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Biden surrogate Scott Howell, a former state Senate minority leader, said he sees the results as positive given that the pandemic has halted traditional campaigning and forced Biden to reach out to voters from his Delaware home that now includes a TV studio in the basement while Trump holds daily White House briefings on the virus.
“I think to get a third of the vote in the circumstances that we’re in is remarkable. Because one candidate has a free forum every day for up to 2, 2 1⁄ 2 hours and the other candidate is stuck down in his basement,” Howell said.
Perry said it’s telling that only 9% of Utahns said they were unsure of their choice in the upcoming president election. Another 8% said they favored another, unnamed candidate.
“This poll was conducted during the time when the economy was taking a dive and people were talking about who should have done what, when. Those are questions that will continue to go forward,” he said. “But for right now, President Trump is not taking the blame, the full blame.”""" ;

The survey also shows a majority of the state’s voters like the job he’s doing, including his handling of the pandemic.
Half of the registered voters polled for the Deseret News and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics said they would vote for Trump if the November election were held today, compared to 31% who would go with Biden. Only 11% said they are unsure who they’d choose.
At the same time, 55% approve of the president’s job performance, while 42% disapprove. When it comes to Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Utahns were slightly less supportive, with 52% expressing approval and 45% disapproval.
The statewide poll was conducted July 27-Aug. 1 of 1,000 registered Utah voters by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. It comes as Trump lags behind Biden, 42.7% to 49.1% in the Real Clear Politics average of top national polls.
“The reality is, Utahns are not unsure of how they feel about President Trump,” Hinckley Institute Director Jason Perry said, pointing out the president has been able to maintain a core of support since the beginning of the year, with his approval ratings hitting a high of 57% in March and April before dipping to a low of 52% in May.
Still, Perry said, those numbers shouldn’t be seen as set in stone.
“Things may change. There are so many uncertainties. President Trump should not take that base for granted,” he said, adding that Trump’s showing, while stable, should be stronger given Utah’s status as one of the most Republican states in the nation.
“You would expect a Republican president to be polling better,” Perry said.
Utah has not voted for a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, but Trump finished a distant third in the state’s 2016 GOP caucus and ended up with just over 45% of the vote in the state four years ago, his lowest margin of victory in any of the states he won.
Longtime Utah Trump supporter Don Peay said he expects Trump to do much better in the state this November and called getting the support of 50% of voters in the poll “amazing” given all the unrest currently in the country, centered around police brutality against Blacks.
“The commonsense people are looking at the absolute stupidity of the Democratic Party, with destruction of property, trampling freedom, burning down cities, crime,” Peay said, describing Trump as a “rough and tumble guy” and Biden as “hiding out in a basement somewhere with a mask on.”
Instead of protests, he said the president is focused on the pandemic, “on the frontlines fighting every single day to try to overcome one of the hardest things in the history of our lifetime and he’s winning. The people see that. The people of Utah are obviously smart, they’re common sense, they’re pragmatic.”
Scott Howell, a former Democratic leader in the Utah Senate, said the poll results mean Biden supporters like himself have work to do. But Howell said he’s hearing dissatisfaction even among Republicans about how Trump is dealing with the virus.
“It’s surprising to me,” Howell said of Trump’s lead in Utah, given Biden’s strength in national polling, as well as a number of swing states. “Coronavirus has realigned voters’ concerns and behavior countrywide and it’s interesting to me that same trend isn’t happening here in the state of Utah.”

Mitt Romney’s willingness to challenge the president on a range of issues “is opening a pathway” for Biden, Howell said, giving the former vice president “the opportunity to keep staying on the positive about the handling of the pandemic and what he would do versus what (the president) has done.”
Trump doesn’t do quite as well in the poll in the 4th Congressional District, where the state’s only Democrat in Congress, Rep. Ben McAdams, faces a tough race against Republican Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and frequent Fox News guest.
But Trump still beats Biden 45% to 35% among registered voters in the 4th District, which includes portions of Salt Lake and Utah counties, according to the poll, which also found 51% of voters there approve of the president’s job performance compared to 47% who disapprove.
However, voters in the state’s most competitive congressional district are evenly split, 49%-49% over Trump’s efforts against the deadly virus, For the 4th District results, 800 registered voters were polled and the margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Numbers from the same poll released earlier this week showed McAdams and Owens are tied, 35%-35%, among 4th District voters.
Perry said Trump’s standing in the district could make the difference in a race likely to be decided by independent and moderate voters, enough of whom went for McAdams in 2018 over two-term Republican Rep. Mia Love to give him a victory of less than 700 votes.
“Burgess Owens is going to have to do more than just align himself with President Trump to be successful in that district,” the Hinckley Institute director said. “The positive point for Congressman McAdams is he is in a district where it’s not just going to fall along political lines.”
Peay, who helped bring the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., to Utah last month to raise more than $100,000 for Owens, said Love “made a terrible mistake” by rejecting Trump’s campaign help two years ago in her race against the then-Salt Lake County mayor.
Even before her race was called, Love, now a CNN contributor, was mocked by Trump at a news conference after the election where he called out unsuccessful midterm Republican candidates who’d turned down his offers of assistance.
“But Mia Love gave me no love,” the president said. “She lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.”
However, don’t look for Trump Sr. to make a stop in Utah for Owens, Peay said.
“He doesn’t need to come. Burgess is going to run a strong race and his message resonates,” he said, adding that he expects Owens to align his “strong views” with voters. “I think the president is going to be focused on some other states and doesn’t need to come to Utah.”
Owens’ campaign spokesman, Jesse Ranney, said there’s been “no negative feedback” about Trump’s backing.
“Burgess is running his own campaign,” Ranney said. “I don’t think it’s had much of an impact. Burgess is honest to his core. He’s not going to shy away from what he believes or who he supports. Poll numbers aren’t going to change his opinion.”
Howell said he believes the 4th District could go for Biden, as voters see what he does in the Democratic candidate. “I know what he stands for. I know his moral character. I know his moral compass and it is not the same as the president’s today,” he said.
A Biden victory in the 4th District would be a boost to McAdams, who is relying on the same independent and moderate Republican voters who could help shift Utah from reliably Republican red to swing state purple in November.
McAdams’ campaign manager, Andrew Roberts, downplayed the poll results.
“Ben is focused on the next round of health and economic relief for Utah families and small businesses,” Roberts said. “Political polls aren’t top of mind when people are worried about their kids’ schooling, virus protection and getting back to work.”""" ;

<https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/100-years-after-ore-boat-disappeared-lake-superior-storm-searchers-locate-wreck-2> dct:description """Just a few months shy of 100 years after it sank with all hands in a monstrous November storm, it appears that the freighter Henry B. Smith -- one of the most sought-after lost wrecks of Lake Superior -- has been found.
A group of shipwreck hunters with Northland ties has found a previously undiscovered wreck sitting largely intact amid a spilled load of iron ore in about 535 feet of water offshore from Marquette, Mich., and all evidence points to it being the Smith. Until last month, the 525-foot vessel had not been seen since it and its crew of 25 inadvertently sailed into the brunt of the Great Lakes Storm of 1913.
"It's the most satisfying find of my shipwreck-hunting career," said Jerry Eliason of Cloquet, part of the group that has located a number of lost ships in recent years, though perhaps none as significant as the Smith.
"It's a fantastic find," said maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse of Marquette, who has written about the long-lost ship. "I'm excited at the opportunity to look at the video and see if we can learn the cause of the wreck, to write the final chapter of the ship."
The wreck
The Henry B. Smith was launched in 1906; its christening in Lorain, Ohio, on May 2 was reported in the next day's Duluth News Tribune.
By 1913, "she had the reputation of being one of the staunchest steel ships on the lakes, and relatively new," Stonehouse said.
That November brought one of the biggest storms recorded on the Great Lakes -- one that would end up being by far the most destructive in terms of ships and lives lost, Stonehouse said. More than a dozen ships sank, and about 250 sailors died.
But as the storm picked up steam on Nov. 7 and 8, the Henry B. Smith was safe in the harbor at Marquette, taking on a load of iron ore. On the evening of Nov. 9, with loading complete, Captain James Owen decided to leave port, bound for Cleveland -- even as other ships remained in the safety of the harbor.
"The lake was still rolling, but there seemed to be a lull in the wind, the velocity having dropped to 32 mph," Duluth native, shipwreck expert and longtime University of Minnesota Duluth professor Julius Wolff wrote in "Lake Superior Shipwrecks." "The gale already had hit the Soo with winds more than 50 mph for 36 hours and should have blown itself out. But, this was no conventional storm. In taking his vessel out of the safety of Marquette Harbor, Captain James Owen sailed into eternity."
Sailors on other boats reported seeing deckhands on the Smith still battening down hatches as it went onto the open lake, Stonehouse recounts in his book "Went Missing." Other witnesses watched the ship make a turn to port, as if Captain Owen had found the storm too strong and decided to head for the lee of the Keweenaw Peninsula.
Then the Smith and its crew of 25 vanished into the maelstrom, and entered Great Lakes lore as a "ghost ship."
Few clues
With many other ships sunk or in peril, and communications still primitive by today's standards, it was several days before the Smith's absence drew widespread concern.
Unidentified wreckage started washing ashore in the Marquette area, Stonehouse writes in "Went Missing," and on Nov. 14 a local man reported finding an oar marked "Henry B. Smith" and other debris along the beaches east of Marquette. Over the following days, more debris traced to the Smith turned up farther east, toward Munising.
Then on Nov. 21, a passing steamer recovered the body of the Smith's second cook wearing a life belt, 50 miles west of Whitefish Point. It was one of only two bodies recovered of the crew of 25, Stonehouse reports. The second, that of the ship's third engineer, was found on Michipicoten Island the following May.
In June 1914, papers around Lake Superior -- including the News Tribune -- carried news of a sensational find: A message in a bottle, purportedly from the lost Smith, describing the ship breaking in two 12 miles east of Marquette.
"However, as the note was dated November 12 and the Smith had sailed on the 9th, presumably sinking that night, the authenticity of the find was doubted," Wolff wrote.
Lake Superior would reveal no more clues to the ship's fate.
Discovery
So how did the hunters find the Henry B. Smith with few clues amid the vast waters of Lake Superior?
Eliason is cagey about that, because he hopes to locate other lost wrecks using the same method and doesn't want to tip his hand just yet. But it wasn't a case of just taking a sonar unit out on the lake and spending days "mowing the lawn" -- running a grid pattern over a large search area, hoping to turn up something. This time, the group pinpointed a very specific area to search, Eliason said, and in fact located the Smith just 20 minutes after dropping the sonar unit into the water.
It was the culmination of years of hunches, research and repeated information requests to obscure government agencies and archives -- work that finally paid off with the acquisition of a veritable mountain of raw data.
Eliason's wife, Karen, a software engineer, played a key role in interpreting that information.
"My son says I'm a shipwreck savant and my wife is a computer savant," Jerry Eliason said. "It was a matter of processing the data, writing the formulas."
"It was fun because we were doing something together, and the topic was very interesting," Karen Eliason said. "This was a really sweet one."
The data-processing pointed them toward a possible wreck about 30 miles north of Marquette.
"I thought, 'That's kind of in the same part of the world where the Henry Smith went down," Jerry Eliason said.
So on May 24 he, along with fellow shipwreck hunters Kraig Smith of Rice Lake, Wis., and Ken Merryman of Minneapolis, headed out on the lake. Using a sonar unit developed by Eliason's son, Jarrod, they quickly pinpointed the target wreck and dropped down an underwater camera.
That day and the next, with wreck-hunter Dan Fountain of Marquette joining in to help muscle the camera and its 500-foot tether, the photos and video captured enough details to convince the group that the ship is the Smith -- though it did not capture the name on the side of the ship, something the group plans to try for on a return trip later this summer.
But the wreck's location, its size, the iron ore cargo and details they were able to spot on camera -- such as a unique "flying bridge" atop the pilothouse -- leave no doubt in the minds of the wreck hunters and Stonehouse that it's the Henry B. Smith.
"While we still don't have absolute proof it's the Henry B. Smith, it's the only (lost) ship in the area of that size that had iron ore," said Merryman, who like the others in the group has decades of experience searching for Lake Superior wrecks. Stonehouse also said the Smith is the only missing wreck that would match the location and other evidence.
While a lot of work went into identifying the search location, the relative ease in locating the wreck once out on the lake was a big departure from past finds.
"A number of wrecks we've found have been over the span of 20 years searching, multiple times a year," Kraig Smith said. "Going and finding a wreck 20-some miles offshore in the span of a couple hours is extraordinary."
What now?
Now that the Smith has been found, there is work to be done. Finding the wreck "asks more questions than it answers," Stonehouse said.
"(The shipwreck hunters) climbed Mount Everest" in finding the wreck, he said. "Now you have to see what you can see from there."
First up is returning to the site this summer to further document the wreck with underwater cameras on long cables from the surface; the ship's depth puts it out of reach of divers without extremely specialized -- and expensive -- technology.
It appears that the ship is broken in the middle, Merryman said, with the forward part listing a bit but very intact.
"It's a beautiful wreck" with great visibility, he said. "No zebra mussels; clean."
The stern has more damage, Merryman said. Perhaps a boiler exploded, or pressure built up during the sinking burst out.
More time at the wreck should answer many questions, but the shipwreck hunters are starting to piece together possible scenarios for the Smith's demise.
"It's very clear to me that this one appeared to have broken on the surface, spilled its iron ore contents over the bottom, and then landed on the iron ore," Eliason said.
The group already appears to have firmly debunked that dubious message in a bottle, which placed the Smith in a very different location.
Eliason said he'd been considering retiring from wreck hunting, given the enormous time and effort it requires. He wasn't expecting to come up with more significant finds on Lake Superior.
"This was a gift from the lake gods," Eliason said.
Merryman said that as the group left port last month, he had a feeling something special was in the making.
"When things need to happen, they happen," he said. "It's the 100th anniversary. This would be a great memorial, a commemoration of all the people who died in the storm.\"""" ;

Today during the live stream of the festivities on Day 1 of Ultra Miami and fabled brand let viewers get a sneak peek of what is to come in 2017 for the world's largest dance music festival. While Ultra Music Festival India has been rumored and in the works for some time it is not official.
Ultra Music Festival India Making Two Stops in New Delhi and Mumbai
Not only is Ultra Music Festival India taking place in 2017, the festival is taking place IN TWO CITIES. While no dates have yet been announced this is gigantic News for the two (out of the three) most populous cities in the subcontinent. Check out the screenshot of the live stream below which shows the cities.
The two cities join a harrowed list of some of the most successful Ultra stops in the world. India is known for being a massive consumer of electronic dance music and culture so it is only right that the country gets not one, but two Ultra Music Festivals. This also means that Ultra is very serious about continuing to expand it's brand. Only a decade ago only one Ultra existed and now slowly over the course of many years there are 24 different Ultra Music Festivals all over the globe.
Ultra Music Festival India will no doubt be two entirely unique experiences that are an absolute must for any and all international dance music fan. We are not only excited to learn more about what the festival plans to do as they release details about the two new festivals, but are also incredibly excited to see the reaction of Indian fans. The local talent in India has been noted over the years as the country is a breeding ground for euphoric high energy trance. We can only hope that Ultra India gives proper credit to the genre during its initial events.""" ;

<https://www.escxtra.com/2018/12/29/bosnia-2020-eurovision-difficult/> dct:description """Bosnia & Herzegovina’s Eurovision head of delegation has revealed that broadcaster BHRT’s “primary goal” is to return to the Eurovision Song Contest. Nevertheless, continued “poor financial management” at the Bosnian broadcaster suggests a return to the contest in 2020 looks “difficult”.
Desire to return to “great music competition”
In comments published by Bosnian media outlet klix .ba, BHRT’s Eurovision head of delegation, Lejla BaboviÄ‡, explains that is it the “primary goal” for BHRT to return to “this great music competition” and join with the “European family of musicians”. Unfortunately, it seems a return is far from imminent. Indeed, a return in 2020 seems “difficult”.
The return of Bosnia & Herzegovina to Eurovision depends mainly on finance. For example, it depends on how BHRT operates and whether they will be able to pay back their debts to the EBU. When we find the money and start to pay off debt, then we can talk with the EBU about a possible return to Eurovision. So at best we can be back in 2020, but due to the fact that BHRT is still in trouble and that very few people Â have paid any fees, it will be difficult to go. Lejla BaboviÄ‡
Changes needed to Bosnian legislation
In order to clear these debts, BaboviÄ‡ suggests that changes to Bosnian law regarding public broadcasting funding and budgets must be considered:
The situation is clear, Bosnia & Herzegovina returns to the Eurovision Song Contest when debts are resolved and when they resolve the issue of funding public services in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since June 2016, the law has not resolved the issue of financing. Therefore, the broadcasting service must first find a model of an efficient collection of media fees, which could at some point result in positive and profitable business and, therefore, the inclusion of Eurovision Song Contest in the annual plans. Lejla BaboviÄ‡
300,000 euros needed to be “competitive”
Additionally, BaboviÄ‡ estimates the need for between 250,000 and 300,000 euros in order to participate at the Eurovision Song Contest at a “competitive” level. The current financial situation at BHRT makes such funding “impossible”, with no other companies willing to sponsor participation:
Successful businesses and companies have no great interest to support sending a Bosnia & Herzegovinian entry to Eurovision. I have to admit that the full burden of sending Bosnia & Herzegovina to previous Eurovision Song Contests hit BHRT and I think it is needless to say that we are not able to take part at the moment due to the extremely poor financial operations. Also, BHRT is under sanctions by the EBU because of debt amounting to six million Swiss francs. Lejla BaboviÄ‡
A successful 25 years

<https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a34618833/democrats-win-native-american-communities-2020/> dct:description """Let us allow the soon-to-be-ex-president* and his followers have their cloud cuckoo land all to themselves for a couple of days. There are lovely little rainbows over the landscape elsewhere. The most glorious one is the simple fact that the demographic groups that have the most reasons to hate the government for its empty rhetoric and broken promises—Black Americans and Native Americans—turned out like champions in a result that ought to shame the rest of us. That goes from the high-profile organizers all the way down to the door-knockers, phone-callers, envelope-stuffers, and election observers.
Stacey Abrams is a power who now may well have the fate of the Senate in her hands. Congresswomen Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids, whose embrace on the floor of the House in 2019 still moves me when I think about it, both won re-election to the House. (Republican Yvette Harrell won a seat from New Mexico, too.) Indigenous voters very likely were a big part of Joe Biden's margin of victory in both Arizona and Wisconsin. From the High Country News:
Indigenous people in Arizona comprise nearly 6% of the population — 424,955 people as of 2018 — and eligible voters on the Navajo Nation alone number around 67,000. Currently, the margin between Democratic candidate Joe Biden — who has released a robust policy plan for Indian Country — and incumbent President Donald Trump is just under 41,000 as of Friday morning...
...In Montana, though the state went for Trump overall, counties overlapping with the reservations of the Blackfeet Nation, Fort Belknap Tribes, the Crow Tribe and Northern Cheyenne Tribe went blue. The divides were often stark; Glacier County, encompassed by the Blackfeet Nation, went for Biden by 64%, the highest in the entire state, while the neighboring county voted for Trump by 75%. The Native vote in Montana has made the difference before, when Indigenous voters helped Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat who has advocated for Indian Country in legislation regarding water settlements, missing and murdered Indigenous women, and tribal recognition, get elected the last three terms in often-close races.
Wisconsin, a closely watched swing state, went narrowly for Biden by fewer than 21,000 votes as of Friday morning. There, the Indigenous population is 90,189 people as of 2018. Wisconsin counties overlapping the lands of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Menominee Tribe and the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans show that voters there helped tip the count to a Democratic majority. Menominee County, which overlaps the Menominee Tribe’s reservation, voted for Biden 82%, compared to the state as a whole at 49.4%.
Sharice Davids was also victorious. Bill Clark Getty Images
South Dakota went for Trump by 61% — except on tribal lands. Counties overlapping the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes went for Biden. In Oglala Lakota County, which overlaps with the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s Pine Ridge reservation, Biden won with 88%. In Todd County, which overlaps the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, Biden won 77% of the vote.
It's easy for a lot of us to have faith in The System. These are people with every reason in the world not to have any faith at all, and they turned out to vote for a new president and, in local races, to elect more of their own. There's something very John Lewis about all this. From The Guardian:
In Kansas, Stephanie Byers, who is Chickasaw and a retired teacher, became the state’s first transgender lawmaker when she won her race for a seat in its house of representatives. “We’ve made history here,” Byers said on Tuesday. “We’ve done something in Kansas most people thought would never happen, and we did it with really no pushback, by just focusing on the issues.” Also in Kansas, Christina Haswood, a Navajo Nation member, became the youngest person in the state legislature at 26. A third member of the Kansas house , Ponka-We Victors, a Tohono O’odham and Ponca member, won her re-election campaign.
Let's stay in Kansas for a minute. Riley County was established in 1855 on land west and a little north of Kansas City. It was a railroad town; the most important city was named Manhattan in order to curry favor with a financier in New York. Two years later, Manhattan was established as the county seat, but not until after a nasty fight over election fraud. The establishment of Fort Riley, General Custer's home ballpark, helped the county grow, as did the establishment of Kansas State University in Manhattan. While Democrats across Kansas were having a bad night, especially considering the gains they made in 2018, by 50.1 to 46.8, Riley County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time ever.
Florida voted for a $15 minimum wage. The "war" on drugs was rolled back in Oregon, South Dakota, New Jersey, and Montana. An elected judiciary still is the second-worst idea in American politics, but the Democrats did flip the Michigan Supreme Court. Now, down-ballot was every bit the landfill that people are saying it is; the redistricting process in 2020 is going to be gerrymandered from hell to breakfast. But there are rainbows and some of them are our fellow citizens.

With popular DJs including Tiesto, Avicii, Calvin Harris , Kaskade, David Guetta and plenty others commanding performance fees in the tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars (per performance), radio airplay on traditional pop stations and an increasing number of collaborations with artists in other genres, EDM has become a favorite type of music on the airwaves and at public performances. And a favorite yearly event among fans of EDM is Miami, Florida-based Ultra Music Festival, which is a part of UMF Worldwide.
For the first time since Ultra Music Festival's inception (in 1999), the festival captured the city of Miami for two weekends, ensuring the deprivation of sleep for many Miami residents, but also providing a form of entertainment unrivaled around much of the world. In 2013, Ultra Music Festival set a new attendance record with roughly 330,000 people from more than 80 countries gathering to celebrate the festival's 15 year anniversary and listen to the music they crave. Packing hundreds of thousands of people into 32-acre Bayfront Park in downtown Miami is no small feat. It is also not easy to book the immensely popular (and expensive) talent to perform for the interested guests. That is where Adam Russakoff, a New York licensed attorney and the Executive Producer, Director of Business Affairs and Talent Buyer for Ultra Music Festival and UMF Worldwide, saves the day.
While Russakoff loved the Contracts class he took in law school, he knew since the first time he set foot on a law school campus that he never wanted to practice law. After passing on an opportunity to work with a big festival in New York, he graduated with his Juris Doctor degree and went to work for a dot-com company in Miami. It was not until 2005 that Russakoff met Russell Faibisch and became Faibisch's partner at UMF Worldwide.
"The first thing we did was we brought Ultra to New York City," explained Russakoff in an interview with FORBES. "We did it in conjunction with Ultra Records. We did an Ultra concert in New York for two years. And there was litigation, which settled this past Summer."
The dispute between Ultra Music Festival and the record label, Ultra Music, was based on a claim that Ultra Music Festival had infringed upon Ultra Music's trademark. At one point-in-time, the parties had settled the litigation, only to find themselves back in court based on a claimed breach of the settlement agreement. The breach was at least partially based on a clause that required Ultra Music Festival to include Ultra Music if Ultra Music Festival expanded beyond a Miami event. Under the direction of Russakoff, UMF Worldwide has expanded around the globe and into Korea, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Poland, Ibiza and Croatia.
"It is no longer just Ultra Miami, but Ultra Worldwide," said Russakoff to FORBES. "When I started, it was a one-day event, pretty disorganized, and had a bad name with the artists and vendors. Now we have two weekends in Miami and 330,000 people coming to the event. We have a stellar reputation with the over 300 artists that attended. The production this year was absolutely amazing. The staging itself and the technical production was at levels never seen before at a festival in the U.S. and possibly worldwide."
The future looks bright for UMF Worldwide and Russakoff, who was described to FORBES by a colleague of his as "a certified badass, who never backs down from a fight, all-in always and hustles day in and day out." The individual also singled Russakoff out as the best talent buyer on the planet. "Totally a larger than life personality, but one of the most loyal people you will ever meet." According to Russakoff, his average day is full of phone calls, emails and roughly 4-5 hours of sleep.
A lack of sleep appears to be a common thread for everything surrounding UMF Worldwide and its Ultra Music Festival. In fact, Russakoff's sleep schedule may be further impeded by UMF Worldwide's anticipated announcement of the addition of Ultra Music Festivals in two more countries. While the plan is to expand the festival around the world, UMF Worldwide has not yet determined that it will continue to offer the festival in Miami for two consecutive weekends. It was a lot of work for Russakoff, but he may be one of the few people on this earth willing and able to handle it.
"When you look at a festival, look at the number of artists in front of me and that many negotiations...each one is a separate story," said Russakoff. "To me, it's like a very intriguing novel. The future of Ultra Music Festival is to continue to be the world's leading EDM festival, forward thinking in terms of talent, production, and most importantly, experience for our fans." Russakoff would say that he was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity, that he is driven and passionate enough to execute at a higher level, and, most importantly, humble enough to realize that he just got lucky. "So damn lucky," actually.

<https://www.forbes.com/sites/susancunningham/2015/08/24/thailands-shrine-bombing-the-case-for-turkeys-grey-wolves/> dct:description """The most likely perpetrators of the deadly Bangkok bombing last week were militant members of a right-wing Turkish organization infuriated by the Thai governmentâ€™s forcible repatriation of Uighur refugees back to China. Anthony Davis, a veteran security analyst with IHS-Janeâ€™s, made a persuasive case for the Grey Wolves on a panel at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand Monday evening.
Update 30 August. A suspect has been arrested, found in a suburban Bangkok apartment supplied with bomb-making components and a pile of forged Turkish passports. He isn't talking, which hasn't stopped the national Thai police chief from making unsupported pronouncements.
Davis did not rule out the possibility that other foreign militant Muslim organizations could be responsible for August 18 bomb at the Erawan Shrine that killed 20 people and injured 126. He found it extremely unlikely, however, that it was the work of Thai dissident political groups or even of the Muslim insurgents in southern Thailand who have waged a separatist war in three border provinces for the past decade.
Some of the strongest evidence in favor of the ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves was the fury throughout Turkey that followed the Thai repatriation on July 9 of 109 Uighurs and the Grey Wolvesâ€™ visibility during the attacks on the Thai Embassy in Istanbul. A violent wing of the loosely organized pan-Turkic organization in recent years has taken up the cause of the Uighurs. The Uighurs are persecuted fellow Muslims in Chinaâ€™s western Xinjiang province, which Uighurs call â€œEast Turkestan.â€?
The planners behind the bombing probably chose the popular central Hindu-Buddhist shrine knowing it would claim some Chinese tourists as victims, Davis believes. Besides two mainlanders, nine of the dead were Chinese from Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. (The remainder were all Thai.)
The youth wing, or paramilitary division of the Nationalist Movement Party, the Grey Wolves were founded in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, Grey Wolves killed Kurds, left-wing intellectuals, students, and Christians. Mehmet Ali Agca, who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, was a member of Grey Wolves. Another member attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Turgut Ã–zal in 1988. In recent decades the party has moderated its platform but adopted a more Islamic stance. After the fall of the Soviet Union, soldiers fought under the Grey Wolves banner in both Chechnya wars as well as in the Nagorno-Karabakh War on the side of the Azerbaijanis against the Armenians. The organization was banned in Azerbaijan in 1995 after an attempted coup and in Kazakhstan in 2005. There are Grey Wolves groups in Germany, Netherlands, France and Belgium.
Davis dismissed the possibility of Uighurs themselves organizing the bombing, given that back home in Xinjiang province their attacks on the Chinese state have been very small scale. Everyone, including Thai authorities, seems to agree that the nature of the bomb and the size of the explosion were of a different order than anything seen in Bangkok before, despite the the past decade of violent acts (such as grenade attacks) by domestic political groups. â€œI have never seen anything of this level of carnage or this way foreigners being targeted. Thai political groups wouldnâ€™t target foreigners,â€? Davis said. â€œTo me, itâ€™s very simple. Such an event was not driven by any Thai political factor.â€?
Southern Insurgents Moving North?
The Erawan pipe bomb, employing industrial pipe and packed with TNT and ball bearings, was much more sophisticated than anything used so far by domestic groups. Davis said the devices used by southern insurgent groups, often incorporating two or three gas canisters with a booster charge, have become bigger over the past few years but the Erawan device did not resemble them. Southern Islamic insurgents, associated with the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) and Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO), also have been moving far from their their three home provinces in the past few years.
Southern insurgents are believed to have planted the car bomb that exploded in an underground garage in Koh Samui in April, injuring seven. Back in December 2013, a similar car bomb was set to go off behind the police station in Phuket but not detonated, as if the insurgents were displaying their capability as a warning to Thai authorities. In Davis's view, both incidents point to the reluctance of insurgents to target large numbers of foreign tourists.
What about a splinter group that had broken off from the main southern rebel organizations? â€œBRN has no interest in splinter groups taking the war into their own hands,â€? Davis said.
Canal Bomb Planted Within 30 Minutes of Erawan Explosion
The second bomb that exploded in a riverside canal August 19, the day after the Erawan bomb--fortunately injuring no oneâ€”â€œwas of the same typeâ€? as the Erawan bomb, Davis said. But original reports that this bomb was dropped from the Taksin Bridge on the same day have been proven wrong. CCTV video, as seen here, has now revealed that the bomb, enclosed in a plastic bag, was intentionally pushed into the canal from the footbridge by a man the previous eveningâ€”less than a half hour after the Erawan explosion.
As was the case with the Erawan bomber before and after the explosion, this video footage shows a man looking at a smartphone screen before dropping his package into canal. Davis speculated that this might have been a â€œback-upâ€? bomb in case the Erawan one had failed. Or perhaps a potential target, like a river boat full of tourists, had failed to materialize. â€œI donâ€™t believe he lost his nerve,â€? Davis said.
Regardless, the entire operation â€œwas carefully organized and well planned,â€? Davis said. Although some motorcycle taxi drivers near Sathorn Road believe that they had the Erawan bomber as a customer several times back in Feburary, none of the nearby hotels recognize the manâ€”suggesting that he stayed in the homes of accomplices. (The motorbike taxi drivers are certain the man was a foreigner, possibly from the Middle East. Two drivers that picked up the suspect before and after the Erawan bombing are also sure he was not Thai.)
And who might the accomplices be? Well, the Grey Wolves do have ties with organized crime syndicates â€œall over the worldâ€? and Thailand has representatives of quite a few of those.
IS or Al Qaeda?
Even if domestic forces can be eliminated as suspects, what about other foreign terrorist groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda?
â€œUndoubtedly IS has the capability and it hinges on local franchises, local organizations,â€? Davis said. And Muslim Thais could well be members of a brigade composed of volunteers from the Malay peninisula now fighting in Syria since hundreds of Malaysians, as well as some Indonesians and Flipinos are already known to be among these fighters. Morever, these Malaysian fighters there are being encouraged to bring jihad back to Malaysia, so why not Thailand?
Meanwhile, Al Qaeda shares a revenge motive similar to that of Grey Wolves. An Al Qaeda affliate, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), has a battalion comprised of Uighurs that has been fighting since 2012 in northwest Syria alongside the Al Nusra Front, the original army battling President Bashar al-Assad.
Those Uighur soldiers might have the capability to organize an attack like the Erawan bombing "but they want to export the fight back to Xinjiang. They have never expressed interest in taking the fight to Thailand," Davis said.
Both IS and Al Qaeda have also favored suicide attacks. Yet thereâ€™s another, stronger argument against either IS or Al Qaeda as the perpertrator, Davis pointed out: â€œIS and Al Qaeda live and breathe publicity.â€? And so far, no one has claimed responsibility for the Erawan Shrine bombing.""" ;

"It is well established that garden-variety election disputes do not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation," Judge Steven D. Grimberg ruled. "The fact that his candidate didn’t win doesn’t rise to the level of harm."
Judge Grimberg was appointed by the president in 2019.
Well-known Atlanta area attorney Lin Wood filed the 188-page suit against Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger to stop the certification scheduled to be completed by Friday.

A poll monitor, who described herself as being active in the Republican Party, testified in court. She described how she saw one batch of votes that looked "pristine," "uniform," and "looked like it was put on a copying machine." She said among the 100 ballots, 97 were for President-elect Joe Biden and two were for President Trump.
Lawyers said she is the only witness to testify for the hearing, but Ray Smith, who said he has been retained for this case by President Trump, said the poll watcher's testimony and some 15 affidavits are enough evidence to temporarily halt Georgia's certification.
State attorney Russ Willard argued the argument to halt the certification is moot, they lack standing, and there is no violation of due process. He asserted all state laws were followed at all times during this election.
"The plaintiff attempts to change the rules at the end of the game to alter the score," Willard told the judge. "The plaintiff seeks the largest disenfranchisement of eligible [voters] since the abolition of the poll tax and the vestiges of Jim Crow in the state of Georgia."

Kevin Hamilton, a lawyer for the Democratic Party of Georgia, argued the lawsuit sought to invalidate millions of lawful ballots "on the flimsiest of evidentiary records" and "no court has ever entered such sweeping relief."
Smith argued the rejection rate for signatures on mail-in ballots dropped dramatically even with the huge increase of mail-in ballots. The state attorney countered that Smith was using the wrong numbers and the mismatched signature rejection rate was the same as 2018.
According to the Secretary of State's Office, the number of rejected signatures did increase by approximately 350% from the 2018 election, but the reject rate remained at about 0.15%. A little more than 2,000 absentee ballots were rejected in this election out of the 1,322,529 mail-in ballots cast. In 2018, 454 absentee ballots were rejected out of the 284,393 mail-in ballots received.

Two previous lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign in Georgia were both dismissed, but during a press conference on Thursday, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said another lawsuit will be filed on Friday citing specific evidence uncovered in Atlanta.
Court watchers said this case makes 32 lawsuits filed as part of the president's post-election litigation to have been dismissed.

Investigators told the Associated Press that the student had been taken into custody alive. Details of the student's identity were not immediately available.
Russia Today reported that the gunman entered School No. 263 and threatened the school's security guard before making his way to a biology classroom, where he took 29 10th-grade students hostage before releasing most of them soon after. It is not clear when the rest of the children were released.
The security guard was able to call police to the scene with an alarm button, and the gunman reportedly shot two of the responding officers, one fatally. It is not clear when he shot the teacher.
The school was evacuated of the rest of the students, and police spokeswoman Karina Sabitova told the Associated Press that no children were injured.
All Russian schools are required to have at least one armed security guard as the result of legislation passed in the wake of the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, which ended in the deaths of over 300 people, including nearly 200 children.

<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/duke-of-sussex-unveils-sousse-and-bardo-memorial> dct:description """His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex has attended a ceremony today (4 March) in Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham to unveil the Sousse and Bardo memorial, which is dedicated to the 31 British people who lost their lives and all those affected by the two terrorist attacks in Tunisia in 2015.
The Duke of Sussex was joined by 300 guests, which included families of the victims and those caught up in both attacks, as well as Harriett Baldwin, Minister of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development, with responsibility for consular policy, and the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. The ceremony, led by BBC newsreader Ben Brown, who reported from Sousse soon after the terrorist attacks in June 2015, included readings from families of the victims and music from a the Birmingham Bach Choir.
The memorial entitled ‘Infinite Wave’ was designed by London and Gloucester-based George King Architects and remembers 31 British nationals, 30 who died as a result of the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015 and one British national who died at the Bardo Museum attack in March 2015.
The ‘Infinite Wave’ design was selected by an independent panel following the shortlisting of 7 designs from 19 entries and consultation with family members of those affected by the attacks. The single wave in the memorial structure is formed of 31 different threads, one for each British national who lost their lives, with the ripples surrounding the wave representing the effect this has had on the survivors, families and friends of the victims, and the impact on the wider community. The location of Cannon Hill Park, was also selected following a consultation with the families of the victims.
Minister of State for Consular Policy Harriett Baldwin said:
The huge sense of loss and grief felt by the families of the victims of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Tunisia will never leave them, but I hope this memorial will be a place where the families and loved ones of the victims, and all those affected, can find some solace and a point of remembrance in a tranquil setting. The construction of a permanent memorial dedicated to those who were so tragically killed underlines our pledge to never forget the victims of these atrocities.
George King, Principal of George King Architects said:
We are incredibly honoured to have been chosen to create this memorial to remember all those affected by the tragic events that took place in Tunisia in 2015. Throughout the design and construction process we have been acutely aware of the significance that this memorial has for the families who have lost loved ones, the survivors and the wider community. We put them and their experiences very much at the heart of the design concept. Together with our team of expert consultants, fabricators and contractors we have focused on translating our unique design into reality with a focus on craftsmanship, quality and fine detailing in order to create a meaningful place of reflection and contemplation within the beautiful setting of Cannon Hill Park. We are extremely proud of our team whose hard work and dedication over the past two years has delivered a beautiful and poignant memorial that we hope will have a special place in people’s hearts for many years to come.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office have led the design process, construction and unveiling ceremony of the Sousse and Bardo Memorial.
Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Councillor Yvonne Mosquito, said:
This beautiful memorial to the 31 people who lost their lives in the Tunisia terror attacks will provide a peaceful place for their friends and family to remember them in Cannon Hill Park – a location chosen by their loved ones. I truly hope it helps these families – and anyone else affected by the 2015 terror attacks – to find solace by visiting the memorial.

<https://www.gpb.org/news/2020/12/01/someones-going-get-killed-election-official-blasts-gop-silence-on-threats> dct:description """A top election official in Georgia had scathing words for President Donald Trump and other top Republican leaders who have been attacking Georgia's election system in recent weeks after a spate of reported harassment and death threats during the state's recount.
A Twitter thread accusing a young technician of altering votes in Gwinnett County led to his identity being released and calls for him to be "hung for treason." Caravans of horn-honking Trump supporters constantly parade past Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's private residence and his wife has received sexually explicit threats. President Trump himself has suggested that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp "call off election" and falsely suggested he won the state's 16 electoral votes.
"Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed," Gabriel Sterling with the secretary of state's office said Monday afternoon in an emotional and forceful press conference. "It's not right."
Sterling, a fixture in recent weeks as a calm, even-tempered source of election information and factoids about the complicated counting processes, unloaded on Trump, both Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and other GOP officials that have egged on the party's base to believe in widespread fraud.
"It has to stop," he said. "Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up. And if you take a position of leadership, show some."
Sterling said the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was a report that a Gwinnett County technician was outed and receiving death threats after a video circulated online purportedly showing him manipulating data as part of an official recount.
"A 20-something tech in Gwinnett County today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from an EMS to a county computer so he could read it," Sterling said. "His family is getting harassed now. There's a noose out there with his name on it. And it's not right. I've got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher profile job. I get it, the Secretary ran for office, his wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job, and it's just wrong."
Ron Watkins, the former administrator of extremist site 8kun that played host to posts from the Qanon conspiracy theory, was one of the main boosters of that video. Watkins has also encouraged followers to monitor and livestream several county elections warehouses in search of evidence of impropriety.
Tuesday afternoon, police were called to a Gwinnett County location where a man who was livestreaming had followed workers he believed were secretly transporting voting machines in violation of a court order. On the video, an officer explained that boxes were full of office phones, and told the man he was trespassing.
The president, both of Georgia's U.S. senators, many House members, several GOP state lawmakers and the chair of the Republican Party of Georgia have all cast doubt on the 2020 election process with little to no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing.
Sterling said those leaders, especially Perdue and Loeffler, need to "step up" and fight back against conspiracies.
"You have to be responsible in your rhetoric, you have to be responsible in your statements, you have to be responsible in your deeds," Sterling said. "That shouldn't be too much to ask for people who asked for us to give them responsibility."
Read Sterling's full remarks below and follow GPB's Battleground: Ballot Box blog here:
"Good afternoon. My name is Gabriel Sterling and I’m the voting system implementation manager for State of Georgia. And just to give you a heads up, this is going to be sort of a two-part press conference today. At the beginning of this, I'm going to do my best to keep it together.
Because it has all gone too far. All of it.
Joe diGenova today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran CISA, to be shot. A 20-something tech in Gwinnett County today has death threats and a noose put out, saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from an EMS to a county computer so he could read it.
It has to stop.
Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up. And if you take a position of leadership, show some.
My boss, Secretary Raffensperger — his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house, they've had people come onto their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone.
It has to stop.
This is elections, this is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It's too much.
Yes, fight for every single vote. Go through your due process, we encourage you — use your First Amendment. That's fine. Death threats, physical threats, intimidation — it's too much. It's not right. We've lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.
I don't have all the best words to do this because I'm angry, and the straw that broke the camel's back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting system company just trying to do his job. In fact, I talked to Dominion today and they said he's one of the better ones they got. His family is getting harassed now. There's a noose out there with his name on it. And it's not right.
I've got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it, Secretary ran for office, his wife knew that, too. This kid took a job. He just took a job, and it's just wrong.
I can't begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this, and every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.
Mr. President. It looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We're investigating. There's always a possibility, I get it, and you have the rights to go through the courts. What you don't have the ability to do — and you need to step up and say this — is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed. And it's not right.
It's not right. And I don't have anything scripted — this is like I said, I will do my best to keep it together. All of this is wrong. DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former U.S. attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better.
Mr. President,as the secretary said yesterday, people aren't giving you the best advice on what's actually going on the ground. It's time to look forward if you want to run for reelection in four years. Fine, do it. But everything we're seeing right now, there's not a path. Be the bigger man here and stop. Step in, tell your supporters: Don't be violent, don't intimidate. All that's wrong. It's unAmerican.
I don't know what else to say on that front. I mean, these are elections. One of our goals was to make elections boring again. Well, guess what? That didn't happen. This is all wrong. It's all too much, and that's I'll leave that for there.\"""" ;

President Trump’s lead is largely due to white voters which he leads by a 40-point margin. Biden holds a 69-point lead among African American voters which is helping him keep the race close.
Looking at the Senate elections in Georgia this year, the GOP has the advantage. Democrats have not won a Senate election in Georgia since the 2000 special election when former Governor Zel Miller defeated former Senator Mack Mattingly. In the new Gravis poll, Purdue leads Ossoff 48%-43% with 9% undecided. Purdue is aided by his 38-point advantage with white voters while pulling 20% of African Americans. The special Senate election appears to be up for grabs for either Collins or Loeffler. Collins leads the field with 26% and fellow Republican Loeffler at 24%. The Democrats in the race include Warnock at 18%, Lieberman at 11% and Tarver at 9%. 18% remain undecided. If the race proceeds to an all Republican runoff, Collins holds a 34%-28% edge with 37% of voters undecided. The other matchups all pretty much fall along the same line of a GOP advantage regardless which Republican advances. Loeffler leads Warnock 48%-37% and Lieberman 46%-39% while Collins leads Warnock 47%-38% and Lieberman 46%-37%.
Job approval for Republicans across the board is positive in the state of Georgia. President Trump holds a 54%-42% approval split, while Governor Kemp is at 60%-36%, Perdue at 56%-35% and Loeffler at 52%-39%.
Voters in Georgia trust Trump over Biden to handle the economy by a 50%-44% margin and by a 51%-43% trust Trump over Biden to prevent violent riots in American cities. The poll finds broad support for local police departs. 71% indicate that they support their local police department while only 16% do not support. 73% believe that police departments should continue to be funded while 15% believe that they should be defunded. Georgians also blame protestors by a 19-point margin over the police for the recent riots across the country.
On the coronavirus response, the poll finds broad support in Georgia (76%-14%) for international travel restrictions. The poll also finds that voters in Georgia (61%-26%) believe that the United States would have been affected to a lesser extent by the coronavirus had China taken earlier steps to mitigate the spread of the virus.
This poll was conducted by Gravis Marketing, a nonpartisan research and data firm. This poll of 513 likely voters in North Carolina was conducted on July 2nd and has a margin of error of ±4.3%.

<https://www.heritagesociety.org/william-marsh-rice> dct:description """William Marsh Rice was born on March 14, 1816 to David and Patty Hall Rice in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was named William Marsh after the clergyman who organized his family’s church. Lured by unlimited potential for business, Rice traveled to Texas in 1838. He bought 320 acres of land in the town of Houston and opened a general store on the east side of Main Street between Congress and Franklin Avenues. Over a period of years Rice became one of the most important commission merchants and cotton factors in all of Texas. Cotton came to his warehouse from as far away as Dallas, and in turn those cotton growers bought the manufactured goods that Rice stocked in his store. Because banks were illegal and nonexistent in Houston, Rice was also able to provide all manner of banking services, except the issuance of currency. By April 1865, he was worth over $1 million, due in large part to the fact that he was able to continue to operate his business out of Mexico during the Civil War.
In 1887, Rice had a pivotal meeting with the President of the Houston School Board, Cesar Lombardi, to discuss the possibility of Rice funding the construction of a high school in Houston. After much deliberation, Rice concluded not to erect the building, and instead, he planned “to endow an institution of learning separate and distinct from the public school system, a sort of auxiliary to it, planned largely upon the Cooper’s Institute in New York and to be known as the Wm. M. Rice Institute of Literature, Science and Art.” On May 13, 1891, the trustees, under a deed of indenture, agreed to hold Rice’s note for $200,000 as an endowment to provide for “the establishment and maintenance of a thorough polytechnic school, for males and females, designed to give instructions on the application of Sciences and Arts to the useful occupations of life, and that the Library, Reading Room, Scientific Departments and Polytechnic School and the instruction, benefits and enjoyment to be derived from the Institute to be free.”
Just a few years later, the endowment was in jeopardy. In June 1896, just before Rice’s second wife Elizabeth died, Orren T. Holt drew a new will for her which deemed her a resident of Harris County, and under Texas community property law, allowed her to dispose of one-half of Rice’s assets acquired during their marriage. Holt and several of Elizabeth’s family members benefited greatly from this new dubious will. The will, kept a secret from William, was admitted to probate in Harris County court in March 1897. Soon after, Rice filed suit against Holt in which he claimed to be a resident of the state of New York, devoid of community property laws.
Lawyer Albert T. Patrick was hired by Holt to take testimony in the case of Rice v. Holt and thus became acquainted with Rice’s large bequest to his Institute. Patrick fabricated a new will naming himself as residual heir instead of the institute, and with the help of Rice’s valet, Charlie Jones, obtained witnesses and a notary. In order for the men to profit, Rice needed to die. In the late spring and early summer of 1900, Patrick provided Jones with mercury pills for Rice, but they produced minimal effects.
On September 8, 1900, the Galveston hurricane severely damaged Rice’s properties and on September 16 his cottonseed mill burned. Rice agreed to use the entire balance of his checking account—$250,000—to repair his properties. By that point, Rice’s fate was sealed. Patrick instructed Jones to use chloroform on Rice and a doctor certified Rice’s death on September 23 from natural causes. An alert bank clerk noticed the next day that a large check, actually forged by Jones, had misspelled the recipient’s name - Albert T. Patrick. A telephone call for verification revealed that Rice died the evening before and bank officials telegraphed Rice’s attorney in Houston, James Baker. Jones was arrested and confessed to his part in Rice’s death and implicated Patrick who was then indicted for murder and forgery.
Although he had no direct heirs, William Marsh Rice’s legacy lives on though the University that he established in the city where he built his fortune. The lawsuit and countersuit regarding Rice’s estate lasted until February 1902. The cornerstone for the Administration Building (Lovett Hall) was laid on March 2, 1911. Exactly ten years after the murder, on September 23, 1912, Rice Institute opened its doors to its first class of students.

<https://www.history.com/news/how-the-galveston-hurricane-of-1900-became-the-deadliest-u-s-natural-disaster> dct:description """The deadliest natural disaster in American history remains the 1900 hurricane in the island city of Galveston, Texas. On September 8, a category four hurricane descended on the town, destroying more than 3,600 buildings with winds surpassing 135 miles per hour.
Estimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 12,000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Tragically, the magnitude of the disaster could’ve been lessened if the U.S. Weather Bureau hadn’t implemented such poor communication policies.

When the storm picked up in early September of 1900, “any modestly educated weather forecaster would’ve known that” it was passing west, says Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Over in Cuba, where scientists had become very good at tracking storms in the hurricane-prone Caribbean, they “knew that a hurricane had passed to the north of Cuba and was headed to the Gulf of Mexico.”
The Weather Bureau in Washington, however, predicted that the storm would pass over Florida and up to New England—which was very, very wrong.
“I mean they were just way off target,” he says.
The Weather Bureau—predecessor to the National Weather Service—was only 10 years old, and hurricane science in the U.S. wasn’t very advanced. “Galveston occurred at a very interesting time in the science of hurricanes,” Emanuel notes.

The bureau’s director, Willis Moore, “was so jealous of the Cubans that he shut off the flow of data from Cuba to the U.S.,” he says. At the same time, Moore told regional U.S. forecasters that “that they could not on their own issue a hurricane warning, they had to go through Washington”—not a very quick or easy task, in those days.
The combination of blocking information from Cuba, while also making it difficult for local forecasters to report hurricanes, turned out to be deadly.
In the couple days before the storm hit, the Weather Bureau’s chief observer in Galveston, Isaac Cline, began to suspect that Washington’s forecast had been off. He tried to warn the city, but it was too late. Cline’s wife was killed, the port city was devastated, and Galveston was never able to fully recover.

The 1900 hurricane was a wake-up call that the Weather Bureau needed to have better communication channels if it wanted to keep people safe.
“The Galveston hurricane made people realize you can’t play politics with a weather bureau,” Emanuel says. “If you make it political, people will die.”
U.S. hurricane science wouldn’t really take off until the 1940s. But after Galveston, the bureau began to open up communication channels both internationally and within the the country. Although the U.S. had begun to send wireless messages out to sea before the hurricane, the practice became more widespread after Galveston.

Today, the U.S. is good at accurately forecasting hurricanes and communicating storm paths to affected areas. “We have come light years from where we were in 1900,” says Jay Barnes, a hurricane historian who has written about storms in North Carolina and Florida.
The bigger problem, which Galveston would still have faced if it had been properly warned in 1900, is the logistical challenge of evacuating large metropolitan areas in short amounts of time, Emanuel says.
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans because of government negligence, not an inability to accurately predict and communicate the storm’s path. Hurricane Harvey, which wreaked havoc in Houston as well as modern-day Galveston in August 2017, was also well-forecasted. But without functional emergency plans for mass evacuations, cities still end up suffering from natural disasters—even if they can see them coming.""" ;

In a press conference held on Friday, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that Ultra Music Festival 2020 is officially postponed due to the coronavirus.
"We're emphasizing to the public that this decision is not a cause for alarm or panic, but rather that we are doing it with an abundance of caution," Suarez stated. "We are obtaining this guidance from the CDC, which defines mass gatherings as those with 25,000 people or more."
Roughly 170,000 people were set to attend Ultra Music Festival 2020, which was supposed to happen March 20-22 at Bayfront Park in Miami. Headliners were to include Flume, Major Lazer and Zedd.
An announcement posted to the Ultra website and to Instagram by Ultra's Executive Producer Adam Russakoff states that, "It is with a heavy heart that we inform you that The City of Miami has issued an official directive requiring that the 22nd edition of Ultra Music Festival, originally scheduled for March 20, 21 and 22, 2020 will be postponed to March 26, 27 and 28, 2021.
"Due to the Florida Governor’s declaration of a public health emergency and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention’s Interim Guidance for COVID-19, it is impossible for the City to provide access to Bayfront Park at this time. We completely understand how extremely frustrating this is because so many of you are looking forward to coming to Ultra, having already made travel arrangements. This is, however, an unprecedented issue which is not being taken lightly, and we must continue to defer to the authorities for guidance.
"Ultimately, there is no higher priority for us than the health, safety and physical well-being of each of you, together with everyone else involved in the production of the event. We sincerely thank you for your continued loyalty and patience during this difficult time. All ticket purchasers will be contacted by email on Monday regarding next steps."
Mayor Suarez also announced that the city will not approve the special events permit for the city's annual Calle Ocho Festival, part of Carnaval Miami, which will cause a postponement of that festival as well.

Through the first four days of early voting, roughly 511,675 Harris County residents have cast their ballots at early voting locations or through the mail. That is more than half the total early and absentee turnout from 2016, when some 985,000 Harris County residents voted before Election Day.
There still are two weeks of early voting to go. Residents have 112 sites to choose from before the early period ends Oct. 30. The polls are open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and from noon to 7 p.m. Sunday.
Voters have until Oct. 23 to request a mail ballot, and must post-mark those votes by 7 p.m. on Election Day for them to count.

<https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Hidalgo-asks-Abbott-to-confirm-drive-thru-voting-15667812.php> dct:description """The Texas Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a request by Republicans to halt drive-thru voting in Harris County, an option already used by more than 70,000 residents during the first two weeks of early voting.
The all-Republican court declined to grant two requests from plaintiffs that include the state and county Republican parties and Houston conservative activist Steven Hotze, who argued that drive-thru voting was not permitted under the Texas Election Code and should be stopped.
The majority did not explain its decision. The lone dissenter, Justice John Devine, said Harris County Clerk Christopher Hollins had exceeded his authority in creating the drive-thru option, and by not granting the Republicans’ request, “thousands of ballots continue to be cast through what is likely an unauthorized voting procedure.”
Harris County offers drive-thru voting at 10 polling locations, most of them consisting of tents in which voters are checked in by poll workers and presented with an electronic voting machine to cast their ballots while still in their cars.
The legal setback was a latest in a series of attempts by Republicans to limit voting options in Texas during what is on pace to be the highest-turnout election in state history. The group failed in their attempts to roll back an extra week of early voting and limit when mail ballots may be delivered in person.
They succeeded in preventing Harris County from sending mail ballot applications to all voters; Gov. Greg Abbott also decided to limit the number of mail ballot drop-off sites in each county to one.
Thursday’s high court decision was only a partial victory for Harris County leaders, however. The Supreme Court did not declare drive-thru voting to be legal, as the local Democrats had hoped, leaving open the possibility of a post-election challenge of those ballots, Assistant Harris County Attorney Douglas Ray said.
“We believe it’s possible that if the number of votes cast could be material to the outcome of any of the elections, that an election challenge could be filed by the person who lost, saying they really should have won if all these illegal ballots hadn’t been counted,” Ray said, adding the county would prepare for such a challenge.
Allen West, chairman of the state Republican Party, said he was perplexed by the Supreme Court’s decision, and pledged to keep fighting.
“This whole situation would have been avoided if the unelected, partisan Chris Hollins had not abused his position … to manipulate the election process and undermine electoral integrity,” West said in a statement.
Harris County Republican Party Chairman Keith Neilsen acknowledged the lawsuit was a long shot, but said “there are a lot of serious issues with the drive-thru voting locations and they need to be addressed.”
Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, in a tweet, called the court’s decision “a victory for democracy, for the thousands of courageous voters who have participated, even in the face of suppression attempts, and it’s a fair interpretation of the law.”
Earlier Thursday, Hidalgo asked Abbott in a letter to confirm that drive-thru voting is legal, amid worries the high court would block the voting method, throwing the legality of about 73,000 ballots already collected into question.
Hidalgo said the governor’s input was needed because Harris County officials unsuccessfully had sought an answer from Secretary of State Ruth Hughs earlier.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton last week issued an opinion in which he suggested Harris County’s drive-thru voting option, new this year, was unlawful.
Hidalgo and Hollins said they were concerned the Supreme Court may invalidate votes cast at drive-thru sites; Harris is the only county to use them. Hollins wrote a letter to Hughs earlier this week, asking her to affirm the legality of drive-thru voting.
“In absence of such an assurance, we can only conclude that state officials, in concert with the Texas Republican Party, are laying the groundwork to intentionally disenfranchise the tens of thousands of Harris County voters who have utilized drive-thru voting by invalidating their votes,” Hidalgo wrote to the governor. “If this were to come to pass, it would be an outrageous act of voter suppression.”
The lawsuit and opinion from Paxton puzzled Hollins. Harris County’s election plans have been public since August, and no state official had raised issue with his drive-thru voting plan. The Supreme Court rejected the Republicans’ request to shorten early voting in part because the plaintiffs waited too long to file suit. Changing the rules after voting had begun, the court reasoned in that suit, would cause confusion.
Hollins praised the court’s decision Thursday, adding that voters had raved about their drive-thru voting experiences.
“It is unprecedented to have such clear partisan politics attempt to undercut the voting operations of a single county, a county that has provided its voting electorate with more voting access than ever before,” he said in a statement.
More than 900,000 votes have been cast in Harris County so far, more than the entire 2010 and 2014 elections.

In an unsigned order, the court denied a petition filed by Houston activist Steve Hotze, state Rep. Steve Toth, R-The Woodlands, and two Republican candidates who argued that drive-thru voting violates state and federal election laws. Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins has contended the procedure does not conflict with any laws, noting the Texas secretary of state approved it earlier this year.
County officials applauded the ruling but sought to remind voters that a separate case remains pending before U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen, an appointee of former President George W. Bush who has scheduled a hearing for 10:30 a.m. Monday.
“I do acknowledge that the fact that we’re even having this conversation is cause for concern,” County Judge Lina Hidalgo said, adding that she believes tossing the votes would be an “outrageous act of suppression.”
The federal courts have yet to issue rulings related to drive-thru voting, though the Texas Supreme Court had previously weighed in on the matter, rejecting an attempt by the Harris County and Texas Republican Parties, along with Hotze, to halt drive-thru voting.
Hidalgo and Hollins assured voters at a news conference Sunday that state and federal law is firmly on their side. Hollins argued that “the crux of the case is that we made voting too easy,” characterizing the challenge as “undemocratic and un-American.”
“We are going to do everything in our power to ensure that your votes are counted, however you cast them, whether by mail, whether you walked into a voting center or whether you utilized a drive-thru voting center,” Hollins said.
Hollins also asked federal, state and county candidates on the Harris County ballot to publicly state their view on the lawsuit, making the request in a series of tweets. By early Sunday evening, numerous Democratic candidates had responded that they oppose the effort, while only one Republican, state Rep. Sarah Davis of Houston, had joined them in voicing opposition. Texas Republican leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, also had yet to weigh in.
Joe Straus, a Republican and former Texas House speaker, released a statement calling the legal challenge “patently wrong.”
“While it may be too late for this election, the Republican Party needs to return to a place where we win with ideas and persuasion rather than trying to intimidate and silence our fellow citizens,” Straus said. “I hope all elected statewide leaders in the Texas Republican Party will stand up against these desperate tactics.”
The county clerk’s office had tallied more than 1.44 million ballots through the end of early voting. About 9 percent of the votes came from drive-thru voting centers.

The court will still need to decide whether it will grant a longer-lasting stay, which would be in effect until the end of the appeal.

But Austin District Judge Robert Pitman ruled on Friday that Abbott’s Oct. 1 proclamation came too late, after officials already started mailing absentee ballots and some, like Harris and Travis counties, had planned for multiple dropoff sites.
Abbott had said he made the decision to protect against voter fraud, though he offered no evidence and experts have said it is highly unlikely. Harris and Travis counties had opted to open additional sites to make voting more convenient and safe amid the pandemic.
In the 46-page order released Friday, Pitman cited Supreme Court precedent that says election law should not be changed too near an election to eliminate voter confusion and complications for election officials.
“Even without declaratory evidence, it is apparent that closing ballot return centers at the last minute would cause confusion, especially when those centers were deemed safe, authorized, and, in fact, advertised as a convenient option just months ago,” Pitman wrote.

The clerk’s office announced that 105,175 people went to the polls Thursday, marking the third day in a row it hit the six-figure mark. The county had achieved 100,000 early votes in a single day only once before 2020, on the final day of early voting in 2016.
The tally was 128,186 on Tuesday and 114,996 Wednesday. The clerk’s office said it also has received more than 50,000 mail ballots, bringing the total number cast so far to 398,966, with more than two weeks of early voting remaining.
In 2016, the county tallied about 884,000 early votes and 101,000 mail ballots.
County officials are expecting a record turnout for the Nov. 3 election, buoyed by an additional 234,000 registered voters since 2016, expanded early voting hours and a tripling of early voting locations. Gov. Greg Abbott approved an additional week of early voting to give Texans plenty of opportunity to cast ballots safely during the coronavirus pandemic.
VOTER GUIDE: Who's on your ballot?
There are 112 early voting sites in Harris County, including 10 with drive-through voting. The clerk’s office is posting daily vote totals for each site here.
One site in Southeast Houston was temporarily closed Thursday after a clerk tested positive for COVID-19, the clerk’s office said. The county immediately closed the site at Iglesia Una Luz en Tu Camino and sent in a cleaning crew. The other workers were taken for rapid tests this afternoon and are now quarantining and awaiting their results, a clerk’s spokeswoman said. The workers will quarantine for 10 to 14 days.
The county then deployed a new staff and reopened the site.
Three people who arrived to vote during that time were redirected to other poll locations.
Some popular sites, such as the Metropolitan Multi-Services Center and the Lake Houston Church of Christ, have processed more than 2,000 votes each day. Others, including the Milton Lusk Activity Center and the Houston Food Bank, have seen fewer than 400.
In Republican-heavy portions of west Harris County, voters were reporting 40-plus-minute wait times to cast their ballots at Juergens Hall, which processed some 2,400 ballots in the first two days of voting.
Clerk Christopher Hollins said voting machines were disbursed almost evenly across the county, with slightly more in Precincts 1 and 4. Those represented by a Democrat and a Republican, respectively.
“Some locations experienced lines due to record turnout on the first day of Early Voting (128,000! Higher turnout than the entire state of Georgia!),” Hollins wrote on Twitter. “We have evaluated turnout figures and allocated additional machines to accommodate voters wherever it would help.”

Harris County Clerk Christopher Hollins said the record participation is a return on investment for his office’s ambitious elections plan, which included nearly tripling the number of early voting sites, extending polling hours, adding voting machines and encouraging voting by mail.
Now Playing:
“It shouldn’t surprise us that more Texans vote when we make voting easy and accessible to everyone,” Hollins said. “People across this county are yearning to have their voices heard.”
Wednesday picked up where Tuesday left off. Voters on Tuesday shattered the record for first day of early voting, with more than 128,000 ballot cast and 41,000 mail ballots received. The previous first day record was 68,000 votes, set in 2016.
According to a Houston Chronicle analysis, 61 percent of Tuesday’s votes came from precincts Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016, while 39 percent came from precincts won by President Trump
In that year, 58 percent of all ballots came from Clinton precincts, compared to 42 percent for Trump, meaning a potential swing of 3 points toward Democrats in the first day of early voting. Clinton carried Harris County by 12 points in 2016.
Ballots cast so far in precincts where Clinton four years ago won at least 75 percent of the vote comprise 3.4 percent more of the overall tallies than they did in the 2016 contest. And in precincts where she got less than 25 percent of the vote four years ago, this year’s votes so far make up 1.2 percent less of the overall tally than was the case four years ago.
Despite the numbers, little can be gleaned about which party is winning after a single day of in-person voting. The early numbers could suggest local Democrats are poised to pummel Republicans up and down the ballot, or merely that their voters are more eager to complete their ballots.
Or both can be true, University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said.
“Given President Trump’s rhetoric on voting and Texas Republican efforts to constrain opportunities for voting, Democrats want to see their ballots in the box early,” he said.
A Pew Research Center poll in August found Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to believe voting would be difficult this year; another found supporters of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were much more likely to vote by mail.
What is indisputable is that Harris County, the most populous in the state, continues to set turnout records. More residents cast ballots Wednesday than any other early voting day in county history — except for Tuesday.
That also meant long lines again were a problem at some poll locations. At noon, almost a third of the county’s 112 early vote sites reported waits of more than 40 minutes.
Delays in traditionally Republican west Harris County were particularly lengthy, where more than half of the early voting sites had 40-minute-plus lines. Precinct 4 Commissioner Jack Cagle on Tuesday asked County Clerk Christopher Hollins to deploy more voting machines to the area.
The two Republican commissioner precincts have about 54 percent of the county’s registered voters but just 45 percent of early voting sites.
“I was hoping it’d be in-and-out today, but I guess not,” said Don Peters as he arrived at the Klein Multipurpose Center in northwest Harris County.
Peters questioned whether county officials put “all their new money” into more Democrat-leaning areas.
A spokeswoman for Hollins noted the county has secured additional voting machines since 2016. She did not respond to a question about whether the county has re-deployed resources based on turnout so far.
Harris County’s turnout also likely is boosted by its larger voter roll, which has grown by more than 230,000 voters since the last presidential election in 2016.

Although perhaps in excess of 12,000, the exact count of people who died in Galveston on September 8, 1900, will never be known. “The death toll is the reason the Great Storm stands apart from all other hurricanes,” says Casey Greene, head of Special Collections at Rosenberg Library, Galveston. “The 1900 storm is an object of continuing fascination because it is the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States.”
It was September 8, and the population of Galveston was 37,000, marking it as the fourth largest city in Texas. On this night, the number dropped drastically. Not only were 3,600 buildings demolished, but so many people were killed that their bodies exceeded the capacity of conventional burials. Many were weighted and buried at sea, only to wash ashore later. Funeral pyres lighted the town of Galveston, flashing desperate memorials to the deceased. Eventually, the numbers became so great that residents were permitted to bury the bodies of storm victims however they saw fit.
One hundred years later, this disaster is known as the Great Storm. Present-day contractors continue to dig up unmarked graves of storm victims.
Galveston Island managed to make a relatively swift recovery from its unprecedented tragedy. “To protect Galveston against future hurricanes, Galveston adopted the commission form of local government in 1901,” Greene reports. “The construction of the Seawall took place beginning in 1902, followed by the grade raising starting in 1904.” The city was raised by eight feet, seven feet at the Seawall, slanting the ground to facilitate the runoff of water into the bay. When the next hurricane hit in 1915, Galveston was prepared and safe; the storm caused only eight deaths.
Still, how could such widespread devastation not leave a permanent mark on the soul of a city? It’s precisely from such history that legends are born. The ghost of Sister Katherine is one such legend.
FACTS:
St. Mary’s Orphan Asylum housed 93 children, who were cared for by 10 nuns, sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. The orphanage was run by Sister Katherine. The children who lived there had been orphaned primarily as a result of yellow fever epidemics.
On September 7, 1900, a hurricane quietly entered the Gulf. By the next day, however, the storm had gained power. The nuns at St. Mary’s, in a desperate attempt to save their young charges, relocated the children from the boys’ dormitory to the new girls’ dormitory. From there, they watched the boys’ dormitory succumb to the relentless winds and water.
Prayers and hymns served as the only comfort for the terrified group. Round after round of “Queen of the Waves,” a hymn sung by French fishermen during storms, carried their spirits for some time, but by nightfall, it was clear that more deliberate actions must be taken.
As winds raged at 150 mph, the nuns decided to tie a piece of clothesline around each of their waists and then around the wrists of about six or eight children. They surrendered their fate to God’s will. Soon after, the mighty storm lifted the girls’ dormitory off its foundations, causing the building’s bottom to fall out and sending its roof crashing down, trapping its inhabitants.
Only three children survived the catastrophe—the boys wound up in the water and awoke to find themselves clinging to a tree, upon which they floated for nearly a day. They were later rescued at sea by a small boat and returned to town, where they discovered the gruesome fates of the orphanage, the 10 nuns, and the other children in their care.
Bodies were found—many children were still attached to the sisters via the clotheslines–and buried.
St. Mary’s Orphan Asylum reopened at 40th and Q streets in Galveston City in 1901 and remained there until closing in 1967.
The Hotel Galvez was built on the asylum’s original site on Galveston Island in 1911. A grand hotel, exquisitely furnished, blossomed as a tourist attraction and host to many celebrities, including actors and U.S. presidents. Fondly, the hotel became known as “Queen of the Gulf.”
LEGEND & FOLKLORE:
To this very day, many Galvestonians speak of a figure dressed in nun’s clothing walking along the shore as though to warn of incoming storms.
Guests of the Hotel Galvez, regarded as the most haunted building in the U.S., report significant poltergeist activity, including doors opening and closing and lights turning off and on by themselves. The legend is that the spirits of the St. Mary’s orphans linger in the spots where their lives were taken on this fateful day, over a hundred years ago.

Harris County shattered its single-day early voting record Tuesday, as more than 128,000 people headed to the polls on the first day of early voting.
The county had reached a new first-day early voting as of 2 p.m., and by the time the last person cast their vote, 128,186 people had been unofficially tallied, representing more than 5% of all 2.4 million Harris County voters.
Some voters are still at the polls, but it's looking like more people voted today in Harris County (>128,000) than on the first day of Early Voting in the ENTIRE STATE OF GEORGIA. Kind of a big deal. cc: @HarrisVotes — Chris Hollins (@CGHollins) October 14, 2020
The previous one-day record is 100,005 votes on the last day of the 2016 election, according to the office of Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins.
The previous record for the first day of early voting was 67,471, also in 2016.
The county clerk on Tuesday night also revealed more than 41,000 mail-in ballots had been returned. In total, 169,523 votes have been counted so far in the general election.

Texas is one of just five states in the U.S. that didn’t expand mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading many to fear a depressed in-person turnout. The state is also in the middle of a series of election lawsuits — the latest one filed by the Texas Republican Party in an attempt to limit curbside voting.
But the first-day turnout was a promising sign for the Greater Houston area, and for Texas as a whole, which now has about 17 million registered voters after adding nearly 300,000 to the rolls since just Sept. 22, as the Texas Newsroom’s Ashley Lopez reported.
Polls in Harris County open again Wednesday at 7 a.m., and close at 7 p.m. The last day of early voting is Oct. 30.
Election Day is Nov. 3.

(London, May 11, 2004) — The Nigerian government should immediately conduct an independent investigation into the massacre of several hundred people in Yelwa on May 2, Human Rights Watch said today. The federal and state authorities should also take concrete steps to prevent a further escalation of interethnic violence in Plateau State.
“Unlike the findings of previous commissions of inquiry, the results of this investigation should be made public and acted upon,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division.
Armed members of the predominantly Christian Tarok ethnic group on May 2 attacked the town of Yelwa, in the southern part of Plateau State, apparently in reprisal for earlier attacks against Taroks by members of the predominantly Muslim Fulani ethnic group. Local sources described the attack on Yelwa, where the majority of the population is Fulani, as devastating.
Several hundred people were killed according to credible accounts based on the testimonies of local residents, although an accurate death toll is not yet available. The perpetrators used fire arms and machetes, and the victims were buried in several mass graves. There was also widespread destruction in the town. Thousands of inhabitants of Yelwa have been displaced, and the area has become extremely polarized.
The attack on Yelwa followed a string of earlier attacks and counterattacks by Taroks and Fulanis, who have been engaged in a prolonged conflict over land use as well as political and economic control.
Human Rights Watch called on the Nigerian government to bring to justice those responsible for the Yelwa killings, particularly leaders who orchestrated the attacks. To prevent a further spread of violence, the authorities should take concrete measures including deploying an adequate number of police in areas of tension and disarming local militia in the state.
Plateau State has been ravaged by interethnic conflict since an unprecedented outbreak of violence in the state capital, Jos, claimed as many as one thousand lives in September 2001. The government set up a commission of inquiry into the violence in Jos, but has still not published its findings. Hundreds of people — both Taroks and Fulanis — have been killed in different parts of the state since 2002. The fighting around Yelwa has intensified since February 2004, when scores of people died, including around 50 Taroks reportedly killed by Fulanis in Yelwa at the end of February.
“In light of the pattern of violence in Plateau State over recent months, with each community seeking to avenge attacks by their opponents, the latest outbreak should have come as no surprise to federal and state authorities,” said Takirambudde. “Yet the Nigerian government took no action to preempt the massacre.”
Human Rights Watch denounced the failure of the Nigerian government and the security forces to provide security to the population of Plateau State. In the latest incident, police and army reinforcements were only sent to Yelwa after hundreds of people had already been killed.
“The government’s neglect of the situation in Plateau over the last three years has resulted in an endless cycle of revenge,” Takirambudde said. “Not only have the police been unwilling or unable to stop the fighting, but the government has not taken responsibility for finding a lasting solution to the crisis.”""" ;

<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-wins-kansas-primary_n_5eaecc11c5b69a7955193678> dct:description """TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Joe Biden has overwhelmingly won a Democratic presidential primary in Kansas that the state party conducted exclusively by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The former vice president had been expected to prevail in Saturday’s vote and capture a majority of the state’s delegates to the Democrats’ national nominating commission. Biden took 77% of the vote.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was still in the race when the Kansas party began mailing ballots at the end of March, but he suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.
Sanders easily won Kansas’ caucuses in 2016 over former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, riding a surge of enthusiasm among liberal voters and first-time caucus-goers. But the state party mailed ballots this year to more than 400,000 registered Democrats to get a far larger turnout than the 39,000 who voted four years ago.
ASSOCIATED PRESS In this Sunday, March 15, 2020, photo, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a Democratic presidential primary debate at CNN Studios in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)
The primary determined how 39 of the state’s 45 national convention delegates would be allocated. The remaining six are party leaders, including Gov. Laura Kelly and U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids.
Besides Biden and Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also were on the Kansas ballot. Voters also could choose to be uncommitted.
The contest also featured ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to pick more than one candidate and rank them. A candidate who failed to get 15% in the first round of voting had his or her votes reallocated to voters’ second choices, and the process continued until the only remaining candidates all had at least 15%.
Democratic leaders originally had planned to set up polling places across the state in addition to allowing mail balloting. But they scrapped plans for in-person voting at the end of March after Kelly issued a statewide stay-at-home order.
Many Democrats hoped a smooth primary would encourage greater reliance on mail balloting in Kansas’ regular primary in August and its November general election.""" ;

<https://www.ifex.org/guinea/2014/09/19/journalists_killed/> dct:description """On 17 September 2014 a mob of villagers killed three journalists and six others who were raising awareness about Ebola in Womey, a village about 900 km from Guinea's capital, Conakry.
Facely Camara, who was a journalist with Radio Liberté FM at Nzérékoré (about 50 km from Womey), Molou Chérif and Sidiki Sidibé, who were, respectively, a journalist and a technician at a community radio station in Nzérékoré, were killed while covering a sensitization campaign on preventive measures against Ebola in Womey.
The MFWA's Guinea correspondent reported that locals attacked the team, which comprised local administrators, two medical officers, a preacher, and the three journalists. They pelted the team with stones and attacked them with cutlasses.
Some members of the delegation managed to flee, but nine of them, including three journalists, were kidnapped by the villagers. The villagers brutally killed them in the bush by slitting their throats and then buried them in a mass grave.
According to the correspondent, the villagers instigated this attack because they thought Ebola “is a political lie orchestrated by the authorities and that the disease is not real.” This follows previous riots in Nzérékoré in August after rumours that health officials who were disinfecting a market were infecting people with the virus.
The MFWA's correspondent added that the Union of Free Radio and Television Stations of Guinea, Guinean Association of Private Newspaper Publishers, and Guinean On-Line Media Association have already issued a joint statement condemning this incident.
The Guinean Prime Minister, Mohamed Said Fofana, condemned the massacre in a national address. He promised that the perpetrators will be punished; six people have already been arrested in connection with the incident.
The MFWA is greatly saddened by this development and urges the Guinean Prime Minister to remain true to his words and bring the perpetrators to justice. We urge organisations working with journalists to ensure their safety while reporting on sensitive issues. We also call on the Guinean government and other governments in West Africa to intensify education about Ebola to clear doubts and suspicions people may have about the disease.""" ;

Many of the victims were women and children sleeping when the explosion ripped apart a section of the 500-mile-long (800km) Ocensa pipeline near the gold-mining villages of Machuca and Fraguas in northwest Antioquia Province.
Police blamed the blast on the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group, which only last week started tentative peace talks with the government and independent civic leaders. The incident is likely to be a severe embarrassment to the ELN as it strives to portray itself as a political as well as military movement. It also risks torpedoing the talks to end Colombia's long-running civil conflict, which has claimed at least 35,000 lives in the past decade.
"Survivors say the guerrillas arrived and blew up the pipeline, which caused an explosion, spilt crude and set the whole village alight," Jairo Guerra, a police agent, said.
The Ocensa pipeline is owned and operated by a private British, French and Canadian consortium. The pipeline, which had been pumping about 350,000 barrels of crude per day, serves the Cusiana-Cupiagua complex, which is operated by British Petroleum, in the eastern plains region.

One Red Cross worker is still recovering after suffering a wound to the neck in Tuesday’s attack in the southeastern town of Forecariah, according to Benoit Carpentier, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Resident Mariam Barry told reporters that family members of dead Ebola victims had set upon the six volunteers and vandalised their cars.
A crowd eventually gathered at the regional health office, where they pelted the building with rocks.
The incident comes after a string of attacks on teams attempting to safely bury dead bodies, as corpses not dealt with correctly spread the deadly disease. The officials also aim to provide information about Ebola and disinfect public places.

Last week, eight health workers educating people about the virus and journalists accompanying them were abducted and killed in Guinea were abducted and killed.
And in April, Doctors Without Borders briefly pulled out its team from the Guinean town of Macenta after their clinic was stoned. In Liberia, the homes of some of the infected have been attacked. Last week, Red Cross workers were threatened in Sierra Leone, Carpentier, the Red Cross spokesman, said.
As the disease is new to this part of the world and so relentlessly lethal, people fear outsiders are associated with Ebola, even if they are coming to help, said Meredith Stakem, a health and nutrition adviser for Catholic Relief Services.
She added that people in the affected communities may not be familiar with basic biological concepts of disease transmission, and the spread of Ebola contradicts what they do know.
"There's not a lot of diseases that can be transmitted by corpses," she said. "It's hard for people to comprehend that the dead body is actually a threat."
Ebola is thought to have infected more than 5,800 people across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal.
The outbreak is the largest the world has ever seen, partially because it went undetected for months, began in a highly mobile area and spread to densely populated West African cities.

<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/love-parade-tragedy-ill-never-forget-the-sight-of-all-those-twisted-bodies-2035410.html> dct:description """The organisers of Duisburg's Love Parade were yesterday accused of rejecting safety warnings on cost grounds before a stampede that left 19 revellers dead and injured more than 340 others. Prosecutors opened an official inquiry yesterday into the worst tragedy in the celebrated techno-music event's 21-year history. Among those killed were festival-goers from China, Australia, Italy and Holland.
Moments before the stampede, a huge crowd of some 500,000 festival-goers was making its way from the Rhine city's main railway station through a 300-yard-long tunnel towards the festival site, which was already packed on Saturday with more than a million techno ravers.
Fears that the area would be overwhelmed by the approaching crowd prompted police to seal off the exit to the tunnel and use megaphones to order the revellers to turn back. In the ensuing panic, 19 people were crushed to death. "I will never forget the sight," said one woman festival-goer who was trapped in the tunnel. "There were all these twisted-up bodies of those who had been crushed. They were lying at the tunnel exit," she said. "Their faces had all turned blue."
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines
The thousands rushing through the tunnel were trying to witness the festival's main closing parade, it emerged yesterday. "It was idiotic of the police to try to turn back a crowd of ravers who were hell bent on getting into the festival," complained Jörg Sandmann, 21, a student who was at the back of the tunnel. "Nobody wanted to hear that they couldn't get in. They just surged forward," he said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded an “intensive” investigation into the stampede. Mrs Merkel said she had been “appalled” by the tragedy, adding that everything must be done to ensure such deaths did not happen again.
Germany's Der Spiegel magazine website revealed that the Duisburg police and fire brigade had recruited a team of security experts to carry out a study in the run-up to the festival. The experts concluded it was vital to avoid the kind of "eye of the needle" situation that was created by making the tunnel the only access route to the Love Parade site. They had argued that it was necessary to allow the crowd several access routes. However, the organisers allegedly rejected the experts' suggestions because that would have meant deploying a far larger police force, with higher costs as a result.
Video: 19 dead at Love Parade
Wolfgang Orscheschek, the regional police union deputy head, said the site chosen for the festival was far too small. "The city government was cornered by the organisers to such an extent that, despite the urgent warnings of the security experts, they could only say yes," he said.
Police and Duisburg city officials dodged questions about the causes of the tragedy at a press conference which was described as "chaotic" by several German media outlets present yesterday. Adolf Sauerland, Duisburg's mayor, argued that until the investigation was complete, any apportioning of guilt would be "out of place and out of order".
"That would be an injustice to the victims and their families," he insisted. But despite official stonewalling, the finger of blame was being pointed squarely at the organisers yesterday.

The Love Parade's founder, the techno disc jockey Dr Motte, who had nothing to do with the weekend's Duisburg festival, said in an interview with the Berliner Kurier, that it was scandalous that the crowd had been allowed only one access route to the festival.
Eyewitnesses said chaos broke out at the exit of the tunnel as revellers tried to scale fences, a lighting mast and a concrete stairway at its side whose exit had also been blocked off.
Several of the revellers fell off the stairs into the crowd. Others, pushed by the throng surging towards the exit from behind, simply collapsed on top of them. A stampede ensued, with hundreds of victims trampled in the crush.
"The atmosphere was explosive. Many in the crowd seemed to be intoxicated," said one police officer, who witnessed the scene. "When people started falling off the stairs and pulling others with them, it became just chaotic," he said. "They just couldn't be stopped. It was a living hell."
Police and ambulance crews fought in vain to get to the injured and dead lying at the tunnel exit. Late on Saturday, Duisburg's police chief admitted that the situation was "chaotic".
In order to prevent another panic-induced stampede, the organisers refused to call a halt to the event. The million-strong crowd of ravers was allowed to continue partying well into Saturday evening. Most did not learn of the tragedy until they started leaving.
Yesterday, the floor of Duisburg's "Death Tunnel" was littered with broken spectacles, discarded trainers, torn clothing and bits of medical equipment left by frantic ambulance crews.
As state prosecutors opened an official investigation into the disaster yesterday, Rainer Schaller, the techno festival's organiser, announced that there would be no more Love Parade festivals in Germany under his supervision. "The Love Parade was always a joyful and peaceful party. If it were to continue, it would always be overshadowed by yesterday's events," he said. "Out of respect for the victims, their families and friends, we are going to discontinue the event and that means the end of the Love Parade."
Chris Smith, festival organiser for Womad, held in Wiltshire at the weekend, said he doubted the Love Parade tragedy would be repeated in the UK.
"We take safety incredibly seriously in the UK. I think we have higher standards than anyone else."
Concert tragedies
*Eleven fans of The Who died as almost 10,000 audience members charged to claim seats at a gig in Cincinnati in 1979. The band weren't told of the tragedy until after they had performed.
*Three teenagers died in 1991 when a crowd of almost 5,000 surged forward at an AC/DC concert in Salt Lake City, US.
*Nine people were crushed to death and 43 injured during a Pearl Jam set at the 2000 Roskilde Festival in Denmark.
*In 2001, four teenage girls were killed at an Indonesian shopping centre trying to catch a glimpse of British boy band A1.
*Five people were trampled to death this year after gunfire sparked a stampede at a concert in Mexico.

The suspect, a 13-year old boy, has agreed to the juvenile court version of a guilty plea. The suspect's mother has taken the stand to talk about her son and the guns in their home, and prosecutors have shared new information about the suspect and how the events unfolded that day.
IndyStar is not naming the suspect because he is not being charged as an adult.

Possible consequences: What could be next for the suspect
Here is all of the new information we've learned so far at the hearing:
The day before the shooting
The suspect filmed a nearly two-minute video in his family basement the day before the shooting, revealing a .45-caliber handgun and a .22-caliber handgun with a silencer attached, according to prosecutors. The boy said on the video: "Tomorrow's Friday, you know what that means. I have to take other people's lives before I take my own."
Prosecutors said the boy warned three classmates with text messages that read: "Don't come to school tomorrow."
The boy's mother testified that there are guns in the home, including the two handguns that the boy brought to school. She said the gun safe is in the basement, near where the boy plays first-person shooter games. Prosecutors showed photos of the safe with the keys hanging out of the lock.
The boy's mother said his father taught him about gun safety, and said they are responsible gun owners.
An investigator testified that the boy's internet search history included the terms: "Columbine," "Sandy Hook," "school shooting memes," "what was the largest mass shooting in America," and "Noblesville West Middle School blueprint".
The day of the shooting
The boy's mother said the morning of the shooting was normal, and the boy got ready for school and talked about an upcoming band concert.
According to prosecutors, the seventh-grade boy came to school with weapons in his backpack, put the bag in his locker and went to class.
Prosecutors said during the boy's second period science class with Jason Seaman, students took a quiz on school-issued iPads. The boy finished early, asking to be excused. He went to his locker, got his backpack and headed to the bathroom, where he left the bag.
Prosecutors said Seaman was helping student Ella Whistler with a question about the quiz. Seaman testified that he heard a knock on the classroom door, and non-verbally instructed another student to open the door.
According to prosecutors, the suspect returned to the classroom with weapons hidden in his hooded sweatshirt. The boy entered and fired the .22-caliber handgun, hitting Seaman.
Seaman was holding a small basketball that he "double-pumped," which he said he learned in training. He said he threw it at the boy as hard as he could and went to rush him in a "bear hug."
Prosecutors said the boy kept firing, striking Seaman and Whistler. Seaman said he pinned the boy to the ground, which caused him to drop the weapon. Seaman said he shouted at the other students to "Run, get out of the classroom, call 911."
Seaman testified that he asked the shooter if he had any other weapons, and unloaded another gun and ammunition.
An eighth-grade teacher in the hallway saw the disturbance and called the school office to request a resource officer, said prosecutors. Seaman said the school resource officer entered the classroom with a key, searched the room for other weapons and checked Seaman's wounds.
Seaman said he was shot three times — once in the abdomen, once in the right forearm, and once in the right hip. He was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital, where he underwent surgery.

In this Oct. 18, 2011, file photo, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton checks her Blackberry from a desk inside a C-17 military plane upon her departure from Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, bound for Tripoli, Libya. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque, AP)
WASHINGTON — Indianoplace? Now, that hurts.
Indianapolis has done much in recent years to bolster its image — OK, create an image — with an increasingly thriving Downtown, an award-winning airport, and its penchant for hosting big-time sporting events such as, you know, that little thing they call the Super Bowl.
And, yet, Indianoplace. Yep, that’s how Hillary Clinton referred to us.
"Are you still in basketball-crazed Indianoplace?" Clinton wrote in an email to an aide in 2010, one of the many missives — or maybe we should call them diss-ives — recently released by the U.S. State Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
Suppose we could take some solace in the fact Clinton typed those words five years ago. A campaign spokesman said Clinton "has long loved the Hoosier state and still has fond memories of campaigning there in 2008." And Indiana Democratic Party spokesman Drew Anderson saw something positive in the comment. Then again, he kind of has to. She is, after all, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president.
"I mean, at least she knows we are die-hard hoops fans?" Anderson tweeted.
Then again, she also is apparently hip to Indy’s not-so-hip "noplace" and "naptown" nicknames.
How unhip? The UrbanDictionary.com says "Indianoplace" is generally regarded as a derogatory name for Indianapolis. And then adds this zinger: "Comes from the evident lack of anything to do other than get drunk and watch sports and the apparent resistance of many of its inhabitants to allow culture, change, or diversity into the mix."
Clinton grew up in suburban Chicago and was an Indiana organizer for the Jimmy Carter-Walter Mondale presidential campaign in 1976. But she also got to see Indiana in its more present state when she and Barack Obama competed heavily for Hoosier delegates in the 2008 presidential primary.
She even took a shot of whiskey and drank a beer at Bronko's Restaurant and Lounge in Crown Point during that campaign.
And she was interviewed on "The Bob & Tom Show", a syndicated radio program, while driving to work with a South Bend sheet metal worker.
At the time, she compared her campaign to the "Milan Miracle," the high school basketball team from Milan, Ind., that won the 1954 boys' state championship.
And Hoosiers repaid that effort. Clinton carried Indiana with 51 percent to Obama's 49 percent.
After Obama secured the nomination a month later, he went on to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the basketball-crazed state in more than 40 years. Whether Clinton has the opportunity to repeat that feat remains to be seen.
But a little mea culpa to the Circle City wouldn’t hurt. And, hey, at least she didn't call us Indianans.

<https://www.insidesources.com/n-h-voters-oppose-medicare-for-all-by-2-to-1-margin/> dct:description """As Bernie Sanders campaigns across New Hampshire on behalf of his single-payer healthcare plan, a new poll finds the state’s voters overwhelmingly reject Medicare For All.
New Hampshire voters oppose Medicare For All by a two-to-one margin, and more than half “strongly” oppose it, according to a new poll released by the Coalition Against Socialized Medicine (CASM), a project of the American Conservative Union.
The survey finds likely Granite State voters oppose the signature healthcare measure of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren 65 to 31 percent, and 54 percent say they strongly oppose it. While a slight majority of Democrats (53 percent) support Medicare For All, 85 percent of Republicans oppose it.
Perhaps most significantly for the November election, independent voters overwhelmingly oppose it 66 to 30 percent.”New Hampshire voters are some of the best-educated, politically-astute voters in the country, and they overwhelmingly oppose price controls on prescription drugs and Medicare For All,” said CASM Executive Director Marc Palazzo. “Americans reject socialism and New Hampshire is no different. They’re saying ‘no’ to a radical proposal that puts the quality of their own care at risk.”
The poll of 400 likely general election voters was conducted by McLaughlin and Associates on February 4-5 and has a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percent.
New Hampshire voters rank healthcare as their top issue in the upcoming election — narrowly edging out jobs and the economy — and they are concerned about the potential impact of single-payer healthcare and government regulation on the quality of their care.
Four in five (83 percent) of New Hampshire voters oppose price-control policies if they would lead to the federal government denying access to effective medicines or treatments, also known as “rationing.” The opposition is intense: 70 percent “strongly” oppose it, and the opposition cuts across all demographic groups.
And nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire voters (64 percent) oppose price controls on prescription drugs if they lead to fewer medical breakthroughs and cures, fewer investments and research-based jobs in the United States, and countries like China overtaking the United States as the world leader in biomedical innovation and manufacturing.
“The more voters learn about these policies, the less they support them. New Hampshire has always served as a good litmus test for national politics, said Jim McLaughlin, president and partner of McLaughlin & Associates. “These results show any candidate running on a platform that includes price controls or Medicare for All will have a hard time winning critical swing states necessary to take the Presidency.”
Other key findings:
Voters under 40 are divided over Medicare for All (48 percent support, 47 percent oppose), while voters over 40 clearly oppose the plan 72 to 24 percent. Seniors, who are the most likely group to turn out and vote also show the strongest opposition (76 to 21 percent).
The opposition is stronger among women (69 to 28 percent) than men (61 to 33 percent).
The majority of union households oppose it (59 to 40 percent).
New Hampshire voters reject prescription drug price controls (68 to 22 percent) if the savings could go to the government or health insurers rather than being passed on directly to patients.

Of the registered voters, SurveyUSA identified 929 voters likely to return a ballot on or before the November 03, 2020 deadline. 58% of likely voters tell SurveyUSA they will vote before Election Day. 39% will vote on Election Day. This research was conducted online among a representative cross section of Minnesota adults. Respondents were weighted to US Census targets for gender, age, race, education, and home-ownership. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Minnesota by 1.5 percentage points. In 2020, multiple overlapping forces are at work to limit the predictive value of public opinion polls. The manner, timing, and way in which many voters will mark a ballot in 2020 will differ from previous elections. Whether this makes turnout higher than anticipated, lower than anticipated or unchanged is unknowable. Whether there will be systemic voter fraud, as the President fears, or isolated and insignificant fraud, is unknowable. Whether there will be a smooth transition of power is unknowable.

<https://www.ksl.com/article/50037884/former-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-endorses-rep-ben-mcadams-in-utah-race> dct:description """SALT LAKE CITY — Evan McMullin, a former Republican who ran as an independent candidate for president in 2016, endorsed Utah Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams' reelection Monday and criticized his GOP opponent in the 4th Congressional District race, Burgess Owens, for attracting "a dangerous and divisive type of politics" to the state.
The race between McAdams and Owens is one of the country's closest. A new Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll showed Owens, a former NFL player, author and frequent Fox News guest, ahead by a single percentage point.
McMullin, who finished behind President Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in Utah four years ago with just over 21% of the vote for president, said "Owens has invited a dangerous and divisive type of politics into our state with his lies about Ben McAdams and catering to extremism."
He said "Owens simply doesn't share our values and has no interest in working across party lines for the good of Utah and the country," and urged voters to "put country over party" and back McAdams, "an independent, unifying leader who has worked effectively with both parties to deliver for our state."
McAdams said he appreciates "Evan's endorsement and I am proud to receive the backing of such a dedicated public servant. He and I share the same belief that people come before party, and that we need to bridge divides, not widen them, in order to solve problems."
Owens' campaign responded by listing endorsements he has received from Utah Republicans including gubernatorial nominee Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, outgoing Gov. Gary Herbert, Sen. Mike Lee, Reps John Curtis, Chris Stewart and Rob Bishop, and former Rep. Mia Love, who lost to McAdams two years ago.
Jesse Ranney, Owens' spokesman, said Owens is "honored" to receive endorsements from those on the list "and numerous others who have been serving Utah for decades."
Also endorsing Owens is Trump, whose son, Donald Trump Jr., helped the first-time candidate raise money in Utah.
Both McAdams and McMullin are supporting the Democratic candidate in the presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden.

<https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-11-16-mn-7680-story.html> dct:description """When the tide is low enough, the stumps of old buildings and wharves peek above the waves. They are decaying reminders of the boom town that died a century ago when disaster visited twice.
Repeated storms over the years have pushed the coastline inland several blocks, allowing the sea to swallow the pilings that still stood after the devastating hurricane of 1886.
It was the second hurricane to ravage the bustling port community in 11 years, and the vicious winds took not only lives and property spared by the first storm, but the very spirit of Indianola as well.
“Many thought the end of the world had come. Prayers and hymns rose above the groans of the waves and the wind,” wrote Euroda Moore in a published collection of survivors’ accounts of the ordeal.
Advertisement
“It was a most terrible time,” Alice Reed, another survivor, wrote in a letter. “People fighting against fire, water and wind.”
Fire Followed Flood
The fire--started by a lantern that was smashed when the weather bureau office collapsed in the storm--gutted most of what the tidal surge had left standing.
History books say the population of Indianola once exceeded 6,000, and that its commerce rivaled that of Galveston, “the Wall Street of the Southwest,” about 130 miles up the Texas coastline.
Advertisement
Hundreds of people, along with the town, died in the hurricanes’ double blast. Those who lived fled inland, never to return.
John S. Munn, an attorney in Victoria, said words could not describe the horror:
“As fast as possible after the storm, those who were so fortunate as to be saved deserted the wrecked peninsula,” he wrote in the Jackson County Progress a week after the second hurricane.
“The very thoughts of Indianola will be avoided by those who passed through the valley of the shadow of death there for the remainder of their lives,” he wrote.
Advertisement
Settled by German immigrants in the early 1840s, Indianola was blessed with a naturally deep harbor along Matagorda Bay. In 1849, shipping magnate Charles Morgan made the town a port for his fleet.
Once-Bustling Harbor
Wharves that stretched half a mile into the bay served as a landing for goods to and from Texas, Mexico and California. Wells Fargo Express Co. shipped silver bullion from Mexico, headed for a federal mint in New Orleans, through Indianola.
The first cattle shipment to New Orleans left from Indianola, and all the Army bases in Texas were supplied through the port.
Advertisement
Even camels came through the harbor. In the 1850s, 125 of the beasts of burden arrived for service in the Army.
Stagecoaches left three times weekly for San Antonio, where travelers could make connections to California, 38 dusty days away.
“It was a miracle Indianola got as big as it did,” said George Fred Rhodes, chairman of the Calhoun County Historical Commission. “But they didn’t have any bad storms.”
The town’s luck changed on Sept. 16, 1875, when a hurricane slammed in from the Gulf of Mexico. A report in the Victoria Advocate estimated the winds at nearly 130 m.p.h.
Advertisement
Hundreds of people died as a tidal surge eight feet high submerged the town.
Corpses Littered Shore
“We are destitute,” Dist. Atty. W. H. Crain wrote in a letter he sent via a steamer captain to the Galveston Daily News. “Dead bodies are strewn for 20 miles along the bay. Send us help, for God’s sake!”
The hurricane was the first of several economic setbacks in that year. New tracks between Galveston and San Antonio diverted more ships to Galveston, and rail lines to Indianola were not rebuilt. Leading merchants, fearful of another storm, decided to leave.
Advertisement
Their fears were well-founded.
Aug. 18, 1886, was a cloudy and humid day, although the dark skies at first stirred hope, not fear. The area had been suffering from drought.
At 9:30 p.m., winds reached 36 m.p.h. Six hours later, the wind force had doubled. The wind gauge at the Signal Service, forerunner of the National Weather Service, read 102 m.p.h. when the building collapsed and touched off the fire from a kerosene lantern inside.
“Many people thought the end of the world had come,” one survivor said later. “Fire literally rained out of the sky. The terrific wind tore burning pieces of lumber from the fired houses, and the air was filled with flames and embers.”
Advertisement
County Seat Relocated
This time, Indianola could not recover. Three months after the second storm, residents voted to move the county seat farther inland, to Port Lavaca. The post office was closed in May, 1887. The last passenger train left a month later.
Today, a pink granite marker, battered by wind and waves, tilts precariously in the sand. Another stone stands at a crumbling cistern filled with stinking, stagnant water.
Huddled away from the beach are a few dozen tombstones.

Only about 35 people now live here year-round. A few dozen beach houses dot the coastline. The flat peninsula, still vulnerable to the elements, took 170-m.p.h. gusts from Hurricane Carla in 1961.
“You keep everything ready,” said Phyllis Brown, who has operated a bait stand and cabins just off the beach for 15 years.
“You always worry about it.”""" ;

<https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-edc-rotella-20170928-story.html> dct:description """Next year, for the first time, fans at Electric Daisy Carnival will be able to walk out of the show at sunrise and right into their own air-conditioned tent.
That would have been impossible any other year. Considering late-June temperatures in Las Vegas routinely topped 100 degrees even in the dead of night, the new-for-2018 camping options will likely be a much-welcome relief.
It happened because, next year, the fest is moving up a month, to May 18-20, and it could radically change the entire EDC Las Vegas experience, as organizers hope the shift to May will bring cooler temps.
“I’ve been thinking about it for years,” said Pasquale Rotella, the founder of EDC’s promoter Insomniac. “It’s just been getting hotter and hotter with no breaks. It wasn’t as comfortable as it needed to be.”
Advertisement
The change should help alleviate some of the pressure on the estimated 400,000 fans who attend over the three-night fest (tickets for the 2018 edition are on sale today). The date adjustment is part of perhaps the most serious rethink of the festival’s culture since its move to Las Vegas in 2011.
The move to May is in part a logistical move to help reduce the medical risks that come from partying in such intense heat. EDC has faced criticism over its annual fan deaths, most attributed in part to drug overdoses. A change of temperature may mean the difference between life and death for some fans, and exhaustion or comfort for most.
“Everything helps,” Rotella said. “We have the most innovative medical team in the business, and EDC doesn’t have any more of a problem than any other festival, but I do believe the weather will help people.”
With the date change comes a new on-site camping option, with RVs and pre-constructed turnkey tents expected to draw around 30,000 fans to what Rotella described as “EDC City.”
Advertisement
Coupled with earlier gates-open times and elements like yoga and a speakers series, the camping will bring a new daytime EDC component that the old Nevada heat would never permit.
“I’ve wanted it for a really long time,” Rotella said. “It bring people closer together.”
For fans who buy a camping pass, the annual traffic snarls to and from the strip will be eliminated in favor of a short walk outside the grounds (most fans stay on the Strip or in nearby Vegas rental housing).
An expanded shuttle system from a new private operator may help as well. EDC shuttle lines were famously long and the buses rowdy; construction on the highway out to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway is finally complete as well, and should open up new lanes of traffic.
Advertisement
But EDC is not the only L.A.-adjacent festival that Insomniac will be overseeing.
After the departure of Hard Summer’s Gary Richards to LiveStyle (where he is widely expected to start a new marquee festival), Insomniac now fully operates the Hard brand (both companies were and remain partially or totally owned by Live Nation).
Rotella said Insomniac did some behind-the-scenes work at this year’s 10th anniversary Hard Summer, and expects to keep the brand and festival more-or-less intact in Richards’ absence.
“We’re not going to skip a beat,” Rotella said. “We’re going to focus on music and we’re not really going to change anything about it.”

<https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-chattanooga-shooter-20150722-story.html> dct:description """A Kuwaiti-born U.S. citizen who gunned down five servicemen in Chattanooga, Tenn., appears to have been a “homegrown violent extremist” operating on his own, investigators said Wednesday as they revealed chilling details of how the shooting unfolded.
Officials said they are following hundreds of leads as they search for a motive in the July 16 assault by Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, a 24-year-old who was raised in suburban Chattanooga. Abdulazeez was killed in a gunfight after he had opened fire, and FBI special agent Ed Reinhold told a news conference that he was shot by local police.
Reinhold gave a timeline of the shooting, saying it targeted two sites and began shortly before 11 a.m. local time when Abdulazeez drove to an armed forces recruiting center and fired shots at it from his car. He then proceeded to a joint Marine and Navy reserve center a few miles away.
By then, he said, Chattanooga police were in pursuit but they could not catch up to Abdulazeez before he crashed through the front gate of the reserve center.
Advertisement
Once inside the gate, Reinhold said, Abdulazeez got out of his car armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and “numerous magazines.” One service member spotted him from inside the building and fired. Abdulazeez fired back, then approached the building’s front door, walked inside and “shot the first person he saw,” Reinhold said.
The victim fell, mortally wounded.
“He then made his way through the building, continuing to shoot at those he encountered,” Reinhold said.
Some fled out the back door, and someone apparently fired at Abdulazeez in an attempt to stop him, he said. Among the weapons found inside the facility were two belonging to service members. At least one had been discharged, but officials said they had not determined if anyone was struck by fire from that weapon.
Advertisement
As people fled out the back door, Reinhold said, Abdulazeez went after them and shot to death four in the gated motor pool area. That is where Chattanooga police encountered the shooter and killed him.
Reinhold said the episode -- from the moment Abdulazeez crashed through the gate until he was killed -- lasted three to five minutes.
Unlike some other mass shooters, Abdulazeez appeared to most friends to lead a well-adjusted life absent of outward signs of radicalization. Friends from high school have described him as a popular athlete who did well in classes.
But in the days before the shooting, he had started a blog that equated his life with being in prison, and he praised the most devoted disciples of the prophet Muhammad for waging jihad to establish Islam. Abdulazeez had lost a job in Ohio in 2013, and he was charged with DUI last April.

Reinhold said it was too early to say if Abdulazeez had become a radicalized or if something else led to the attack. The Associated Press reported this week that Abdulazeez’s family said he had suffered from depression.
Reinhold said investigators had heard the same reports and were looking into them.
“At this time, we’re treating him as a home-grown violent extremist,” said Reinhold, who would not give details of what investigators had learned so far from Abdulazeez’s family and friends or from a computer and other items taken from his home. “We believe he acted on his own that day,” Reinhold added. “We don’t have any indication anyone else was assisting him.”
On Monday, a family spokesman told the AP that Abdulazeez was first treated by a child psychiatrist for depression at age 12 or 13. Abdulazeez also battled drug and alcohol abuse, said the family representative, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Relatives tried to have Abdulazeez admitted to an in-patient drug program, the family spokesman said, but their insurance turned down the expense. They also sent him to Jordan for several months in an attempt to get him away from drugs and alcohol, the spokesman said.
Reinhold would not say where Abdulazeez obtained the weapons he used in the attack.
Marine Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier said the troops at the second facility were inspecting their equipment after having returned from a training mission in California. He said troops went from room to room, trying to get others to safety, and that some ran back into the fight as Abdulazeez fired.
“They will be missed but never forgotten,” Brier said of the four Marines and one Navy petty officer who died.

(Image credit: NOAA)
Galveston was known at the end of the 19th Century as the "Jewel of Texas" until the single deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history wiped away much of what had been a booming future. The bustling island community had been the hub of the cotton trade and Texas' largest city. Progress bred complacency though, which became apparent when city officials and residents decided against building a seawall to protect the city. When the category 4 hurricane with estimated 135 mph winds made landfall in the early morning, buildings crumbled under the force of 15-foot-high waves. By late afternoon, the entire island was submerged. An estimated 8,000 people perished. Although the city was successfully rebuilt, it never regained the prosperity that earned it a reputation as the "New York of the south."
Hurricane Katrina - Aug. 29, 2005
The Atlantic storm that began as a category 1 hurricane as it blew across southern Florida wound up being the country's costliest tragedy. Katrina roared into the Louisiana coast with 125 mph sustained winds, causing a storm surge that broke levees that shielded New Orleans from surrounding, higher coastal waters, and leaving 80 percent of the city under water. Katrina killed at least 1,836 people and inflicted damages estimated at around $125 billion.
Dust Bowl - Early 1930's
(Image credit: NOAA)
Prior to the early 1930's, the Great Plains was a farmer's paradise. Rising demands for wheat spurred settlers to plow much of the southern plains' grassy soil to meet this need. The land was eventually exposed to erosion, since grass and tree roots that had held the moist soil in place during dry times were replaced by cash crops. A decade-long drought transformed the loose topsoil into dust, which windstorms swept up and blew eastward, darkening skies as far away as the Atlantic Coast. With most of the areaâ€™s crops decimated, a third of the farmers turned to government aid, while around half a million Americans were left homeless.
Great San Francisco Fire and Earthquake - April 18, 1906

San Francisco residents were abruptly awakened one spring morning by an earthquake that lasted no more than a minute, but set off a chain of events that caused the city to burn for four straight days. The estimated 7.7- to 7.9-magnitude temblor not only broke natural gas mains, which sparked the fires, but also damaged water mains, leaving the fire department with limited resources to battle the blaze. By the time the fires were doused, flames had devoured more than 500 city blocks, and 3,000 lives were lost. Of those who survived, approximately 225,000 people found themselves without a home.
Okeechobee Hurricane - September 16, 1928

When the evacuated residents of Lake Okeechobee learned that a hurricane hadn't arrived on schedule, many returned home thinking that they had been spared. The storm, however, slammed ashore later on the evening of September 16th with sustained 140 mph winds. Such intensity broke a small dike at the lake's south end, resulting in weeks of heavy flooding that claimed at least 2,500 lives.
Heat Wave of 1980 - Summer of 1980

The heat wave of 1980 proved to be one of the nation's most catastrophic prolonged weather events. A high-pressure ridge pushed temperatures across the central and southern United States above 90 degrees Fahrenheit for most of the summer. Agricultural damage tallied an estimated $48 billion due to a massive drought, and 10,000 people died from heat and heat stress-related ailments.

A year-long drought that had ravaged the agricultural economy was further exacerbated by the heat wave of 1988. Damage to the agricultural economy surpassed $61 billion, as total rainfall along the Great Plains region from April through June was even lower than during the Dust Bowl years. Drought conditions seeded wildfires that raged across Yellowstone National Park and Mount Rushmore that summer. Between 5,000 and 10,000 people succumbed to health complications stemming from the sweltering heat.
Johnstown Flood - May 31, 1889
(Image credit: National Park Service)
During the late 19th Century, the small industrial community of Johnstown in Pennsylvania earned a reputation as a producer of high-quality steel. All that progress was flushed away when the poorly maintained South Fork dam that stood high up in the mountains, 14 miles from the city, failed. Days of torrential downpour caused the dam to burst, unleashing more than 20 million tons of water and debris to crash down on the city with the force of Niagara Falls. The flood leveled 1,600 homes and killed 2,209 people.
Peshtigo Fire - October 8, 1871

A lesser-known fire in Wisconsin that burned on the same day as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 turned out to be the nation's deadliest. The drought-stricken city of Peshtigo was set afire when a strong windstorm fueled the spread of a small group of prairie fires by fanning the blaze out over a million acres of forest land. The wildfire even jumped across the Peshtigo River, trapping both sides of the town in flames. By the time the inferno subsided, it had scorched 12 towns and left roughly 1,200 dead.
Tri-State Tornado - March 18, 1925
(Image credit: NOAA)
Over the span of three-and-a-half destructive hours, the Tri-State Tornado became the deadliest twister to rip through the heartland. Along its path "which included Illinois, Indiana, Missouri" the tornado demolished more than 15,000 homes. Of the nearly 700 people killed, 613 were from Illinois. In the aftermath, forecasters started to look into developing a tornado warning system that would have spared many lives at the time.""" ;

On Wednesday afternoon, Erickson, whose name on Snapchat was "devonkillz," appeared in court to face charges in the attack at STEM School Highlands Ranch that left 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo dead.
Erickson kept his head lowered, as his defense attorneys asked the judge to allow them to see the crime scene. His long hair covered his face during most of the hearing. The aspiring actor and musician's hair had shades of fuchsia, purple and orange. He wore dark nail polish.
His friend Aiden Beatty told The Denver Post on Wednesday that Erickson had told him a few weeks ago he had broken up with his girlfriend. His 56-year-old mother, Stephanie Erickson, told The New York Post she didn't know why he had committed the atrocity.
Devon Erickson, 18, and 17-year-old Alec McKinney, a transgender boy born Maya McKinney, are facing charges in school shooting in Colorado.
Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said the suspects used at least two handguns. ABC News' Denver affiliate reported some of the weapons were stolen from Erickson's parents. Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating.
Douglas County prosecutors charged Erickson with one count of first-degree murder and 29 counts of first-degree attempted murder. He is being held without bond. He is set to appear in court again at 1:30 p.m. Friday.

<https://www.local10.com/news/local/miami/ultra-organizers-vow-to-avoid-opening-night-s-nightmarish-exodus> dct:description """MIAMI - The organizers of the Ultra Music Festival pledged to increase shuttle bus services Saturday after thousands of music fans were forced to walk for miles to leave the Virginia Key venue on the festival's opening night.
Ray Martinez, the chief of security for Ultra, said at news conference Saturday that the Rickenbacker Causeway, which connects Virginia Key with Miami's mainland, will have one dedicated lane for bus service starting at 9:30 p.m. On Ultra's first night, buses were restricted to two lanes and started at 1 a.m. The three-day festival ends Sunday.
"We recognize we have to make adjustments and improve," Martinez said.
Ultra said in a statement on Twitter that the problems leaving the festival were unacceptable.
"We look forward to offering you a significantly improved transportation experience today and throughout the weekend, and we appreciate the opportunity to earn back your confidence and trust," the statement read.
Ultra also announced Saturday that organizers would extend activities -- including "secret performances" and art installations -- beyond 2 a.m. in an attempt to avoid all concertgoers leaving at the same time.
It took frustrated festivalgoers hours to leave the island, with some not returning to their hotels until around 4 a.m. They called leaving the festival "nightmarish" and "sh-t show."
Ray Martinez, Ultra's chief of security, addresses reporters Saturday.
This year, the annual electronic music festival moved from downtown Miami to Virginia Key over the objections of local residents, who worried about traffic problems with thousands of people all leaving the barrier island around the same time. The festival typically draws more than 150,000 people each year.
In response, the city barred ride-sharing companies such Uber and Lyft from picking up people leaving the festival in an effort to manage traffic. Instead, festivalgoers were instructed to use shuttle buses to return to the mainland.
However, when the festival ended early Saturday, the number of people leaving far exceeded the capacity of the buses. People decided to walk about 3 miles across the Rickenbacker Causeway, stopping traffic along the bridge.
Uber released a statement on Saturday explaining the traffic rules to concertgoers -- many of whom were unaware that ride-sharing companies were not able to pick them up.
"Having thousands of concert attendees trying to find their Uber in congested, narrow, and low-visibility areas off the Rickenbacker Causeway poses a significant safety risk, which is why we worked with law enforcement and aligned on restricting pickups on Virginia Key," said Javier Correoso, a spokesman for Uber. "We continue to work with event organizers to complement the festival's transportation operation."
Correoso said the rules barring ride-sharing pickups remain in effect Saturday and Sunday, contrary to reports on social media.
Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban Bovo Jr. called the transportation breakdown inexcusable and "a negative stain on our entire community."
"Miami and organizers of Ultra Music Festival must implement a transportation plan that will safely direct pedestrians, reduce heavy traffic off of Virginia Key and prevent risks that could hinder the safety and well-being of festival goers," said Bovo, who is the chairman of the transportation and finance committee for Miami-Dade County.
Kiara Delva, a spokeswoman for the Miami Police Department, said the city has developed a new traffic plan for remaining days of Ultra, which should avoid a repeat of the opening night chaos.
"There are enough buses and methods of transportation to get everyone off of the island safely. We’re asking everyone to exercise patience during this time," Delva said.

A majority of those living in the lowest-income households (80%), those who work part-time (77%) or are not employed (79%), and non-white voters (82%) approve of Governor Baker’s handling of the outbreak. However, these groups are less likely to say they “strongly” approve of Baker’s response.
The coronavirus is top of mind for a majority of voters; 55% call it the most important issue facing state government. Jobs and the economy (22%) is a distant second, and many of the comments mentioning the economy were framed around the question of reopening and the virus. Voters think Baker has handled that balance well. A majority (60%) say the Governor’s plan to reopen the state’s economy has “been about right”. Far fewer think say businesses have opened up too quickly (22%), or not quickly enough (11%).
Overall, 77% of voters hold a favorable view of Baker. By contrast, President Donald Trump remains deeply unpopular in Massachusetts. Two-thirds of voters (67%) have an unfavorable view of the President, about the same as the share who disapprove of his handling of COVID (68%). A majority (55%) “strongly” disapprove of Trump’s handling of the crisis. But Republicans continue to favor the President over the Governor, giving Trump higher marks than Baker for overall favorability (79% versus 63%), and judging both equally on their response to COVID (74% versus 75%).
Looking ahead to the November presidential contest, former Vice President Joe Biden has a commanding lead. A majority of voters (55%) say they would vote for Biden, compared with only 23% who would cast their vote for Trump. Biden’s 32-point lead is 5 points better than Hillary Clinton’s final margin in Massachusetts, consistent with other state and national polls showing Biden outperforming the 2016 nominee. If Biden’s current margin were to hold in November, it would be the largest Democratic victory in Massachusetts since Bill Clinton won the state by 34 points in 1996.
About the poll: These results are based on a survey of 797 Massachusetts registered voters. Responses were collected via online survey interviewing July 17-20,2020. Final survey data was weighted to known and estimated population parameters for the state’s registered voters by age, gender, race, education, geography, and party identification.

The electronic dance music festival, a Miami-born event that has grown into an industry heavyweight and global brand over two decades, has a new contract to stage the three-day event on Virginia Key March 29-31, 2019.
Under the deal approved by Miami commissioners Thursday evening, the festival agreed to pay a guaranteed $2 million to the city under a licensing agreement to hold the three-day event at two locations on Virginia Key — in the park outside the Miami Marine Stadium and in Historic Virginia Key Beach Park.
But in true Miami fashion, the process wasn’t simple. The long discussion, peppered with political bluster, was underscored by controversy stemming from Ultra’s reputation for blasting ear-splitting music and creating traffic problems.
A full day of public comments and debate among commissioners featured hours of objections from Key Biscayne residents who fear huge traffic snarls on the Rickenbacker Causeway — the only road used to get on and off Key Biscayne. Commissioners also heard concerns from environmental activists who worry about loud noise harming wildlife and captive research animals on Virginia Key and frustration from Rapture Electronic Music Festival, a smaller event, that had already made plans to stage a concert that same weekend.

In the end, the concerns outlined in considerable detail seemingly meant little to most of Miami’s elected officials. Most of the debate focused on the money. The original proposal included a minimum $1.4 million fee to the city, possibly more depending on ticket sales. Over hours of discussion, Commissioner Joe Carollo aggressively pushed organizers to bring that payment up to a flat $2 million.
Carollo, in classic form, referenced President Donald Trump while bragging about his negotiation tactics and scolding City Manager Emilio Gonzalez for not squeezing Ultra for more money himself.
“You know what the Donald would say? You’re fired,” he said to Gonzalez.
Commissioners eventually approved the agreement 4-1, with Ken Russell voting no.
Commissioner Keon Hardemon, who sponsored the deal, secured a commitment to dedicate half of the money from the first year toward the effort to build an African American museum in Historic Virginia Key Beach Park — a priority for the city’s only black commissioner and Liberty City native. Virginia Key was a blacks-only beach in the mid-20th century.

Hardemon persistently urged approval, even without the $2 million minimum, saying the city should not pass up the opportunity to help the museum come to fruition.
“This is an opportunity to put a greater amount of dollars in the Virginia Key Trust,” he said.
Hardemon explained that the money will help the Trust convince Miami-Dade County to release about $20 million it has set aside for the construction of the museum. The county has held on to the money while waiting for the Trust to demonstrate it could generate enough revenue to maintain the facility after it’s built.
The Ultra agreement is a revocable licensing agreement with no term, meaning the deal can be revoked about a year before the following festival.
The mayor and multiple councilmembers from Key Biscayne spoke out against the proposal, saying they were disappointed when they first learned about the plan from the Miami Herald instead of a letter or phone call from Miami’s top bureaucrats. After the vote, Village Manager Andrea Agha said even though Ultra is moving into the neighborhood over the village’s objections, she felt like the village will now have open lines of communication with Miami City Hall.
“Our goal is to foster a long-term relationship with the city,” she said.
Miami officials pledged to involve Key Biscayne in decisions related to Ultra in the future, including a review of the event after the March 2019 festival.
Gonzalez said he expects Ultra to honor terms in the contract that call for a full traffic plan and strategy for minimizing environmental impacts.
“We will continue to work with Ultra to ensure that our sacred natural resources are protected and to mitigate any negative impacts to our residents,” he said.
Thursday’s approval marked a quick rebound for the festival that looked to be in dire straits in late September, when commissioners rejected a deal to keep the festival in downtown’s Bayfront Park.
“We’re excited that the commission did approve us to come back to the city of Miami,” said Ray Martinez, Ultra spokesman.
The lone no vote, Russell said he did not hear or see anything from Ultra to convince him its organizers could address the environmental concerns raised earlier in the day.
“That may be able to be addressed, but it hasn’t yet,” he said. “I cannot vote yes for this at this time.”
Researchers from the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science fear the noise will harm research animals kept in the university’s research facility on Virginia Key. In a letter to the city, Dean Roni Avissar said fish in the school’s experimental hatchery could be so agitated by the loud music that they could die trying to escape their tanks by jumping out or kill themselves banging their heads against tank walls.
“The creation of a major concert venue immediately adjacent to this site will severely degrade this facility and its ability to carry out its mission to study marine animals to better understand the factors threatening these species in the wild and to train the next generation of marine scientists,” Avissar wrote.
Ultra representatives disputed the letter’s claims, saying the highest decibel levels will extend only a short distance away from the stage and won’t impact the research facility. Representatives also said heavy-duty barricades would prevent festival-goers from wandering into protected areas on the island.
Ultra is elbowing out Rapture Electronic Music Festival, a smaller but well-regarded event that had been promised the site for its 2019 festival the same weekend. In advocating for commissioners to reject Ultra’s deal, Rapture’s owners asked the city to consider the festival’s track record for protecting Virginia Key’s environment. They said the news of Ultra’s intentions has already had a “chilling effect” on Rapture’s backers, scaring away investors, performers and potential attendees.
“I’m just shocked,” said co-founder Youssef Khamis.
After the vote, Rapture’s attorney said the festival’s organizers would be exploring all legal options. That could include arguing that the city is improperly using a licensing agreement as a way to avoid negotiating a lease, which would require public bidding — a contention raised by downtown residents who successfully got Ultra ousted from Bayfront Park.
No matter what, critical eyes will be fixed on how the 2019 festival goes. Key Biscayne officials expect to be involved in the run-up to the event, including reviewing plans to keep traffic flowing and protect the environment.
Late Thursday, Ultra organizers released a statement touting the move as the beginning of a new chapter for the event.
“The new venue will allow the festival to evolve into its new, larger home, ultimately creating a more enjoyable experience for all festival attendees,” the statement read.""" ;

The Brickell Homeowners Association has sued Miami’s government claiming the city violated its laws by giving Ultra Music Festival a no-bid contract to stage the three-day event on Virginia Key this year.
Ultra is scheduled to open March 29 on the island at two separate locations linked by a barricaded walking path, the lot outside Miami Marine Stadium and a section of Virginia Key Beach Park. In November, Miami commissioners approved a revocable licensing agreement allowing Ultra to move to city-owned property on the key after the commission rejected a new deal for the festival to stay at its longtime home, Bayfront Park — an ouster underscored by downtown neighbors’ complaints and political infighting among commissioners.
The homeowners association, which represents 35,000 people living between the Miami River and the Rickenbacker Causeway, is raising an argument the downtown dwellers had threatened to use if the commissioners let Ultra stay at Bayfront Park. Instead of complaints about the anticipated noise and traffic that will accompany Ultra’s move to Virginia Key, the association is focusing on the city’s legal definition of its agreement with Ultra.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleges that the city is calling its agreement with Ultra a “license” when it is actually a “lease.” The distinction is important because a lease would require the city to open a public bid before awarding a contract. The attorney representing the Brickell homeowners, David Winker, said in a statement that the lawsuit asks the court to “hold the city accountable and force it to follow its own laws regarding competitive bidding and participation of its citizens in the process.”
“The city of Miami circumvented its own laws and disenfranchised its own citizens to force this deal through ... a deal that is a disaster for the environment and our residents,” Winker said.
Winker has been busy suing the city lately. The attorney sued the city twice in the past few months to derail the effort to replace Miami’s only city-owned golf course with a commercial and stadium complex for David Beckham’s upcoming Major League Soccer team.
In 2018, downtown residents raised the same lease versus license issue, using some of the same case law, but never sued. Commissioners eventually rejected a new multi-year contract to keep Ultra on Miami’s downtown waterfront. The city described the Virginia Key deal as a revocable license with no term, meaning the city can decide to cancel the contract with about a year’s notice.

On Thursday morning, Miami City Attorney Victoria Mendez told the Miami Herald her office had not yet received the 10-page complaint, which was first published by blogger Al Crespo.
The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge to stop the electronic dance music festival. When commissioners approved the Virginia Key deal with Ultra, they also displaced another electronic music festival which had been staged on the island the past two years. Rapture Electronic Music Festival had been scheduled to hold its event on the same weekend in Virginia Key Beach Park. Rapture sued Ultra and the city in federal court earlier this year, but a judge threw out the complaint in mid-February.

The fate of Ultra Music Festival’s future in Miami is in the hands of Miami city commissioners, who are expected to soon consider a new five-year contract to keep the three-day electronic dance music event at Bayfront Park.
The vote will be a test of Ultra’s stature and political sway: A worldwide electronic dance music brand that stages its marquee event on Miami’s downtown waterfront needs the votes of four commissioners to stay there. Ultra’s organizers have dumped thousands of dollars into some commissioners’ recent campaigns.
Commissioners were scheduled to vote on the deal at a meeting Thursday. The contract was on the agenda as of Wednesday afternoon. But late Wednesday, representatives from Ultra Music Festival requested the vote be delayed until the next commission meeting on Sept. 27.
For several months, downtown residents who have grown increasingly frustrated with the noise and traffic that accompany the three-day concert hope commissioners will reject the contract and force Ultra to relocate. The residents of condo towers that have sprung up in the last decade want to have fewer large-scale events occupying Bayfront Park because the number of days the park has been closed off for events has more than tripled from 35 in 2011 to 115 in 2017.
Apart from the complaints over Ultra’s impact, an attorney representing a group of neighbors also claims the city is breaking its own rules by not holding an open bid for the use of Bayfront Park. The legal argument focuses on the difference between a “license” and a “lease,” which could set the stage for a legal challenge should commissioners approve a contract.

The proposed five-year contract has an option for a five-year renewal and guarantees the agency that manages Bayfront Park a minimum of $2 million each year from Ultra — more than double what the festival pays the city now. Depending on ticket sales, that number could increase.
The length of the proposed contract necessitates approval from the City Commission. Multiple commissioners have received political contributions from Ultra and related corporations.
Among them is Commissioner Joe Carollo, who doubles as the chairman of the agency that manages the park, the Bayfront Park Management Trust. Carollo helped negotiate the terms of the proposed deal this summer.
When Carollo won the District 3 seat last November, he had received $12,000 from Ultra entities. Organizers also hired Tania Cruz, an attorney who represented Carollo when his election was challenged, as a lobbyist.
Ray Martinez, the former Miami Beach police chief who serves as security director and lobbyist for the festival, said Cruz was not principal negotiator during contract talks, but she was hired to “facilitate the meeting process” with Carollo.

Carollo was miffed at the suggestion Ultra needed help getting a meeting with him. He said campaign dollars will not sway his approach to working out a deal with the festival.
“They don’t have a right to think that because of that contribution that I’m going to vote their way,” he said.
On the hiring of Cruz, Carollo said it was “absurd” to think Ultra needed help to access him.
“Nobody needs to hire anybody to start any conversation with me. They’ve been able to speak to me directly,” he said. “They’ve hired people for the sole purpose of thinking that they can get votes.”
Another beneficiary of Ultra’s political support: Commissioner Manolo Reyes. He received $5,000 during his 2017 campaign. Because he is finishing a term vacated by Mayor Francis Suarez, he is up for re-election in 2019. For that bid, Ultra corporations have already given him another $8,000.
On Wednesday, Reyes told the Miami Herald he is not beholden to any of his contributors.
“Anybody who contributes to my campaign, they know that there’s not strings attached,” he said. “Nobody controls me with a contribution. I vote my conscience.”
Reyes did not share his vote on the contract. He would say only that he has met with downtown residents and will speak on the topic during discussion Thursday.
Commissioner Ken Russell, whose district includes downtown, received $3,000 from Ultra entities in 2015 after defying predictions and making the runoff. During his brief bid for Congress earlier this year — he dropped out of the race — Ultra’s top attorney gave him $2,610.
Ultra officials have not met with Russell in at least a month, the commissioner said. He reiterated a stance he took earlier this year, that the Trust should be deciding on this contract before the commission weighs in.
“The Bayfront Park trust should be vetting this first,” he said. “It should not be decided on its own but rather in the context of the hundred plus events that they run per year. “
When the contract is considered, commissioners will debate the agreement and hear from angry downtown dwellers who would rather see the festival kicked out. An attorney representing some of those residents sent a letter to the city Wednesday outlining a new argument against allowing the commission to approve the proposed contract.
Commissioners are considering waiving public bidding to allow Ultra to have a “license” to remain in Bayfront Park. Four of the five commissioners need to approve the waiver. But attorney Sam Dubbin cites Miami’s charter when he argues the city should be using an open bidding process to grant a “lease” to the best bidder for use of the park. That process involves land appraisals and a discussion of fair market rent for the lease.
Dubbin contends that case law bolsters his position that Miami should not give Ultra a contract without public bidding.
“There is simply no legal way for this commission to approve the proposed Ultra agreement until the city conducts a proper competitive bidding process, obtains the necessary appraisals, ensures a return of fair market value to the city and meets the other protections for the public set forth in the charter,” Dubbin wrote.""" ;

<https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article219114005.html> dct:description """In a surprise move, the Miami City Commission on Thursday unanimously voted down a contract for Ultra Music Festival to stay in Bayfront Park.
Caught in the fray of a political grudge match between two commissioners and mixed public opinion, Ultra Music Festival’s future in downtown Miami was dealt a significant setback when commissioners rejected the contract. Downtown residents who oppose the festival left City Hall smiling and high-fiving each other as festival organizers quietly conferred outside the commission chambers.
The vote could mean that Ultra won’t return to the park in 2019, which would be the first time in 18 years that Ultra is not on Miami’s waterfront. But organizers of the electronic dance music festival said afterward that they hope to salvage a concert at Bayfront Park in March.
A contract could come back later if an agreement could be worked out, an option that seems unlikely to an organized group of residents who were elated with the vote.
“Is there a world where we could work something out that we could live with? I don’t see it today,” said Kenneth Schwartz, who wore a white hat emblazoned with “Save Bayfront Park” in green letters.

Ray Martinez, the former Miami Beach police chief who serves as Ultra’s head of security and spokesman, told the Miami Herald that despite the setback, the festival still wants to try to stay on Miami’s waterfront.
“We’re disappointed, obviously. We’re going to meet again with the city and hopefully be able to resolve the outstanding issues and the issues that the residents have, and be able to come back to the city with an acceptable agreement that they would be ready to vote on.”
Martinez said the vote did not mark the end of Ultra in Bayfront Park.
“We’ve been around for 20 years, and we’re a big part of this city. I think the city recognizes this as well,” he said. “It’s certainly a little bit of a setback, but we continue to move forward. We know we have work to do, but we’re looking to hosting a great festival in 2019.”

Ultra could also negotiate with another venue, such as Hard Rock Stadium, where the Rolling Loud music festival moved after it ran into the same opposition from downtown residents.
Martinez said he did not want to comment about any alternative plans Ultra has.
People who live near the waterfront park are the main opposition to holding music festivals downtown because of the noise and traffic they bring and because Bayfront Park may be closed to the public for several weeks before and after the festival.
Commissioner Joe Carollo, who heads Bayfront Trust, which operates the park, had negotiated an agreement with representatives of Ultra and neighbors — though he said Thursday that the neighbors should have been more involved. Surprisingly, when it came up for a vote, Carollo said he could not support it.
His comments sparked a furor, especially from Commissioner Ken Russell, whose district includes downtown. Tensions that have brewed between Carollo and Russell for months over the management of Bayfront Park boiled over before the Ultra vote as Russell questioned Carollo’s logic in negotiating a contract he couldn’t support and Carollo angrily snapped at Russell. Carollo, red-faced and blustery, defended his deal-making prowess and insulted Russell’s history as a yo-yo salesman. At one point, when Russell said he still couldn’t understand Carollo’s lack of support for the contract he negotiated, Carollo lost his temper.
“You must be hard of hearing, too,” Carollo barked at Russell. Several people in the chamber gasped.
Once the elected officials cut through the contentious debate, all five commissioners opposed the proposed contract. Residents said they didn’t think it was likely Ultra could offer terms that neighbors could support. Ultra representatives were more optimistic, though it was clear they would have to work closely with neighbors to please them before offering another contract.
It’s unclear if that can happen fast enough for Ultra Music Festival to be staged in Bayfront Park in March.
For most of Thursday morning’s public comment period, a stream of downtown residents talked about the ear-splitting noise that booms out from Ultra Music Festival and how it keeps them up at night as it sends vibrations humming through their buildings — literally causing their plates to rattle.
But several business owners said Ultra is a major business weekend for them. From bars to print shops that produce signs for the festival, people argued that Ultra’s economic impact is substantial not only for hotels who lodge tens of thousands across the county — even as far as Doral and Sunny Isles Beach — but for smaller proprietors in downtown.
“To me, events like this are essential,” said Richard Huggins, owner of KopiKats print shop on Southeast First Street.
Sam Dubbin, an attorney representing a group of downtown residents who want to stop large-scale events in Bayfront Park, said the downtown dwellers hope Thursday’s vote will signal a new philosophy on how the park is used.
“We hope it is a turning point in ensuring that Bayfront Park will be a park for all to enjoy and no longer a platform for mega events and private profits,” Dubbin said.""" ;

Just when it looked like that union might be permanently broken, Miami’s politicians and administrators might try to patch things up: Commissioners on June 27 will consider bringing the three-day electronic dance music event back to its longtime home at Bayfront Park. The proposal, sponsored by Commissioner Keon Hardemon, is expected to pit pro-Ultra commissioners and administrators, who argue for the festival’s economic impact, against neighbors who were happy to be rid of the festival’s booming music.
If three of five commissioners approve, Ultra would cap a whirlwind 12 months of angst and anger with a homecoming to the waterfront venue organizers never wanted to leave. In September, the city kicked the festival out of Bayfront and over to Virginia Key, forcing organizers to quickly stage a massive event while creating environmental and logistical concerns. After an uneven weekend beset by transportation issues and complaints from residents of mainland Miami, Ultra’s frustrated executives said they were pulling out of Miami and began talks with other cities who wanted to host them.
Several South Florida cities including Hialeah and Homestead made proposals. But by then some Miami commissioners were having second thoughts about the split, most notably Hardemon, and publicly shared their thoughts about losing Ultra. Other commissioners welcomed a reconsideration, sparking new negotiations with festival organizers.
Ultra representatives declined to comment on the proposal.

Even the thought of Miami administrators talking to the festival again hit some downtown residents harder than one of Ultra’s famous beat drops. The same group of neighbors who cheered when the event left were shocked and immediately objected. Condo dwellers have for years bristled at Ultra’s presence downtown, demanding concessions or the festival’s departure on multiple occasions. Despite outcry from some prominent politicians over the years, Ultra survived each controversy over the course of its nearly two decades on Miami’s downtown waterfront — a burgeoning neighborhood that grew over that same time period.
It was a poisonous mix of political feuding and persistent resident outcry that got Ultra booted in a stunning unanimous vote. Nine months later, the debate looks to get loud again.
“No to Ultra at Bayfront Park! This resolution, unveiled literally in the dead of night, is a slap in the face!” said Amal Kabbani, president of the Downtown Neighbors Alliance, in a statement. “Not only is the City DISMISSING the health risks to residents caused by the Noise from Ultra — a fact the city is well aware of — it is now also asking every single tax payer in the city of Miami to pay for the security of this event. This deal is even worse than the one the city commission unanimously rejected last September.”
So goes the story of a tourism-driven city struggling with the inconveniences of large-scale events.

Next week, commissioners will weigh a new licensing agreement that would return Ultra to Bayfront Park on a year-to-year basis with one significant caveat — revoking the agreement would require a unanimous commission vote. After the 2020 event, which could be held on any weekend in March, the commission would have 60 days after each year’s event to consider canceling the deal.
According to the terms outlined in the proposed agreement, Ultra would pay the city a minimum $2 million to stage its event in the waterfront space while agreeing to occupy Bayfront for only a month, abbreviating a previously longer timeframe the festival had to set up and tear down its stages.
The terms would allow Ultra to close off Bayfront Park entirely for only 14 days. Portions of the park would remain open to the public for the rest of the month. Among downtown dwellers’ top complaints about Ultra: The festival was allowed to close all or part of the park for too long, about two months in recent years.
Ticket surcharges are included in the overall use fee, and if the total surcharge collection adds up to more than $2 million, the city would be entitled to the greater amount. If the agreement were to last three years, the $2 million minimum would increase 3 percent in the third year and continue to increase annually.
City Manager Emilio Gonzalez said the city might net less money because it would absorb up to $1 million worth of police and fire costs during the event, but he reiterated that he sees a greater value in bolstering downtown’s businesses with festivalgoers. Up to 55,000 people would be allowed to attend Ultra, although that number could increase with city approval.
“The net income might not be as much, but UItra’s economic impact outweighs any income the city might get,” said Gonzalez, a vocal supporter of bringing back the festival.
Ultra still owes the city payment from this year’s festival on Virginia Key for fire and police services, waste disposal and taxes, according to the proposed language. If the deal is approved, Ultra would have until July 15 to pay or reach a resolution with the city.
The proposal allows Ultra to operate from 4 p.m. to midnight Friday, noon to midnight Saturday and noon to 11 p.m. Sunday.
Since commissioners suggested in late May that Gonzalez call Ultra executives, the administration has worked to mend broken ties. Miami’s relationship with Ultra weakened in September when commissioners ousted the festival from the park amid a morass of political infighting and aggravation from neighbors’ complaints over lack of access to the park and the festival’s loud, thumping music. Then the hastily arranged replacement venues on Virginia Key created new logistical problems and citizen complaints. Ultra left Miami and courted offers from the Homestead-Miami Speedway, among other local venues.
In November, Hardemon touted Ultra’s move to Virginia Key as a boon for the long-delayed civil rights museum on the island. Virginia Key has the only beach in Miami-Dade County that permitted black Miamians in the time of segregation.
The trust that manages Virginia Key’s public space has sought revenue to support the operation of the planned facility, which would feature the history of the beach and its significance to the community. Ultra gave the trust $1 million as part of its fee for using the island this year. Miami commissioners recently pledged to support the museum’s operations in order to convince Miami-Dade to unlock $20.5 million it has allocated toward the museum’s construction.
The city’s support for the museum would again flow from Ultra’s fee under the new agreement, Gonzalez said. Administrators would earmark some percentage of the city’s $1 million net for the facility.
Ultra’s last tenure at Bayfront Park ended when Commissioner Joe Carollo, chairman of a semi-autonomous agency that manages Miami’s downtown waterfront parks, negotiated and presented a multi-year contract to commissioners. Then Carollo said he opposed the provisions he had negotiated, and the commission unanimously rejected the deal. In the past, the agency had approved Ultra’s agreements to use the park.
The new proposal is going straight to the commission as a revocable licensing agreement sponsored by Hardemon, which could set the stage for a new political dispute. The event would take place on land managed by the Bayfront Park Management Trust, the agency Carollo chairs. The park is also in the district represented by Commissioner Ken Russell, who is running for re-election this year.""" ;

-
The 2020 Ultra Music Festival will be postponed — possibly for a full year, which would effectively cancel this year’s edition of Miami’s marquee electronic dance music event, the Miami Herald has learned.
The decision to postpone, which sent shock waves through the electronic dance music community on social media, was made in a meeting Wednesday morning between Miami’s elected leaders and Ultra representatives, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Before the meeting, Mayor Francis Suarez and Commissioner Joe Carollo told reporters they wanted to postpone the event due to concerns over the spread of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.
City officials have yet to announce details of the change because attorneys are ironing out the legal issues tied to the decision, including the length of the delay, sources said.
Wednesday morning, Suarez, Carollo and City Manager Art Noriega met with Ultra representatives to discuss the possibility of postponing the three-day event, which is scheduled to open March 20 at Bayfront Park. The meeting followed a press conference where Carollo and Suarez called for the event’s postponement. After the meeting, Carollo and Suarez told reporters they had reached a resolution, but there would not be an official announcement until Friday morning.

“The decision was made to postpone it,” Commissioner Manolo Reyes told the Herald, shortly after Suarez briefed him on the meeting. Reyes also signaled that the city will likely look at postponing another large event on the city’s March calendar.
“I agreed with the decision to postpone it,” Reyes said. “And now I’m worried about the Calle Ocho Festival.”
Sources with knowledge of the deal told the Herald that Ultra and the city intend to postpone the event until 2021, effectively nixing the 2020 event. The move would mark the first time in the festival’s 21-year history that Ultra will not produce an event in the greater Miami area.
But Noriega did not address the details of the deal because the city’s legal team and Ultra are still drafting language for a new agreement.
“We’re working on a plan with them, and I’ll formally announce it on Friday,” Noriega told the Herald. “The devil’s in the details. I haven’t seen the actual draft of the agreement.”
The lack of clarity after the private meeting caused ticket holders to wonder if the event would go on or not. Critics furiously weighed in on social media, lambasting the city for overreacting and suggesting the festival could affect the spread of coronavirus. Others said postponement or cancellation made sense. Many pointed out that fans booked flights and hotels way in advance, so they are likely to come to Miami anyway.
Stupid. Everyone will be in Miami regardless since everything is already booked and paid for. Plus there are tons of Miami Music Week parties going on. Are they going to try to just cancel everything? https://t.co/T0NcsUVdlj — Greg (@Gregsy) March 4, 2020
Criticism of those saying it might be a bad idea to play it by ear and possibly cancel this later is sheerly, utterly stupid and shortsighted. Lots of companies and people are pulling out of SXSW. Only a total moron would suggest we keep Ultra 100% on and import this virus. — Omar Ghaffar (@twittetrader) March 4, 2020
Why wait til Friday? Thousands of attendees still have flights and hotels to worry about. Ridiculous. Tie up loose ends over late lunch and announce — jon (@brownbearonice) March 4, 2020
On Twitter, the reaction was swift and divided after news of the cancellation.
“Wow my whole year is now ruined,” tweeted one user named Arabella Macapagal.
“Better to be safe,” wrote Suzanne Maresca. “People come from around the world. This sucks but is a smart decision.”
Wednesday morning, Carollo and Suarez — who have had heated political feuds in the past — stood side-by-side to announce that they wanted to see Ultra postponed.
“We’re saying suspend it to a later date when we’ll have a better idea of where we’re heading with the coronavirus,” said Carollo, emphasizing that the city does not want to outright cancel the event.
Suarez said that Ultra presents a unique challenge in that people come from abroad to attend the festival, which has a capacity of 55,000 per day. The mayor said residents have asked the city to consider postponing or canceling Ultra.
“I can tell you that just in the last 24 hours, I have received countless emails and messages of all kinds urging the city to act,” Suarez said. “That is another major motivator to have this conversation before it gets too late.”
Suarez had said if Ultra did not agree to postponing the event, the city has the power to cancel the event under the existing contract.

An Ultra representative walking into City Hall declined to comment on the possibility of postponement before the meeting, saying the organizers would provide a statement after the meeting. As of 7 p.m. Wednesday, Ultra had not responded to the Herald’s request.
It is unclear how the decision will impact ticket holders.

Ultra, a major live music event in Miami that has been produced annually for more than 20 years, was scheduled to return to Bayfront Park after one year on Virginia Key. Residents’ complaints over noise and limited access to the park, along with political feuds, have framed the controversy around Ultra’s future in the city’s public spaces — at one point last year, it appeared that the festival might move to Homestead after logistical issues plagued the Virginia Key event.
After commissioners expressed second thoughts about booting the event from Bayfront Park in 2018, they approved a new licensing agreement in 2019 for the festival to stage its 2020 festival on downtown’s waterfront again.
Ultra’s brand stretches across the world, with events on multiple continents. In the last week, Ultra’s event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was canceled by local organizers.
Noriega said the city and Ultra need to reach a final agreement on how to proceed by Friday because festival organizers would otherwise be closing Bayfront Park to set up the stages.

When Miami commissioners approved a deal for Ultra to stage its festival outside the Miami Marine Stadium and in Virginia Key Beach Park, they displaced Rapture Electronic Music Festival, which has been held in the beach park for two years and was already on the calendar for the same weekend this year. The venue change followed Ultra’s ouster from Bayfront Park last year when neighbors complained about noise and the amount of time the music festival and large events occupied the park.
Rapture was booked at Virginia Key March 29-30, two of the three days Ultra now plans to move in. Despite objections from Rapture’s organizers at a meeting in November, four of the five commissioners approved a licensing agreement to give Ultra the same weekend.
Now, an attorney for Rapture has sent Ultra and the city a cease and desist letter demanding Ultra stop applying for permits or risk a lawsuit.

“We are investigating this matter further and if [you] do not immediately withdraw your application that directly interferes with our client’s planned festival time and location, we will be taking immediate action against you, the City and Virginia Key Beach Park Trust,” reads the letter from Rapture’s attorney, Paul K. Silverberg. “Any continued behavior and furtherance of the complained act will be considered willful and subject you to punitive damages.”
Silverberg contends the city had an understanding and ongoing relationship with Rapture to keep the event on Virginia Key for three more years.
“There are a number of government employees, who have already stated that Rapture was scheduled for that timing and that you knew — just like others in the city, Virginia Key Beach Park Trust and parks department,” Silverberg wrote.
Miami City Attorney Victoria Mendez and Ultra spokesman Ray Martinez declined to comment on the letter.
Meanwhile, Ultra organizers have applied for permits and drafted plans for managing the festival’s impact on the environment and traffic. Completed traffic and environmental management plans are due to the city by Jan. 28, 60 days before the festival, under the licensing agreement approved in November. The festival is scheduled for March 29-31.

Critics of the plan to move Ultra to the island fear the three-day event will create a traffic nightmare on the causeway and disturb the sensitive environment on and around the island. Festival organizers are required to develop plans for how they intend to move people on and off the island and minimize the impact on the environment.
Documents submitted to environmental regulators and city staff show Ultra wants to shuttle concertgoers to and from Virginia Key on buses running on the Rickenbacker Causeway and water taxis, replicating an approach taken by the Miami International Boat Show to manage the mass of people that will descend on the island for the event. The daily attendance for the event could be about 40,000 — the size of Ultra’s crowd at Bayfront Park — though there could be a drop in attendance because of the venue change.
Martinez told the Miami Herald the festival will provide handicap parking, but festival goers will otherwise be brought to the event on multiple buses and water taxis. The number of buses, their departure points and the launch points for water taxis have not been finalized.
“We are still sourcing vessels,” Martinez said. “And the number of water taxis and launch location has not been finalized yet.”
Public records show the festival is considering launching water taxis from Watson Island. Ultra needs a permit from Miami-Dade’s Division of Environmental Resources Management to construct a temporary dock at the Marine Stadium to accommodate the water taxis. Organizers will also need to provide plans for how to keep people out of protected wetlands, how to keep manatees safe and how to control pollution. Martinez said Ultra has contracted Cardno, a global infrastructure and environmental services company, to craft a plan.
Environmental groups are watching closely. Before November’s vote, University of Miami scientists raised concerns about the impact Ultra’s booming bass might have on research fish at the school’s facility on Virginia Key. Activists have also warned the noise might affect birds during nesting season and manatees.
Government leaders from the village of Key Biscayne were among the loudest objectors to Ultra’s move to Virginia Key when the possibility was first reported by the Herald. The Rickenbacker Causeway is the only road to Key Biscayne, leading to worries that traffic snarls will trap residents. Since the vote, Village Manager Andrea Agha said Miami City Hall and the festival have included the village in planning discussions and listened to the village’s feedback. She said Ultra was tweaking traffic plans specifically because of comments by Key Biscayne leaders.
“There’s been a lot of communication,” she said. “We’re developing a good working relationship. I think time is of the essence here for everyone.”""" ;

“In today’s latest segment of UM doing weird nerd stuff,” one critic posted on Twitter.
But it turns out ocean noise pollution is not just nerd stuff and, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it’s becoming a chronic problem for marine life.
In 2016, the agency adopted a 10-year plan to deal with increasingly noisy U.S. waters, where the whir of boat engines, underwater construction, drilling and other activities are interfering with the ability of marine life, including manatees, dolphins, reef fish and shrimp, to locate food, escape predators and even find love.
So it’s not just research fish that could suffer from the thundering EDM.

Virginia Key provides a rare wildlife sanctuary in the heart of urban Miami long targeted by conservationists for protection. The 860-acre island holds nesting habitat for endangered sea turtles, crocodiles and seabirds and borders the Bill Sadowski Critical Wildlfe Area created in 1990 after speedboat racing ended at the marine stadium. Today all boats, even kayaks, are banned to protect seagrass pastures for grazing manatees.
“If it’s so disruptive to homeowners in downtown and all the way to Brickell — behind hurricane glass — that they voted not to have [the festival] in their community anymore, imagine how disruptive it’s going to be to wildlife,” said Miami Waterkeeper executive director Rachel Silverstein. “This is an area that is supposed to be set aside for wildlife.”

Miami city commissioners agreed last week to move the festival from its 18-year home at Bayfront Park amid mounting complaints about noise and traffic from downtown’s growing condo community. Non-fans say the three-day festival, which attracts about 40,000 fans a day to hear acts like the Chainsmokers, Crystal Method and Tiësto, now triggers an annual exodus of downtown dwellers.
Organizers have said that they will work with environmental regulators and that loud music will not reach UM’s research tanks, housed about 1,200 feet from the beachfront park, one of two locations on the Key approved for stages.

Under the contract, music is limited to 110 decibels within 60 feet of each stage. Where the loudest sounds will be heard depends on the number of stages and how they are oriented. Organizers said they expect to erect more stages in the parking lot outside Miami Marine Stadium than along the beach.
But because water amplifies sound, Roni Avissar, dean of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, warned that noise could be louder when it enters the tanks: 110 decibels equals about 172 decibels in water. That’s louder than a jet engine and loud enough to break glass.

The festival also coincides with spawning season for cobia, mahi mahi, yellowfin tuna and other research fish. The school has spent years breeding the fish to develop a specific genetic broodstock, Rosenstiel marine biologist Martin Grossell said in an email, and damage to the fish could jeopardize research efforts, which helped seal a $19 billion settlement after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. At least $4.2 million in research grants could also be lost.
“Success is directly related to the well-being of the broodstock, which takes three to four years to develop,” he said.
It also comes at a vulnerable time for the university’s hatchery lab. Before Hurricane Irma, many of the fish were moved to Rosenstiel’s reinforced hurricane surge tank, normally used to test the ferocity of hurricane waves, to protect them. The lab itself suffered significant damage, he said. Coming so soon after, the booming music could do long-term damage to the fish. In the short term, they worry it could literally startle them to death, causing the fish to slam into the sides of tanks or jump out in an effort to escape the sound.
“If humans are disturbed, it is highly likely the animals are, and the animals tend to have less capacity and resilience to cope with the disturbance due to a whole host of other, mainly human-caused stressors and threats,” said Canadian biologist Linda Weilgart, who compiled a 2018 Oceancare report that looked at research on ocean noise from 115 studies.

To determine the precise impacts, scientists would need to calculate the angle that noise enters water, distance and decibel, she said in an email.
“The point is how far these tanks are from the source of the sound,” the speakers, she said. “I can’t really say, other than it is a really loud sound.”
While NOAA considers “behavioral harassment” to begin at about 120 decibels, the agency doesn’t yet have a uniform threshold, partly because sound could affect species differently. How different sounds come together or cause fish to react differently is also not well understood. The ocean is plenty noisy, but scientists believe increasing man-made noises are causing a masking effect that interfere with how fish live and behave.
The most well-documented cases involve military sonar on dolphins and whales. In 2000, a half dozen whales and dozens of other mammals, some with bleeding ears, beached themselves near Abaco Island. In 2005, 34 difference species of whales beached themselves in North Carolina following military testing. Last year, the U.S. Navy agreed to limit sonar and explosions along the southeastern coast to help protect endangered North Atlantic right whales.
Lab tests have also shown effects can be profound on fish, including internal injuries, hearing loss and death, according to Weilgart’s report. Scallop larvae blasted by seismic airguns suffered from developmental delays and deformed bodies. Sea hare larvae exposed to ship noise also suffered developmental delays while Atlantic cod larvae had smaller bodies. Boat noise also disoriented baby reef fish, which could impede their ability to make it safely to reefs for food and shelter.
Animals also showed more aggression, ate and courted less, and produced fewer eggs. Studies also found that catches in noisy areas declined, with larger fish leaving the area, the study said.

Silverstein also worries the concert could coincide with bird nesting season and that loud music would cause birds to flee nests with chicks or eggs. Research also suggests it could affect how manatees move through the area, she said.
“They’ve already had a catastrophic year because of the red tides and further impeding reproduction and recovery, and disturbing these marine animals, is further harm,” she said.
Members of the Virginia Key Beach Trust, the semi-autonomous city agency that manages the park, also raised concerns at a meeting this week. The Trust has worked to preserve the historic park, including eliminating invasive vegetation and restoring native species.
“The natural character of the island has always been one of its assets,” said Gene Tinnie, chairman of the board.
Before the March concert, Ultra must obtain any required permits. As of Friday, county and state environmental agencies said they had not yet received any applications.""" ;

Still, it wasn’t enough to flip the state red, as former Vice President Joe Biden looked set to win Minnesota’s ten electoral votes with a seven point edge over Trump as of publication, with some votes yet to be counted. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Minnesota by just 1.5 points.
On Wednesday morning, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon estimated turnout in the election could hit 78 percent — which would be three points higher than turnout in the last presidential go-around in 2016.
Biden and Trump both received more votes in every region of the state — Greater Minnesota, the Twin Cities and the Twin Cities suburbs — than their 2016 equivalents: in Trump’s case, himself, and in Biden’s, Clinton. But Biden’s victory was driven by earning far more votes than Clinton did in each of those places.

The suburbs propelled Biden to victory in Minnesota
As in 2016, the Democrat’s victory relied heavily on running up vote margins in the Twin Cities suburbs. (For the purposes of this piece, we define the suburbs as the seven-county metro region of Anoka, Dakota, Carver, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington minus Minneapolis and St. Paul.) As Greater Minnesota turns more solidly Republican and Minneapolis and St. Paul consistently turn out for Democrats, the Twin Cities suburbs, where 45 percent of votes for president in the state came from Tuesday night, represent the biggest pocket of voters up for grabs for either party.
In recent years, or so the story goes, President Donald Trump’s unpopularity in the Twin Cities suburbs has helped Democrats win statewide, from Hillary Clinton in 2016 to Tim Walz and Keith Ellison in 2018.
Tuesday night appeared to be no exception. Maps of election returns show Biden pushing further out into suburban precincts than Clinton was able to do in 2016.

Not only was turnout higher in the suburbs than it was in 2016, Biden won more of the votes there than Clinton did.
In 2016, Clinton won 49 percent of suburban votes, compared to 57 percent of the suburban votes Biden has so far.
Biden didn’t only do better than Clinton in the suburbs, he did less poorly than Clinton in Greater Minnesota (defined here as the 80 counties outside the seven-county Twin Cities metro).
Clinton won only 35 percent of votes in Greater Minnesota, while Biden, who still lost the 80 counties outside the Twin Cities metro, had 39 percent of the vote as of Wednesday morning’s returns, widening his advantage over Clinton in that part of the state as well.

Suburban vote share growing?
We won’t know for sure yet until all the votes are counted, but this may be the year that the Twin Cities suburbs usurp Greater Minnesota as a voting bloc in a Minnesota presidential election.
As their populations have grown, the ‘burbs have been on a slow climb in clout. In 2016, Greater Minnesota made up 44.1 percent of votes compared to 43.7 in the suburbs. This year, again with a few straggling precincts and whatever comes in in the next week still out, Greater Minnesota represents 42.9 percent of votes cast in the presidential race compared to 45.0 percent of votes in the suburbs.

So far, Minneapolis and St. Paul together represent 12 percent of votes, consistent with their share in the past.
Of course, the increasingly large suburbs have been a boon for Democrats in recent elections but experts caution against believing that’s a long-term trend. Suburbs are notoriously swingy and it wasn’t long ago that Republicans were racking up more votes in the suburban Twin Cities than Democrats. Furthermore, as things stand, Republicans look to be winning back some of the state legislative seats they lost in the suburbs in recent years.""" ;

After a 2016 election in which Trump and Republicans surged across Greater Minnesota, here’s what we learned from outstate voters in 2020.
Trump improved his performance in Greater Minnesota, but so did Biden
The Trump campaign’s steady focus on winning more rural areas of Minnesota paid dividends in many ways for Republicans, as Trump won 94,955 more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 outside of the Twin Cities metro area, according to Thursday morning results.
Still, Biden improved on Clinton’s vote count by more than 104,897. Biden also appears to have won four counties that Trump won in 2016: Clay, Blue Earth, Winona and Nicollet. A similar story played out in Wisconsin, where Trump increased his vote share of some rural counties while slipping in others.
Article continues after advertisement
Tim Lindberg, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota Morris, said it was a strong showing in more rural areas for the president. That’s especially true considering population growth outside of liberal-leaning city centers like Rochester and Mankato is stagnant, Lindberg said.
Trump really lost the state in the suburbs and in the Twin Cities, where turnout surged, Lindberg said. While Democrats improved on Clinton’s result in Greater Minnesota during 2018 midterms, the party failed this year to improve further or secure margins that Obama won outside the metro, Lindberg said. “All those questions about whether Trump’s appeal to rural Minnesotans was still as good, the answer seems to be yes,” he said.
Trump failed to make strides in northeast Minnesota
For all the political attention lavished on northeast Minnesota and the Iron Range — largely by Republicans — Trump didn’t make large improvements over his 2016 margins. Preliminary election results reported Thursday morning show a mixed bag for the president as Biden managed to pick up more total votes than Clinton across the region.
In St. Louis County, which includes Duluth and much of the Iron Range, Biden won more than 56 percent of the vote compared to Clinton’s 51 percent. Trump improved from roughly 39 to 41 percent. Biden ran up huge margins in Duluth, finishing at 68 percent to Clinton’s 59 percent in 2016. The former Vice President also made gains in the suburb of Hermantown.
Trump managed to win more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 in cities like Hibbing, Virginia, Eveleth and Ely. Yet Biden largely held his own. In Virginia, a city whose mayor Larry Cuffe joined Vice President Mike Pence at a Duluth rally during the campaign, voters chose Biden in 2020 after Clinton narrowly carried the city in 2016. The same was true in Eveleth, whose mayor also endorsed Trump. Hibbing did back Trump this year by a few hundred votes after favoring the president in 2016 by just seven votes.

Trump also gained votes across Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District, which covers northeast Minnesota but also stretches West to Grand Rapids, Park Rapids and far South to North Branch just outside the Twin Cities metro area. But the president’s 14.75 percent lead over Biden is a sliver smaller than his 2016 lead of 15.49 percent over Clinton in the district.
One silver lining for Trump was state Senate District 6, which covers a broad swath of St. Louis County outside of Duluth and includes much of the Iron Range cities large and small. The president led SD6 by roughly 1,100 more votes over his 2016 margin. DFL state Sen. David Tomassoni of Chisholm posted a comfortable win in the district, though Republican Robert Farnsworth holds a 47-vote lead on incumbent DFL state Rep. Julie Sandstede of Hibbing in House District 6A.
U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber’s large victory in the 8th CD was another bright spot in the region for Republicans.

Overall, Lindberg said northeast Minnesota was “about the same” as 2016, and is generally following trendlines across the state, where smaller cities and rural areas are trending Republican while larger cities shift toward Democrats. The Iron Range was always a relatively conservative place, even when voting for Democrats, Lindberg said. “Overall it really does appear that region is becoming the liberal bastion of Duluth and the far North Shore versus everybody else,” Lindberg said. “You almost have this microcosm of the same thing you see … with the Twin Cities versus Greater Minnesota.”
Minnesota Republicans have cemented their gains outside the Twin Cities metro
Lindberg said partisanship among Greater Minnesota voters was up this year as ticket-splitting seemed to decrease outside the Twin Cities metro. U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson finally lost a district that heavily favors Trump while the GOP picked up state legislative seats in Trump-friendly areas the DFL held in 2016. That includes Senate District 27, where Republican Gene Dornink has a 4 percent lead on five-term DFL Sen. Dan Sparks of Austin after losing to the incumbent by 10 points in 2016. The district went for Trump by 14 points in 2016.
While Republican Sens. Carla Nelson and David Senjem of Rochester hung on to their seats and ran ahead of the president, who is unpopular in Rochester, their margins were far closer than 2016. In that year, a higher percentage of voters split their tickets in Med City.
The GOP is also likely to pick up four state House seats in Greater Minnesota, meaning the party may have a net gain of four legislative seats outside of the Twin Cities metro area. The DFL might have picked up one seat in St. Cloud, where DFLer Aric Putnam took a narrow lead Wednesday evening over incumbent Republican Sen. Jerry Relph.
In addition to Farnsworth’s slim lead, Matt Bliss, a former state representative, ousted Rep. John Persell of Bemidji. Persell beat Bliss in 2018 by 11 votes. State Rep. Jeff Brand, DFL-St. Peter, is trailing Republican Susan Akland. Finally, Patricia Mueller, a Republican in the Austin area, holds a lead on DFL State Rep. Jeanne Poppe.
While the GOP has been winning seats in more rural areas for several cycles now, Democrats hoped a leftward pitch in Rochester and other urban centers would lead to victories. Instead, the GOP continued to add to its large majorities outstate. Lindberg said the number of swing legislative districts appears to be narrowing and exurban areas and cities like Rochester are the only competitive places. “Those rural areas are just gone” for the DFL, Lindberg said. “They’re all Republican now.”
Marijuana party candidates — some with GOP ties — may have swung control of the state Senate to Republicans
Partisan control of the state Senate was up for grabs in the 2020 election and Democrats hoped to oust Republican incumbents in Rochester, St. Cloud and the Twin Cities suburbs on their way to flip a 35-32 GOP majority.
Article continues after advertisement
But the DFL appears to have lost two close races in Rochester. Separately, Republicans may have won the crucial Austin area seat thanks in large part to third-party marijuana candidates. Sparks, the DFL Senator in SD27, was trailing GOP challenger Gene Dornink by a 1,567 margin Thursday; Legal Marijuana Now candidate Tyler Becvar collected 2,552 votes in the race.
Lindberg said most of those votes likely would have swung DFL if Becvar didn’t run, particularly since the party leadership supports legalizing marijuana while Republicans do not. Headed into the election, some of the pot party candidates said they were recruited by the GOP to run, or had ties to the party. The Minnesota Reformer reported Becvar posted a video in May supporting Dornink, though Becvar was later endorsed by the Legal Marijuana Now party.
If Democrats won both SD27 and held current margins across other races, they’d control the state Senate in 2021.""" ;

By Molly Miron Pioneer EditorÂ
Families of victims of the 2005 Red Lake shootings are a step closer to receiving settlement money.
The 21 families settled a lawsuit last month against the Red Lake School District for $1 million. The agreement was subject to court approval.
Beltrami County District Judge Paul Benshoof signed a settlement agreement on Wednesday afternoon in Beltrami County District Court. Philip Sieff of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi law firm of Minneapolis and Mark Rodgers of Rodgers Law Office in Bemidji represented the families during Wednesday's hearing. Shamus O'Meara of Johnson & Condon of Minneapolis and Mary K. Klein, Red Lake School District corporate attorney, represented the school.Â
The settlement will allot $900,000 to the 21 families and put $100,000 in an escrow fund until 2011 for potential other victims who haven't yet come forward. The estates of some victims, such as Neva Rogers and Derrick Brun, who were killed during the shooting rampage, will receive settlements from workers' compensation.
"The million dollars is the limit the school can pay on that tragedy," said Rodgers.
Sieff agreed, saying the settlement puts any issues with the school district and these victims to rest. However, he said other parties not part of this settlement could still come forward.
"The district is very pleased that a settlement was able to be reached in a very timely manner," said Klein.
"The settlement agreement is the result of near daily communication over the last year," said O'Meara. "The families are glad to this part of the tragedy behind them."
Rodgers said the injured parties feel the settlement is a positive step and will give them and their families some monetary compensation for the harm suffered as a result of the tragic shootings. He added that the investigation continues in relation to other responsible parties.
A federal court will decide how the $1 million will be divided, Rodgers said.
"We're hoping to resolve that fairly quickly," he said.
On March 21, 2005, 16-yearold Jeff Weise killed his grandfather and grandfather's girlfriend on the Red Lake Reservation. He then went to Red Lake High School and killed five students, a teacher and a security guard and injured seven others before killing himself.""" ;

<https://www.modbee.com/latest-news/article3120766.html> dct:description """There's nothing new about rap artists inviting controversy by glamorizing a thug lifestyle, with the most successful among them claiming ties to street gangs even as they move into mansions and get airplay on mainstream radio or music television.
A small niche within the rap scene, known as "horrorcore," is a little different. The genre is mainly associated with Detroit shock artists Insane Clown Posse, but it has spawned a host of imitators who excite crowds with musical horror stories in which murder, rape and suicide are recurrent themes.
Insane Clown Posse can't get its music on the radio, but claims to have 1 million devoted fans who call themselves "Juggalos" or "Juggalettes," and sometimes paint their faces to look like wicked clowns. Some round out the look by carrying small axes, like the cartoon hatchet man associated with the band.
Authorities point to assaults in Colorado, Utah, Washington and elsewhere when they argue that small sets of Juggalos have formed street gangs and deserve to be prosecuted just as the better-known Bloods and Crips, or Norteños and Sureños.

A March 7 assault in Graceada Park brought the debate to Modesto.
"I guess that makes me a high-ranking gang member, like a shot caller or something," joked Mario Delgado, who performs as Mars. He has played at festivals sponsored by Insane Clown Posse and recently moved from the East Bay to Modesto.
Mars was referring to an attack on a man who was at Graceada Park with his family. The assault was clownlike, yet brutal. It began with a teen running up to the man to demand a handshake and ended with a host of other Juggalos intervening to stop a fight.
The man had his leg broken in two places as his girlfriend and two daughters watched in horror.
Prosecutors say the Juggalos arrested at the park had all the ingredients of a criminal street gang: three or more members, a common sign or symbol (in this case the cartoon hatchet man), and banding together to commit a crime.
Brandon Ferrell, 18; Joshua Huggins, 17; Kurt Petersen, 22; and Larry Williams, 20, have pleaded not guilty and are in jail awaiting trial. News coverage of their case prompted a lot of feedback, including comments from people who say "true" Juggalos are opposed to violence.
What they are -- and aren't
A few Juggalos said they no longer would hang out in Graceada Park because fighting is wrong.
A former girlfriend of one defendant said fans are supposed to read between the lines to find meaning in songs that feature over-the-top violence.
A parent said he was irritated when his son got in trouble for wearing an Insane Clown Posse T-shirt to school because the boy never has been a troublemaker and was wrongly accused of being a gang member.
And a husband and father who likes the music said he sometimes paints his face for fun and spots people who are "down with the clown" all over town, identifying them by their tattoos or clothing or decals on their cars.
James Miller, 27, of Modesto thinks the park suspects misinterpreted the band's message, saying it is not a call to arms but an open invitation to misfits who need a place to blow off some steam and will not be turned away at Juggalo events.
He hopes Juggalo culture doesn't get a bad rap because of a few bad apples.
"I don't stand on corners 'claiming parks,' " Miller said. "I don't go around assaulting people."
During a hearing in the Graceada Park case, a crime analyst for the Modesto Police Department said local authorities have watched the Juggalos grow in numbers since their first contact with the group in 2005.
She said she has spent half of her time researching Juggalos in the past year, noting that her work includes surveying MySpace and other social networking Web sites to identify Insane Clown Posse fans who post photos of themselves throwing hand signs for WC, or "wicked clown."
A prosecutor said authorities have documented 38 Juggalos as gang members, including four who have been found guilty of assault, burglary and carjacking in Juvenile Court.
Profiled by T-shirts?
Harley Petero was surprised to learn that he is one of them.
Petero, a contractor and father of five, recalled a scene more than a year ago when his 17-year-old son and others were walking from their home in Modesto's airport neighborhood to a market to buy milk.
Members of the Central Valley Gang Impact Task Force swooped down upon the boy and his girlfriend, so Petero walked over to see what was going on.
The father, his son and the son's girlfriend were wearing Insane Clown Posse T-shirts.
The officers asked all sorts of questions and took pictures.
More than a year later, a defense investigator came calling, Petero said, because father, son and girlfriend are on the authorities' list of documented Juggalos.
Petero, who goes to horrorcore shows with his kids, said he never has been arrested and should not be criminalized for making a fashion statement. He said violent images in the music are so over the top that no sane person could take them seriously.
"They're like Deadheads -- Deadheads for the new millennium," said Petero, 43. "They just want to listen to this music."
Petero's wife, Tammy, worries because her husband and son could get slapped with a gang enhancement, and be subject to stiffer penalties if they are accused of a crime. She said one of her other sons, who was wearing a Lynard Skynard T-shirt, also walked over to check out the scene.
"They didn't say a word to him," said Tammy Petero, 36.
Define 'gang member'
Defense attorney Bill Miller represents Huggins, a minor who is charged as an adult in the Graceada Park case. He said gang laws give broad discretion to authorities. As Miller put it, "The Legislature didn't define what a gang member is, and the cops just make it up themselves."
Huggins and two of the other defendants face up to four years in prison if convicted of assault and three years more if a jury believes they are gang members.
Williams could rack up even more time because he was convicted of assault as a juvenile. The results of juvenile cases usually are confidential, but the prosecutor pointed to Williams' juvenile record in court to back up the notion that Juggalos engage in a pattern of criminal activity.
Mars, the horrorcore artist who recently moved from Pittsburg to Modesto along with his girlfriend and 2-year-old son, said Juggalos are targeted across the nation, often by people who take the song lyrics literally.
He said he has played at a Woodstock-like festival Insane Clown Posse holds in Illinois each summer, claims to have been questioned by officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and was eager to talk about being blamed for a school shooting in northern Minnesota.
On March 21, 2005, 16-year-old Jeffrey Weise killed two people at his grandfather's home on an American Indian reservation, then went to Red Lake High School, where he fatally shot five students and one teacher, then took his own life.
Weise left online journal entries showing that he was a big fan of Mars and another horrorcore rapper, Jimmy Donn, according to published reports. Mars, who performs in a mask like the one Hannibal Lector wore in the movie "Silence of the Lambs," blames the troubled teen's parents for the tragedy.
Mars thinks authorities go too far when they prosecute Juggalos as gang members because every group has a few people who commit crimes. He said Juggalos are just kids who have a weird sense of humor and wish it were Halloween every day.
The 29-year-old rapper said controversy makes his sales spike. So he hopes the debate rages on.
Mars' latest album is called "School House Glock!"

The UK event officially became the Apple Music Festival in 2015 as part of a rebranding away from its original name of the iTunes Festival.
The annual show was first held in 2007 – typically running for a month at a time with concerts every night, and tickets going to competition winners.
Artists who played the event over its decade-long run included Adele, Oasis, Mumford & Sons, Paul Simon, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Arctic Monkeys, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams (pictured), The Weeknd, One Direction and Beck.
Over the last two years, the Apple Music Festival has become 10 night-long event at the Roundhouse in Camden, London during September.
The 2016 line-up included Elton John, The 1975, Chance The Rapper and Alicia Keys.
However, the cancellation of the festival doesn’t signal a move away from live events by Apple Music completely.
The brand was recently a partner of shows by Haim and Skepta in London and Arcade Fire in Brooklyn and it had a heavy presence at SXSW in Texas earlier this year – where it backed shows from Lana Del Rey, Vince Staples and DJ Khaled.
In addition, Apple Music also sponsored Drake’s 32-date Summer Sixteen Tour in 2016 and it supports regular live sessions from its ‘Up Next’ artists.
The closure of the Apple Music Festival is likely because Apple is concentrating its resources on one-off events like these, in addition to its original content efforts in video – which have recently included a Carpool Karaoke spin-off series and a behind-the-scenes documentary on Harry Styles.
The iTunes Festival started off life at London’s ICA then spent two years at Koko before moving to The Roundhouse in 2009.

Bernie Sanders has maintained his advantage among Democratic presidential contenders in the New Hampshire primary just over a week from the vote, according to a new NBC10 Boston/Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll.
The poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters, released Sunday, has Sanders in first place at 31%, followed by Joe Biden at 24%, Elizabeth Warren at 17% and Pete Buttigieg at 8%.
All three of the frontrunners narrowly picked up support over the last poll, released last week, while Buttigieg's support appears to be dipping somewhat.
The prior NBC10 Boston/Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll had the candidates in the same order: Sanders (29%) leading Joe Biden (22%), Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Pete Buttigieg (10%).
The New Hampshire primary will be held on Feb. 11.
The poll comes just days before the Iowa caucuses, where many polls show Sanders in the lead as well. The first two presidential contests, Iowa and New Hampshire have long been seen as key prizes in the primaries.
Among likely Republican primary voters in the poll released Sunday, 72% said they would vote for President Donald Trump if the primary were held today, the same as in the previous poll. But the president's approval rating rose significantly from 77% last week to 90%, trumping his October (81%) and September (83%) approval ratings.
The telephone survey was conducted between Jan. 29-Feb. 1 by RKM Research and Communications in collaboration with NBC10 Boston, NECN, Telemundo Boston, Franklin Pierce University and the Boston Herald.

The Ultra Music Festival drew an impressive 55,000 people per day this year during its three-day weekend at Bayfront Park in Miami, but more impressive was the number of Latinos who took part this year during several of the musical sets by world renowned DJs like David Guetta, Steve Aoki and DJ Snake.
On Friday night, as DJ Steve Aoki finished playing his remix of J Balvin’s global anthem “Mi Gente” that got the crowd jumping he switched the pace down a bit when he mixed in a Reggaeton music favorite as he introduced its vocalist, Mr. Daddy Yankee onto the Ultra main stage.
Aoki’s EDM fans quickly recognizing the catchy tune began to applaud and sing along with the man responsible for putting Reggaeton music on the map in the late 90s with his hit song “La Gasolina”.
Yankee belted out a portion of the song that made him a house hold name followed by one of his latest singles “Dura” ending his first-ever presentation in front of EDM fans with his current collaboration with Aoki, Play N Skillz and Merengue music singer Elvis Crespo “Azuquita”.
Crespo excited about his first presentation as well, said he is extremely grateful for the opportunity to crossover musical genres.
“Impressive I feel blessed!” said Crespo. “I feel grateful that I’m able to make this crossover in genre and generations really, I feel blessed for the opportunity to reach new audiences.”

This was J Balvins first ever performance at Ultra and when NBC6.com asked him how he felt about his performance this is what he answered.

<https://www.nbcnews.com/id/22539077> dct:description """Six snowmobilers missing in the mountains for 2½ days while a howling blizzard swirled around them were rescued Monday — hungry and cold but unhurt — after taking shelter in a cozy cabin and calling 911 on a cell phone when the storm eased up.
The group, consisting of two couples and two teenagers, broke into the cabin, where they huddled around a gas grill and dined on popcorn and chicken bouillon they found inside.
“We counted 18 blankets. We were cozy,” 31-year-old Shannon Groen said after rescue crews on snowmobiles brought the group to safety. “God was looking out for us. When we knew we were safe we began to worry about the rescuers and we prayed for them.”
Groen and the others were trapped by one in a series of storms that killed at least three people across the West, unloaded as much as 11 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada range, flooded hundreds of homes in Nevada and knocked out power to a quarter-million Californians. At least three people — two skiers and a hiker — were missing in the snow-covered mountains of California and Colorado.
Groen and her husband, Jason, had gone snowmobiling with their daughter Aspen to celebrate her 14th birthday. Also along were one of Jason Groen’s employees, Mike Martin; Martin’s wife, Missy; and their son, Jessie, 13. All are from Farmington, N.M.
Lost and out of gas
The group had set out on what was supposed to be a daylong adventure but got lost and ran out of gas on Friday night near 10,222-foot Cumbres Pass, just north of the New Mexico line.
They sought shelter in a cabin near the isolated and snowbound Osier Station, a small wooden building that serves as a summertime stop on a railroad line for sightseers.
Jason Groen, the 36-year-old owner of a car wash, said his cell phone didn’t work in the cabin, and bad weather kept him from leaving to find a place where he could get a signal until Monday morning. Meanwhile, rescuers were hampered by the threat of avalanches, high winds and snow that at some points was coming down 8 inches an hour.
When the storm finally broke, Groen hiked up to a point with cell phone reception and alerted rescuers to their location.
Aspen said she had a fine birthday: “It was fun, but wasn’t something I would want to do again.”
“I never had a prayer that they would all get off the mountain alive,” said Groen’s mother, Beverly Downey. “By the grace of God and our friends the media, I hope and pray that no one else ever has to go through this again.”
In the same Four Corners region, where Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico meet, a chartered bus taking skiers home to Arizona ran off a narrow, sharply curved road Sunday night near Mexican Hat, Utah, killing nine people and injuring about 20 others.
About 40 miles northwest of Conejos, searchers took advantage of a break in the weather to resume looking for two skiers missing since Saturday near Colorado’s Wolf Creek Pass. The search was slowed by the threat of avalanches.
Elsewhere in Colorado, two stretches of Interstate 70 — the main route to many of the state’s major ski resorts — were closed by avalanches.""" ;

The service member got off several rounds but was unable to stop the gunman, who fired at the building, then charged inside and kept shooting, said Ed Reinhold, special agent in charge of the bureau’s Knoxville office.
In a chilling timeline, Reinhold described how the gunman, identified as Muhammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, moved through the building and shot people as he encountered them, then ran out the back and kept firing.
Four Marines and a Navy petty officer were killed before Chattanooga police shot and killed Abdulazeez. Four of the service members died outside, in a motor pool area behind the building, and one died inside, Reinhold said.
It all took less than five minutes.
Reinhold said the FBI was treating the gunman as a “homegrown violent extremist,” and he said investigators believe he had no help in executing the attack. But he said it was too early to determine whether Abdulazeez was radicalized.
Mohammad Youssuf Adbulazeez Hamilton County Sheriffs Office via AP
Investigators have focused on a trip to Jordan last year by Abdulazeez, and an uncle has been detained there, according to his lawyer.
NBC News reported on Tuesday that Abdulazeez downloaded audio recordings of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and al Qaeda recruiter killed by an American drone strike in 2011.
A family representative has told NBC News that Abdulazeez had been in a three-day downward spiral before the attack, suffered from depression and had thoughts of suicide.
The Navy and Marines center was the second target of Abdulazeez’s rampage. Minutes earlier, he had unloaded dozens of rounds into the doors of a military recruiting station about seven miles away.
In the chaos at the Navy and Marines center, two service members “attempted to provide cover” and help people escape, Reinhold said.
And a Marine commander, Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier, said that Marines went room to room to shepherd their fellow service members to safety, and that some “willingly ran back into the fight.”
"When history records what happened in Chattanooga last week," he said, "it won’t be remembered for the heinous actions of one individual. The legacy of that day is one of valor — a day of American strength.”
Reinhold said that the service member fired on Abdulazeez after he crashed the gates of the Navy and Marines center and got out of his car carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and ammunition.
Investigators will have to wait for autopsy results to determine whether the service member hit Abdulazeez, Reinhold said.
Authorities said that two weapons belonging to service members were found at the scene, but they offered no details on the nature of those weapons. At least one of those two weapons was fired at the gunman.
The military plans to increase security at recruiting stations and reserve centers because of the attack, but those plans do not include arming personnel at off-base facilities like the ones attacked in Chattanooga.
Besides the two weapons belonging to service members, investigators at the scene found two guns belonging to Abdulazeez and one in his car, Reinhold said. All five service members were killed with bullets from the same gun, he said.""" ;

Less than 24 hours after his brother allegedly shot and killed four people in a terrifying citywide rampage across Darwin, Clinton Hoffmann has spoken.
Mr Hoffman, a well-known local businessman in the Darwin area, offered his condolences to the victims of last night’s shooting allegedly carried out by his brother Ben Hoffmann.
“There is public speculation that the offender was my brother Ben Hoffmann,” Mr Hoffmann said in a statement.
“It is important at this time to allow the proper and thorough investigation of these matters by the Northern Territory police and I do not wish to do or say anything that might interfere with or compromise that investigation.
“Having said that, I wish to express my, and my family’s deepest condolences to all of those affected by those events including the families and friends of those who tragically lost their lives, the injured woman and those who came into harm’s way.
“We are as shocked and distressed about these events as the community around us.
“In the fullness of time, it may be appropriate to say more. At present, I thank my friends and colleagues for their understanding and their expression of support, especially to me, my mother and other members of my family.
“In the interests of allowing legal matters to properly run their course, I will not be making a further public statement on these matters at this time.”
Earlier, police revealed the alleged Darwin mass shooter was seeking out one particular person when he embarked on an hour-long shooting rampage that claimed four lives.
Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw indicated at a media briefing today that the alleged mass shooter, identified as local man Ben Hoffman, 45, may have been on the hunt for one particular individual.
Police said multiple witnesses said he was looking for certain people or a person.
“It’s based on some witnesses who have indicated he was looking for certain people. One in particular we know was interstate and used to reside at a particular address and that’s why we’ve undertaken that line of inquiry,” police said.
“Initial indications believe it may be that he was looking for certain individuals.”
Witnesses have said the gunman went “room-to-room” inside the hotel, and was screaming out for “Alex”.
Police confirmed the man the shooter was looking for was named Alex, and was interstate.
“We’ve located that individual and we’ve spoken to him.”
Police also indicated that there are victims who were “innocent”, indicating they were not known to the alleged shooter, who has previously been incarcerated.
One of the victims has already been identified as Hassan Baydoun, a 32-year-old taxi driver who was tragically killed on his meal break.
RELATED: Tributes for taxi driver Hassan Baydoun killed in Darwin shooting
Mr Baydoun was from Lebanon but had been living in Darwin for 10 years when he was killed yesterday at the Palms Motel.
Police are still establishing the number of victims known to the alleged gunman as they liaise with families.
“We know he was looking for one individual,” Commissioner Kewshaw said today.
The Commissioner said they were looking at whether the killings were motivated by jail grudges, and drug related vendettas.
Mr Hoffman, a heavily tattooed roofer, was admitted to hospital on Monday, the day before he allegedly committed the mass shooting. Police were not able to confirm why he was admitted.
The accused, who police are yet to interview but plan to charge with four counts of murder, comes from a respected Darwin family.
How the 45-year-old’s life spun so far off the rails is not yet clear, but speaking at a press conference last night, NT Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it wasn’t Hoffman’s first brush with the law.
He told reporters the alleged gunman had been out on parole after being freed from jail earlier this year, and police were now looking at possible links to outlaw motorcycle gangs.
Today, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the accused had been released from a recent 14-day custodial sentence at some point in the last month. He was on parole, and was wearing an electronic bracelet at the time of the attack, according to police.
But police said they were unable to use the device to track him during the hour it took to find and arrest the alleged shooter because it was not “a tactical device”.
He had previously breached parole for breaking curfew, for which he was given a 14-day custodial sentence, the commissioner said.
The Northern Territory government has ordered a review of the 103 people currently on parole following a mass shooting in Darwin.
“We’ve asked for a detailed report from the Parole Board of the alleged offender and directed an immediate review of the 103 people currently on parole,” Chief Minister Michael Gunner said today.
“We’ve directed an immediate review of everyone on electronic monitoring.” There are 196 people being actively monitored in the NT.
Of the 103 on parole, 46 were also being electronically monitored. “This work will be thorough. It will be completed by the end of next week. While we have no reason to believe an event like this will occur again, it is critical we make every effort that it does not,” Mr Gunner said.
Police confirmed Hoffman had his share of brushes with the law, but when he was released on parole in January after spending more than a year behind bars, things began to look up.
His well-known family had been able to get him a steady job. But, it didn’t last.
It is understood, in recent days, Hoffman had been let go from his job with a local roofing company after continually failing to show up for work.
The NT News reports Hoffman’s mum had lined the job up for him through a family friend earlier this year — to give her son a “second chance in life” — not long after he was released on parole.
However, his former boss spoke to the newspaper, explaining why he had to let him go.
“He wasn’t coming in to work,” he said. “I basically said a few days ago — I told him, ‘You have to go elsewhere, you have to start looking for other work and start over’.”
Stunned local resident Leah Potter said almost everybody in Darwin knew Hoffman and his family.
“He’s a local Darwinite that all of us know,” she told the Today show this morning.
However, she added his run-ins with the law were also common knowledge.
“It’s not a secret. You can find out any of this information just on the sentencing report online,” she said.
“He was in jail for a violent crime — same sort of thing. He walked through a suburb attacking people violently and he was jailed for that. He was released in January. All this is public knowledge.
“This was a man with a lot of problems. We all knew he had his own specific problems. And he had a history of it.”
The Northern Territory government has ordered a review of the 103 people currently on parole following a mass shooting.
“We’ve asked for a detailed report from the Parole Board of the alleged offender and directed an immediate review of the 103 people currently on parole,” Chief Minister Michael Gunner said on Wednesday.
“We’ve directed an immediate review of everyone on electronic monitoring.”
Four men were killed and a woman was rushed to hospital with gunshot wounds to her legs after last night’s shooting rampage.
Parts of the city were thrown into lockdown just after 5.45pm, as police scoured the city to find Hoffman who was allegedly armed with a sawn-off shotgun.
Mr Kershaw said Hoffman was well-known to police and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet as he evaded officers through Darwin.
After being on the run for more than an hour, Hoffman called the NT Police Duty Superintendent and asked to be placed in protective custody, Mr Kershaw confirmed.
“We do believe he was trying to hand himself in,” Mr Kershaw said.
Hoffman was eventually tackled at a city roundabout by heavily armed tactical response group police dressed in camouflage gear.
Video taken at the scene shows him covered in blood, no longer wearing a shirt and lying on his back as he tries to kick the rifle of one of the police officers.
He was tasered at the scene before being taken away in a police vehicle.
Police are now planning to charge Hoffman with four counts of murder.""" ;

Darwin Shooting: Ben Hoffman has been charged with four counts of murder
Alleged Darwin shooter Ben Hoffman has told a court he needs help and he’s “very sorry for what’s happened”.
The 45-year-old faced Darwin Local Court for the first time this morning — where his parole was revoked.
As an “At Risk” order was made by Deputy Chief Judge Elizabeth Morris, Hoffman told the court “I do need help, I’ve asked for help” and “I’m very sorry about what’s happened.”
Hoffmann appeared via video link from prison and also said he wanted to speak to his lawyer Peter Maley as soon as possible before being remanded to appear in court again in September.
The appearance comes as chilling CCTV images have caught the moment he allegedly killed his last victim.
The grainy images allegedly show Hoffman shirtless and covered in blood as he walked from the home of casino worker Rob Courtney, 52, who police say he murdered.
The shocking alleged murder came after police say Hoffman killed three other men with a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun on Tuesday while he was high on ice.
After taxi driver Hassan Baydoun, 33, Nigel Hellings, 75, and Michael Sisois, 57, were shot dead, CCTV footage allegedly shows the 45-year-old Hoffman arriving at Mr Courtney’s home in Woolner and walking inside, armed with a shotgun.
Mr Courtney tried to defend himself and stabbed the gunman before he was allegedly shot dead in front of his housemate.
CCTV images then allegedly show Hoffman walking out, shirtless.
Mr Courtney was facing a charge of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and was due in court yesterday.

Yesterday, NT Police charged Hoffman with four counts of murder, two of recklessly endangering serious harm and one of criminal damage, with more charges expected over Tuesday night’s deadly shootings.
He is believed to have known two of the four men he is accused of shooting and killing in the bloody rampage.
Hoffman has had surgery for knife wounds since being tasered and arrested by police on Tuesday night. The surgery delayed detectives interviewing and charging him until Thursday.
The four killings occurred in about 30 minutes, with the gunman appearing to target specific locations.
Police believe he was affected by the drug ice, which he has a history of using.
Police have not ruled out an accomplice being involved because the ammunition used with the shotgun was purchased by a “well-known associate” of Hoffmann’s, Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said.
When asked about the gunman’s motives, he said there were potentially disputes relating to drug debts and a woman.
“There is a bit of both there. There is drugs, I think, I am speculating here, but we are following those two lines,” Mr Kershaw said.
Police also revealed they had they pulled Hoffmann over for speeding just hours before the shooting.
Mr Kershaw said police had pulled the suspect over about 10.52am the day of the shooting at Arnhem Highway, Humpty Doo, for doing 94km/h in an 80km/h zone.
“He was not displaying any adverse behaviour,” he said. “There nothing out of the ordinary (when he) was observed by police officers.”
Mr Kershaw said he was “very satisfied with our approach” in letting the alleged gunman go.
He said it was a “possibility” the accused was seen with a firearm at the time, but that was still under investigation.
“You have got to treat everyone fairly, and police officers have reasonable suspicions,” he said. “They didn’t have any at that point in time.”
The alleged gunman was given an infringement notice for speeding.
The violence started at 5.39pm that day at the Palms Motel where Hoffmann allegedly shot and killed taxi driver Hassan Baydoun, 33, who was on a meal break.
Mr Baydoun’s cousin Abdallah Salman said his relative did not know the shooter and was accidentally caught up in the shootings as the alleged gunman went from room to room firing his gun and shouting for a person named Alex.
A 23-year-old woman at the Palms who police do not believe knew Hoffmann was shot in the legs and remains in hospital.
The shooter went on to kill Nigel Hellings, 75, in Gardens Hill Crescent less than a kilometre away at what might have been the former home of an associate.
He then killed Michael Sisois, 57, who knew Hoffmann after previously working together, a few hundred metres away in the carpark of the Buff Club.
He then drove two kilometres to Woolner where he tried to enter police headquarters, kicking the door before phoning Duty Superintendent Lee Morgan who negotiated with him and alerted police to his location.
The person named Alex, who Hoffmann was looking for in the days leading up to the killings, was interstate and was charged a fortnight ago in Darwin with various traffic and drug offences.
Vincent Sisois, the brother of Mr Sisois, angrily asked why Hoffmann had been released from prison on parole recently given he was known to be dangerous and violent.
“Why was he let out, they knew something would happen and they let him out. Why?” Mr Sisois said.
The NT Government has asked for a report from the Parole Board on Hoffmann and to review all people on parole, however Attorney-General Natasha Fyles defended the system on Thursday.
Hoffmann is from a respected local family involved in business.""" ;

Galveston marks anniversary of disaster Victims of surprise hurricane remembered GALVESTON (AP) - The surprise surprise hurricane that attacked Galveston on Sept. 8, 1900, reached its terrific crescendo shortly after nightfall. About that time, 100 hundred years later, Galvestonians were set to gather Friday for a candlelight memorial in honor of the 6,000 to 10,000 who perished in the nation's deadliest natural disaster. As a steady drizzle fell throughout throughout the day, evening ceremonies planned for the city's high school football stadium were being moved into the school's auditorium. Scaled-down Scaled-down Scaled-down events were planned since an overflow crowd was expected at the Ball High School auditorium, which only seats 1,200 people. Thunder from a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico rolled ominously Friday morning when the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word marked the site of St. Mary's Orphanage. There, 90 children and 10 nuns died when the storm surge splintered two beachfront dormitories.

A century ago, hurricane left thousands dead Galveston to honor victims of nation's deadliest natural disaster. By MARK BABINECK The Associated Press GALVESTON, Texas The hurricane hurricane struck by surprise, decimating decimating this island city, killing thousands thousands and sweeping entire neighborhoods neighborhoods clean. Linda MacDonald's late grandfather grandfather lived through the Great Storm a century ago this week and told her unforgettable stories. Just 6 when the winds and water crashed through, he rode out the tempest in his father's bakery. "He could hear children calling for their mothers, women screaming for help and men begging for mercy from God," said MacDonald, a Galveston native and an amateur expert on the storm. "He said he could hear sounds that were very faint, then they grew louder and louder, then the sound abruptly cut off, and he knew someone's someone's life had ended." No one knows the storm's toll for sure. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people died on the island and nearby mainland. The lower figure is more than double double the combined loss of life in the Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania, the Great Chicago Fire and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, making the Great Storm of Sept. 8, 1900, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. history. The city will honor the victims with ceremonies this weekend. Plaques mark the buildings that survived; survived; a harborside slide show and exhibits will examine the aftermath of the hurricane rated by researchers today as a Category 4 on the 5-point 5-point 5-point Saffir-Simpson Saffir-Simpson Saffir-Simpson Scale. "My grandfather said it's important important for people to know about the 1900 storm, because every night before you go to bed you tell your family you love them," MacDonald said. "Then the next morning, if you're lucky enough to still have your house and family around you, you get down on your knees and thank God." In 1900, Galveston was a commercial commercial giant, home to Texas' first post office, telephones and medical college. Its streets led to imposing Greek Revival, Romanesque and Italianate mansions. Downtown was packed with ornate office buildings, many on The Strand, known then as the "Wall Street of the Southwest." A booming cotton export trade had made this city of 38,000 among the wealthiest per capita in the United United States. Shippers knew Galveston was vulnerable vulnerable to the whims of nature, but they had little choice: The city boasted boasted the only deep-water deep-water deep-water port in Texas. "Remember, in 1900 there is no Houston Ship Channel," said historian historian Patricia Bixel, a co-author co-author co-author of "Galveston and the 1900 Storm," released this summer. At least 10 times in the 19th century, century, hurricanes struck the barrier island, which was inhabited first by Karankawa Indians, then pirate Jean Lafitte's band before American settlers arrived in 1838. An 1875 "overflow," the understated understated term islanders used for tidal flooding, first prompted calls for a beachfront wall. Talk of a breakwater breakwater resumed briefly after an 1886 hur- hur- ricane erased Indianola to the southwest southwest But concern quickly faded each time, and no action was taken. In early September 1900, U.S. Weather Bureau climatologist Isaac Cline knew a storm in the Gulf of Mexico had raked Cuba. Noting Galveston's falling barometric barometric pressure, he suspected it would land near the 30-mile-long 30-mile-long 30-mile-long 30-mile-long 30-mile-long island. On Sept 7, Cline hoisted a red and black flag signaling a tropical storm was looming, but he paired it with a white one indicating it probably would land east of town, sparing the city its brunt Joseph Cline, Isaac's brother and a fellow weatherman, awoke before dawn Sept. 8 to find their yard flooded. flooded. Water kept rising despite strengthening north winds that should have repelled the storm. TSuch high water with opposing winds never observed previously," Isaac Cline wrote in a telegram to Washington. The brothers continued to send dispatches until the last communications communications line snapped at mid-afternoon. mid-afternoon. mid-afternoon. mid-afternoon. Isaac Cline's frantic warnings and the threatening skies sent many to higher ground, although the city's highest point was only 9 feet. Others ignored the calls, playing in the surf or taking refuge in frame homes raised slightly above ground level. In his recent book, "Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time and the Deadliest Hurricane in History," author Erik Larson took Cline and the Weather Bureau to task for failing to be better prepared for the dangerous storm spinning offshore. However, most longtime residents had weathered storms and likely would not have fled to the mainland. In any case, residents were hemmed in by 2 p.m. as flooding prevented prevented trains or carriages from even reaching the four bridges over the bay. Tides raged inward from both the gulf and the bay. Homes disintegrated disintegrated and rushing waters swept people away. Strengthening winds began to tear slate shingles and launch them and other debris with fatal results. The island was submerged by 3 p.m. Chaos intensified as people scrambled scrambled for cover, besieged by a 15V4-foot 15V4-foot 15V4-foot storm surge. Currents obliterated the Sisters of Charity seaside orphanage, killing all 10 nuns and 90 of the 93 children. Three boys escaped a collapsing dormitory dormitory and clung to an uprooted tree. "The sisters and children went to the second story as the waters of the gulf filled the first floor," MacDonald MacDonald said. "The sisters then tied the young orphans to their own bodies with the rope in a valiant, yet sacrificial effort to protect them." One of the nuns was later found still lashed to several children. Daring rescues continued into the darkness. Joseph Corthell and his brothers pulled more than 200 into their skiff; a nun at the Ursuline Convent tied a rope around her waist, swam into the surf and signaled her sisters to pull her in each time she grabbed a victim. The worst of the storm was over by 10 p.m. But the horror had only begun. A mild Sunday morning revealed unspeakable destruction.

At least one in six citizens was dead, mortally injured or hopelessly trapped. Tides had piled wreckage two stories high. "The wall of debris mowed down anything in its path," MacDonald said. "But when it stopped it acted as a dike, protecting the houses in front of it." American Red Cross founder Clara Barton, who was 78, made organizing relief in Galveston her last mission of mercy. When she saw that black residents residents were being denied the same access to aid as whites, she quickly set up a segregated system to ensure all were assisted. The initial death toll was estimated estimated at 1,000. It quickly multiplied as bodies were pulled from trees, wrested wrested from wreckage and fished out of Galveston Bay. There were too many to bury properly, so officials tried weighing down hundreds of corpses and depositing them in the gulf. They floated back. Disposing of the dead, treating the injured, sheltering the homeless, clearing debris and replacing roughly roughly 2,600 wrecked houses was a big enough job, but officials knew they had to do more. The first task was to build the long-proposed long-proposed long-proposed seawall. Three miles long, 16 feet thick at its base and 17 feet above mean low tide, the first phase took two years to build for a then-mindboggling then-mindboggling then-mindboggling $1.6 million.

It can get that hot here in New Jersey, and that's exactly what happened in the summer of 1936, when the Garden State had its highest temperature reading ever recorded. On July 10 that year, the thermometer at a climate station in the Runyon section of Old Bridge soared to 110 degrees, a record that still stands today, said New Jersey State Climatologist David Robinson at Rutgers University.
The closest scorcher since then was a 108-degree temperature reading at Newark International Airport on July 22, 2011, when New Jersey was suffering through a brutal summer heat wave.
And, in case you're wondering, that was the actual air temperature -- not the "real-feel" heat index. Same with the 110-degree reading in Runyon, Robinson said.
Through the past 121 years, when reliable data started being documented, New Jersey has had its fair share of extreme weather, from torrential rain storms to nasty blizzards.
The most recent record set was Wednesday: the hottest ocean temperature ever recorded, 83.3 degrees, off the coast of Atlantic City, as the first heat wave of August was getting under way.
Some of the state's most notable meteorological records can be found in the photo gallery above.
The heat wave is expected to continue this weekend, with temperatures climbing into the mid-90s. Forecasters say the heat index -- how hot it feels when you combine the air temperature with the humidity -- could get as high as 105 to 110 degrees.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Library of Congress Library of Congress
Thursday is the last day of the official 2017 hurricane season. It's been the most destructive year in recorded history, according to the National Hurricane Center, causing what may turn out to be more than $200 billion in damages. It's also the first time that three Category 4 hurricanes have hit the United States in the same year.
For all the ruination in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, at least Americans could see the hurricanes coming. TV networks covered the storm tracks exhaustively. But what happens to an American city when a hurricane strikes without warning?
The grandest city in Texas
The Great Galveston Storm came ashore the night of Sept 8, 1900, with an estimated strength of a Category 4. It remains the deadliest natural disaster and the worst hurricane in U.S. history.
From 6,000 to 12,000 people died on Galveston Island and the mainland. Texas' most advanced city was nearly destroyed.

Forecasting was primitive in those days — they relied on spotty reports from ships in the Gulf of Mexico. Citizens of Galveston could see that a storm was brewing offshore, but had no idea that it was a monster.
"Everyone went about their usual tasks until about 11 a.m. when my brother, Jacob, and our cousin, Allen Brooks, came from the beach with the report that the Gulf was very rough and the tide very high," remembered Katherine Vedder Pauls, not quite 6 years old at the time. Her oral history and others used for this report are archived at Galveston's Rosenberg Library.

"About half past 3," she continued, "Jacob and Allen came running, shouting excitedly that the Gulf looked like a great gray wall about 50-feet high and moving slowly toward the island."
At the dawn of the 20th century, Galveston was the grandest city in Texas. It could boast the biggest port, the most millionaires, the swankiest mansions, the first telephones and electric lights, and the most exotic bordellos. After the 1900 storm, she would never regain her status.
"No tongue can tell it!"
What became of the people of Galveston is the story of what happened before accurate weather forecasting, mandatory evacuations, and storm building codes.
"We knew there was a storm coming, but we had no idea that it was as bad as it was," said William Mason Bristol, who was 21 when he rode out the storm in his mother's boardinghouse. "You see, we didn't have a weather bureau that give us the dope that they got now...They had no airplanes to go up there and see how bad it was."

The hurricanes of 2017 were destructive in terms of dollars, but the official death toll remains well under 300. In 1900, thousands died.
The unnamed hurricane swept in from the Gulf with an estimated tidal surge of 15 feet, so high that it swallowed the skinny barrier island that was only 5 feet above sea level.
"Oh, it was a awful thing. You want me tell you, but no tongue can tell it!" recalled Annie McCullough. She was about 22 years old in 1900. Her family was on a mule-drawn wagon trying to escape the rising tide.

"The water was comin' so fast. The wagon gettin' so it was floatin'. The poor mules swimmin' that was pullin'. And the men laid flat on their stomach, holdin' the little children."
Survivors wrote of wind that sounded "like a thousand little devils shrieking and whistling," of 6-foot waves coming down Broadway Avenue, of a grand piano riding the crest of one, of slate shingles turned into whirling saw blades, and of streetcar tracks becoming waterborne battering rams that tore apart houses.
"The animals tried to swim to safety and the frightened squawking chickens were roosting everywhere they could get above the water," Pauls remembered. "People from homes already demolished were beginning to drift into our house, which still stood starkly against the increasing fury of the wind and water."

At the height of the storm, John W. Harris remembered two dozen terrified people climbing in through the windows of their home on Tremont Street. His mother prepared for rising floodwaters by lashing her children together.
"Mother had a trunk strap around each one of us to hold onto us as long as she could," he recalled.
Rosenberg School, built of brick, became a refuge for Annie McCullough's family and many others.

"The people was screamin' and hollerin' and so, huntin' their folks," she said in an oral history recorded by her grand-niece, Izola Collins. "The wind! Those men that was in the school, all they could do was stand against those doors and hold 'em."
The single most heart-wrenching tragedy happened to St. Mary's orphanage. Ten Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word and 90 children died when fearsome waves destroyed two wooden dormitories, that were built close to the beach in the belief that ocean breezes would reduce the danger of yellow fever. The sisters tethered the orphans together with clothesline. That's how they were found the next day, drowned. Only three boys escaped.
"A terrible time"
The storm began to subside about daybreak. The sun rose on Sept. 9 on a coastal city obliterated. One survivor described "knots of people frightened out of their wits, crazy men and women crying and weeping at the tops of their voices."
Corpses were everywhere. Authorities declared martial law and began to force men — most of whom were black — at bayonet point to collect the dead, pile them on barges, and dump them in the Gulf for burial. But the cadavers washed back onshore. Finally, they had to be burned in funeral pyres. There were orders to shoot on sight the "ghouls" who stole jewelry from the tangled bodies.
"It was a terrible time, it really was," recalled Louise Bristol Hopkins, who was seven. "I heard the stories of women with long hair who had been caught in the trees with their hair and cut to pieces with slates that had been flying."

Katherine Vedder Pauls recollected a ghoulish incident that happened to her mother.
"She stepped on a barrel concealed by the water. It rolled and she went under with it. She grabbed at something to pull herself up. It was the body of a small girl. Her self-control gave way and she wept hysterically."
Harris, who became a prominent banker and philanthropist on the island, lost 11 relatives in the 1900 storm. He remembered the next morning his family was having breakfast in their house, that withstood the waves, when the mayor came by.
"He said to father, 'John, your whole family are destroyed.' And I remember it's the first time that I ever saw father with tears in his eyes. He had no idea of the extent of the damage. We hadn't left the house yet."

In the years after the horrific storm, Galveston reinvented itself in a burst of municipal determination. The US Army Corps of Engineers constructed a 17-foot seawall. The city undertook an ambitious "grade-raising." Two thousand surviving structures — from shanties to a massive Catholic church — were jacked up and sand pumped underneath. Both the seawall and the grade-raising were regarded as engineering marvels of their day.
For decades, people on Galveston Island never spoke of the 1900 storm. "The folks that survived the storm were sort of like people who survived a war," recalled former state Sen. Babe Schwartz, a legendary Galveston figure. He was interviewed in 2000.
"No chamber of commerce wants to talk about the worst tragedy in the history of the United States where 6,000 to 8,000 people died on this little ol' island."
This story was drawn from a documentary that originally aired on NPR on Sept 8, 2000, on the centennial of the 1900 storm. It was produced by John Burnett in collaboration with the Kitchen Sisters, Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, for their Lost & Found Sound series.""" ;

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Zalubowski/AP David Zalubowski/AP
Updated May 8 at 1:15 a.m. ET
Officials say one student is dead and eight students were injured in a shooting at a public charter school in Highlands Ranch, Colo., a suburb south of Denver.
In a tweet, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said the deceased was an 18-year-old student at the STEM School.
"It is with extreme sadness that we can confirm that 1 student at the STEM School was killed in today's #stemshooting incident. The immediate family has been notified. Douglas County Coroner Jill Romann (who) has not officially identified the student is stating it's an 18 year old male," the tweet said.
No information was available about the other victims.
Two suspects are currently in custody. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said one suspect is an adult male and the other is a juvenile male. Both are students at the STEM School, and were not previously known to local law enforcement.
The adult suspect was identified as Devon Erickson, 18. The sheriff's office did not release photos of the suspect, saying that it could jeopardize the ongoing investigation.

"This is a terrible event. This is something that no one wants to have happen in their community," Spurlock said in a press conference late Tuesday afternoon. "Two individuals walked into the STEM school, got deep inside the school and engaged students in two separate locations."
"We do have eight students in area hospitals right now. Several of them are in critical condition," he added.
All of the victims are 15 years and older.
The STEM School has 1,800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
Authorities said over Twitter that they responded to a "call of shots fired" at STEM Schools Highlands Ranch at 1:53 p.m. MT. They initially described the situation as unstable and were directing parents to pick up their children at a nearby staging area.
Spurlock said the first officers reached the school two minutes after receiving reports of shots fired at the school. He said he believed their quick response "saved lives."
He offered no information on any possible motivation for the attack nor the suspects' methodology. A handgun was recovered, but Spurlock released no other information about weapons.
The FBI is processing the crime scene. Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Department of Homeland Security are also assisting the investigation.
Earlier, the Douglas County School District announced all schools was on lock down and canceled all after-school activities.
White House spokesman Judd Deere released the following statement on the shooting: "Our prayers are with the victims, family members, and all those affected by today's shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Littleton, Colorado. Tragically, this community and those surrounding it know all too well these hateful and horrible acts of violence. The White House has been in communication with state and local officials, and the President has been briefed and continues to monitor the ongoing situation. We offer our full support to local law enforcement and first responders and thank them for their heroism."

BAGHDAD (AP) — An al-Qaida front group in Iraq has claimed responsibility for the wave of attacks that ripped through markets, cafes and government buildings in Baghdad on a single day last week, killing 69 people and raising new worries about the country's path.
The coordinated attacks struck a dozen mostly Shiite neighborhoods on Thursday in the first major bloodshed since U.S. troops completed a full withdrawal this month after nearly nine years of war. They also coincided with a government crisis that has again strained ties between Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites to the breaking point, tearing at the same fault line that nearly pushed Iraq into all-out civil war several years ago.
The claim of responsibility made no mention of the U.S. withdrawal. Instead, it focused its rage on the country's Shiite-dominated leadership, which Sunni insurgents have battled since it came to power as a result of the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
"The series of special invasions (was) launched ... to support the weak Sunnis in the prisons of the apostates and to retaliate for the captives who were executed," said the statement in the name of the Islamic State of Iraq.
According to the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors jihadist Web traffic, the claim of responsibility was posted late Monday on militant websites.
The group said the attacks were proof that they "know where and when to strike and the mujahedeen will never stand with their hands tied while the pernicious Iranian project shows its ugly face."
The remark was in reference to accusations by Sunni militants that Iraq's Shiite-dominated government has allied itself too closely with neighboring Shiite power Iran, a bitter enemy of Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein.
The Baghdad military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi, said al-Qaida in Iraq — no longer focused on fighting U.S. forces — is hoping to take advantage of the current political tension to re-ignite sectarian warfare.
"It has become a clear scheme to draw Iraq into a sectarian war again," al-Moussawi said. "Al-Qaida in Iraq played a major role in 2005 and 2006 in pushing the county into a civil war and they succeeded."
On Tuesday morning, a car bomb exploded near a police station in the town of Hawija, 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing two civilians and injuring another, said Kirkuk police commander Brig. Gen. Sarhad Qadir.
U.S. and some Iraqi officials have warned of a resurgence of Sunni and Shiite militants and an increase in violence after the U.S. troop withdrawal.
Along with the security challenge, Iraq is facing an increase in political tension as Iraq's Shiite prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is engaged in a showdown with the top Sunni political leader in the country.
Al-Maliki's government has issued an arrest warrant for Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on charges that he ran hit squads against government officials.
Al-Hashemi has denied the charges and said they are politically motivated.

Mayor George Moscone, who announced the reward, vowed the city would “stop at nothing” in the hunt for the men who took part in the Sunday morning attack, which was the worst mass killing in the city's history. The reward was also the highest ever offered by the city. In past, murder cases, the city has offered up to $5,000 for information leading to convictions.
Police Lieut. Daniel Murphy, meanwhile, asserted again that the shooting was the result of a fued between two Chinese youth gangs. Ironically, no members of either gang were injured in the attack, the police said.

On Sept. 18, the operator of a mah jongg game was killed by holdup men. So far, the city's offer of $100,000 reward for information in the killings has gone begging.
In 1974 as the city's night life was cut back sharply by concern over the so‐called Zebra murders of whites by blacks, a proffered reward brought information that led to the conviction of four young blacks.
Spanning 2 Major Anniversaries
The festival, conveniently, will continue through the dates of two important Chinese political anniversaries. Today marks the 28th annnlversary of the Chinese Communist takeover of mainland China, which some here in San Franscisco's Chinese community celebrate; others, who are in sympathy with the Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan, will be celebrating the 66th anniversary Sun Yatsen's declaration of the Republic of China, on Oct. 10.
“That way everybody will be happy,” said a woman clerk at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
The troubles of Chinatown have remained a specter for the general public. Over the last nine years, there have been 45 murders that the police have traced to Chinese gang warfare, and they have one case solved.
One of the gangs here is called the “Joe Boys,” the name tracing to Joe Fong, who was 18 when he went to jail for life five years ago, convicted of conspiracy to commit murder.
Corruption Is Called the Real Evil
In an interview with The San Francisco Examiner last week at a state prison in Tracy, Calif., Mr. Fong said much of the public discussion was nonsense because it ignored the corruption of Chinatown.
“The real crooks stay undisturbed,” he said. Mr. Fong said gambling operates without interference by the police, who, he said, are paid to protect it. He said that in his youth, sympathizers with the Taiwan Government paid young immigrants to disrupt gatherings here of sympathizers with the Red Guard, the youth movement of the Great Cultural Revolution in mainland China in the 1960's, and the immigrants developed taste for such violence.

The San Francisco Police Chief, Charles Gain, said in an interview that he did not question the role of gambling as source of trouble in Chinatown. “Historically, gambling in Chinatown has been looked upon with toleration by elements of the community,” he said.
He said that the problem for his men has been that gambling places “are accepted as part of the environment and no specific complaints are made from the Chinese people, just general complaints. We have to use undercover men to get access for raids and they are soon identified.”.
‘No Knowledge’ of Bribe‐Taking
Before he took office, a Federal task force successfully prosecuted some police officers and Chinese businessmen for bribery and perjury. Speaking of the present, Chief Gain said, “I have no knowledge of any police taking bribes, but when gambling is flagrant and open it is a_ potential for corruption. This is one reason that we are dedicated to knocking it out.”
The chief said he would propose to the San Francisco Police Commission that police officers be forbidden to hold second jobs at places where their police authority may be called into use, such as banks and other places where some officers have second jobs as security guards.""" ;

Spectal to The New York Times
By day, the distinctive and well‐known district is crowded with shoppers and diners. Early evening still finds diners seeking meals.
But the late‐night ambiance that attracted thousands no longer exists since three masked gunmen burst into the Golden Dragon at 2:40 A.M. on Sept. 4, 1977, killing five diners and wounding 11 in what the police described as youth gang warfare. The intended victims, the police said, were eating elsewhere in the same restaurant.
“I just don't go there to eat any more,” said Willie, a bartender in nearby North Beach who was one block away, walking to the Golden Dragon, when the shootings occurred.

However, interviews in this and similar Chinese communities around the nation during the current two‐week celebration of The Year of the Horse, 4676, indicates that they are changing not because of youth violence and fear primarily, but because of basic economics:
Fewer and fewer of the latest immigrants are poor Chinese, forced to seek the crowded housing and low‐paying jobs of Chinatown. And that means its businesses have higher costs and must charge more for the food and souvenirs that attract visitors, thereby losing the competitive edge they have had.""" ;

PHILADELPHIA, April 21 (AP)—A Federal district judge sentenced six Philadelphia homicide detectives today to 15 months in jai for conspiracy to brutalize witnesses in the investigation of a fatal firebombing.
“Fifty percent will say it's too harsh and 50 percent will say it's too lenient,” Judge Donald VanArtsdalen said before sentencing the detectives, who were found guilty last month of violating the civil rights of the witnesses.
A jury found the detectives guilty of conspiring to use force and threats of depriving the witnesses of their children unless the witnesses cooperated in the investigation of the October 1975 firebombing of a house in which a Puerto Rican family of five died. As a resu!t, prosecutors said, an innocent man confessed and served 14 months before another man confessed.

With results from 99 percent of the districts, Mr. Rawlings, a 45-year-old former air force pilot, received 58.7 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Albert Adu Boahen, a history professor, received 30 percent.
It was the first presidential election since Mr. Rawlings seized power in a coup in 1981.
Opposition parties said there was extensive fraud by supporters of Mr. Rawlings, who reluctantly agreed this year to demands for multiparty rule. The accusations included the stuffing of ballot boxes and the altering of results after they were certified locally.
But international observers said the polling, held on Tuesday, was mostly fair.
Protests against the outcome took place today in Kumasi and Accra, where witnesses said police officers had shot into the air and used clubs to scatter several hundred demonstrators, mostly women.

At a press conference in a synagogue opposite Kepiro's Budapest apartment, members of the Simon Wiesenthal Center broke what for him had been 60 years of relative anonymity as they issued copies of a recently rediscovered wartime court verdict. In it, Kepiro was charged and found guilty along with 14 other Hungarian Army and gendarmerie officers of taking part in the Novi Sad massacre in January 1942, during which over a thousand people, the majority of them Jews, were killed.
The atrocity took place over three days during which hundreds of families were rounded up and ultimately shot by machine gun on the shores of the Danube. Their bodies were then dumped into the frozen waters, which had to be broken up by cannon fire.
Although found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison, Kepiro never served his sentence - he was freed by Hungary's fascist regime shortly after his trial in 1944 - and fled to Argentina after the war. In 1946, the Communist government of Hungary tried him again and sentenced him to 14 years in absentia. He returned to Budapest in 1996.""" ;

McNair of South Carolina, the political moderate who was a finalist to become Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey’s running mate in 1968 but whose promising career was cut short by what became known as the Orangeburg Massacre, died last Saturday in Charleston. He was 83.
The cause was brain cancer, O. Wayne Corley, senior shareholder in the McNair Law Firm, announced.
Mr. McNair was remembered as a progressive governor at a time of racial change and social and political upheaval, but the deaths on Feb. 8, 1968, of three black college students from state highway patrol gunfire, and the wounding of 27 others, put an end to his hope of higher office.
Mr. McNair, born Dec. 14, 1923, in the rural Low Country of South Carolina, was buried Tuesday near his childhood home in Berkeley County. As lieutenant governor in 1965, he succeeded Gov. Donald S. Russell, who resigned to take the Senate seat vacated by the death of Olin D. Johnston. Mr. McNair was elected to a full four-year term in 1966.
Mr. McNair received contemporary attention for his deft handling of several tense racial conflicts, including a student protest at the historically black South Carolina State College, now university, in Orangeburg, in the spring of 1967. But then came the shootings the next February.""" ;

What sort of wounds? And, finally, where is the note scrawled by the killers?
Mexico’s drug violence seems to be spiraling out of control, with each mass killing followed by an even gorier one and innocents increasingly falling victim to traffickers’ ruthlessness. Yet there is often a sinister order to the chaos, as killers in Mexico’s drug war frequently leave a calling card with the bodies that spells out a motive for the massacre, or at least their version of it.
That is what has the authorities here puzzling over the two grenades that were hurled into a crowd of innocent revelers in Michoacán State on Independence Day last week, which killed eight people (a 13-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries on Saturday) and wounded more than 100 more. In this case, nobody has claimed responsibility for it. In fact, just the opposite has occurred. La Familia, a violent drug gang based in Michoacán that the authorities have suggested might be responsible, has gone to extraordinary lengths to distance itself from the unprecedented attack on innocents, which has long been considered ungentlemanly behavior among cartel killers.
After the Sept. 15 grenade attack, La Familia sent text messages to reporters disavowing involvement in the killings. The group pledged in pamphlets to strike back at those responsible for harming women and children. And in banners hung around Morelia, Michoacán’s capital, La Familia pointed a finger at the Zetas, a paramilitary group linked to a rival gang.""" ;

— The gunman, wearing a vest loaded with ammunition and carrying four guns, went from town to town, leaving a trail of gruesome crime scenes over 20 miles of rural southern Alabama .
He first killed his mother and the family dogs in Kinston, Ala., the authorities said, then drove 10 miles to Samson, where he shot five members of his extended family, including the uncle who had raised him. Next, his violence became random, as he sprayed bullets at cars, stores and police officers, killing neighbors, a man walking down the street, a woman at a convenience store and a passing motorist, they said.
All told, the gunman, identified as Michael K. McLendon, 28, killed 10 people, in what law enforcement officials called the worst mass shooting in Alabama history, and wounded six before fatally shooting himself.
“He never said a word, all the time he was doing this; never said a word,” said Tom Knowles, a neighbor who saw Mr. McLendon pull up in front of his uncle’s house Tuesday afternoon and begin shooting at family members sitting on porch swings.
Photo
“He had no look on his face, no look at all,” said Mr. Knowles, 51.
Mr. McLendon’s reign of terror, staggering to the close-knit communities here, lasted about 50 minutes, said Kirke Adams, the district attorney for Geneva and Dale Counties. “Crime scenes littered this city,” he said.
“Obviously, this man had some major problems,” Mr. Adams added. “And this town was made to suffer.”
Gary McAliley, the district attorney for Pike and Coffee Counties, which includes Kinston, said witnesses had seen Mr. McLendon become upset with his family ever since his parents divorced. Recently, he had refused to go to a relative’s funeral, Mr. McAliley said, telling a co-worker that the rest of the family had not been supportive to him and his mother.
He had also aggressively tried to get a family Bible, but recently received a letter from a lawyer representing another family member telling him to back off. “He was excessively upset about that,” Mr. McAliley said.
Mr. McLendon was described by those who knew him as a quiet, shy man who had few friends and stayed out of trouble. He had a lifelong fascination with guns, said Cecil Knowles, a classmate and Tom Knowles’s son, and got his first hunting rifle at age 11. Co-workers called him “doughboy,” Mr. McAliley said.
Photo
“Everywhere that he went that he could tote a gun, he would,” Mr. Knowles said. On Tuesday he was armed with a handgun, two assault rifles and a shotgun.
In his house, investigators found survival and military paraphernalia, including bulletproof vests, Mr. McAliley said. And on the dresser in Mr. McLendon’s bedroom they found several lists. One included the names of two dozen employees at Kelley Foods, a sausage maker and food distributor where Mr. McLendon had worked until he quit last week. The list was marked with specific complaints against individuals, like “Reported me for not wearing earplugs,” and “Made me spend four hours clearing out the meat grinder.”
Another law enforcement official cautioned that the list may have been a year old and was not considered a hit list.
A second piece of paper listed the names and addresses of three companies: Kelley; Reliable Products, a metal fabricator where Mr. McLendon worked until 2003; and Pilgrim’s Pride, a meat and egg processing company where his mother worked until she was suspended for an unspecified cause on March 8, Mr. McAliley said. Mr. McLendon’s shooting spree ended at Reliable, where he killed himself, the authorities said.
No one knew why he quit his job at Reliable, where employees said he had a good record.
“He came to work one day and left,” said George Helms, the plant’s human resources manager. “He didn’t have anything to say.”
Photo
In 2003, he tried to become a police officer in Samson. He passed the necessary background check but failed basic training. “He didn’t make it past the first day,” said Becky Payne, an assistant to the director of the Alabama Advanced Criminal Justice Academy.
Clay King, the mayor of Samson, said Mr. McLendon had been a well-behaved child.
“I’ve known him most of my life,” he said. “I coached him in Little League baseball.”

No one considered it unusual that Mr. McLendon collected guns, Mr. King said. “People here hunt a lot,” he said. “They collect a lot of guns. I’ve got probably 30 guns. It’s just kind of a hobby. That part of it wasn’t concerning to me.”
Mr. McLendon was not licensed to carry the automatic weapons but was licensed to carry a pistol, said Chief Frankie Lindsey of the Geneva Police Department.
Mr. McLendon had purchased ammunition for the automatic weapons that morning in Daleville.
He began his rampage at the remote ranch-style house in Coffee County where he lived with his mother, Lisa White McLendon, 52. It appeared he shot her and her dogs, then laid them on and around the couch and soaked them with paint thinner, officials said.
Photo
“He put a pile of clothes and stuff on her, then set the clothes on fire,” said Robert Preachers, the county coroner. “I reckon he thought it would make her burn faster.”
From there, Mr. McLendon drove his Mitsubishi Eclipse south to Samson, to the white frame house where neighbors said he had lived for years with his uncle, James A. White, 55, and aunt, Phyllis White. The Whites were on the porch with their daughter, Tracy M. Wise, 34, her son, Dean, 15, and a family that lived across the street: Andrea D. Myers, 31, the wife of a local sheriff’s deputy, and her two children, 4-month-old Ella and 18-month-old Corrine. Mr. McLendon’s great-aunt, Virginia E. White, 74, was in her trailer parked in Mr. White’s side yard.
Moments later, all but Ella and Phyllis White were dead. Mr. McLendon chased Ms. White, who ran through the house, out the back door, and to a neighbor’s, witnesses said. One witness said Ms. White was saved when Mr. McLendon’s gun jammed.
On Wednesday, with law enforcement officials guarding the house, a handful of people came out the front door to inspect the porch, which had been cleansed of blood. The swings were gone. A woman in a pale green housecoat touched a wall, then bowed, leaning her head against it.
After Mr. McLendon sped off, spraying bullets, Cecil Knowles’s wife, Alina, ran to rescue Ella, who was crying and covered in blood. But Mr. McLendon circled the block and returned, the Knowleses said. Ms. Knowles, a certified nursing assistant, and her father-in-law, Tom Knowles, each hid behind a parked car as Mr. McLendon pointed his gun out the window of his car.
Photo
“I yelled, loud enough that he could hear, ‘I’ve done nothing to you and I don’t know you,’ ” Mr. Knowles said. The gunman drove off again. The baby was later taken to a hospital in Florida for surgery for a gunshot or shrapnel injury.
Nearby, Mr. McLendon killed James I. Starling, who had recently moved his family to Samson, where he worked at a Dollar General . Mr. Starling, 24, had two children and another on the way. He was walking down a nearby street and tried to run but was shot in the back, law enforcement officials said. The gunman rounded the corner onto Main Street, where he killed Sonya Smith, 43, outside a convenience store. Two men, Jeffrey L. Nelson, 50, and Greg McCullough, 49, were injured.
Mr. McLendon continued down Main Street toward the next town, Geneva, and his former employer, Reliable Products. By then, the police were in pursuit, but Mr. McLendon kept shooting, killing Bruce W. Malloy, 51, a motorist.
One officer tried to stop the gunman by ramming his car, but Mr. McLendon fired into his patrol car, narrowly missing him, officials said. He evaded a roadblock and fired at other officers, grazing Chief Lindsey’s shoulder.
The sheriff’s deputy, Josh Myers, who did not know that his wife and child were already dead, was among the officers chasing Mr. McLendon.
“I cried so much yesterday I don’t have a tear left in me,” Mr. Myers told reporters. “It still seems like I should be able to walk into the house and my wife should be there and my baby girl should be climbing on me.”""" ;

The gunman, Specialist Ivan A. Lopez, killed three soldiers and wounded 12 others before taking his own life last April after a confrontation about the handling of his request for leave. In the span of a little more than eight minutes, Specialist Lopez, 34, fired at least 35 rounds at soldiers in a two-block area within Fort Hood in Killeen, shooting at them with a .45-caliber handgun as he walked or drove by.
The investigation effectively cleared the soldier’s superiors and other Fort Hood leaders of any wrongdoing or negligence, recommending specifically that Specialist Lopez’s leaders not receive any adverse action. In the days after the shooting, Army officials had said the primary trigger behind the rampage appeared to have been a dispute over a leave request, and they also said Specialist Lopez was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder. But Friday’s report found that no single event led to the shooting, and that Fort Hood officials were not aware of many of the personal issues that Specialist Lopez was facing, including financial troubles, medical treatments and the deaths of his grandfather and mother.
Specialist Lopez had been undergoing what the report described as a spiritual crisis, which caused him to change his religious preference to atheist and was perhaps aggravated by the deaths of his grandfather and mother. And he was frustrated by the difficulties he faced moving his family from Fort Bliss in El Paso to Fort Hood, where he had arrived just eight weeks before the shooting.""" ;

They identify with their Mexican roots just across the river but identify just as strongly with America. At the formal southern line of the nation, patriotism intensifies, and many an American flag waves in yards and on porches. Young Mexican-American men and women eagerly sign up to become Border Patrol agents. Often, their older relatives and neighbors worked for Border Patrol, and they are proud to do so, too, ignoring the perception of the agency among immigrant families elsewhere in the country.
These working-class and middle-class Mexican-Americans feel compassion for the Central American migrants who have been flooding the border off and on since 2014. Volunteering at migrant shelters and donating clothes and food have become Valley traditions. But many view those migrants as outsiders. The Hispanic migrant in a shelter and the Hispanic longtime Valley resident are culturally and economically disconnected.
Mr. Trump’s support in that context was not surprising.

I don’t find him appealing but I’m fascinated by his appeal to so many Texans.”
The town of Zapata lies along five traffic lights on Highway 83.
Halloween decorations, hay bales and pumpkins were still up on a highway plaza in the aftermath of the election this week. Payday loan, auto parts and pawn shops outnumber gas stations and restaurants. The gentle western slope down to the Rio Grande gives residents spectacular sunsets and views of Mexico. In town and on the more rural roads around the county, where Border Patrol agents can be seen on hilltops gazing through binoculars across the river, there were an equal number of Trump signs and Biden signs.
Two of the few orchestrated Trump events in Zapata happened in September, when stickers and signs were handed out at a local restaurant and a “Trump Train” caravan rode through town.
But they did not draw huge crowds, and even now, some people who supported him said they feared retaliation for speaking out.""" ;

On Thursday, Georgia’s 159 counties finalized a hand recount, technically an audit, of the five million ballots cast in the election, reaffirming Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory but reducing his lead by more than 1,200 votes.
Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, had ordered the manual audit as part of a new state law to ensure the accuracy of voting machines by comparing paper ballot counts with machine tallies. This was not an official recount, though the Trump campaign can choose to request one after the state’s results are certified this week, as the vote margin between Mr. Biden and President Trump is below 0.5 percentage points.
In many counties, officials conducting the audit found zero or single-digit differences in their counts, and they will not change their original results for the state certification process. Yet at least four counties — Douglas, Fayette, Floyd and Walton — discovered missed ballots and will add these to their original counts.
In Douglas, Fayette and Walton Counties, the counting of paper ballots revealed that election workers had undercounted votes after missing memory cards, which held machine-cast votes. New voting machines adopted by the state in 2019 allow voters to use touchscreens to print ballots. The voters then verify the ballots and formally cast them by scanning, resulting in a paper record and a machine tally.
Floyd County officials discovered about 2,400 ballots that election workers neglected to rescan after a scanner failed and results could not be retrieved from memory cards. Officials attributed the error to “gross incompetence” on the part of the county’s elections director.
Despite the errors in these four counties, election officials have said that there are no signs of voter fraud and that the new system is working as intended.
“These people are operating in it under the highest level of stress, in the most contentious election in their work life in the United States and in Georgia. So for the most part they are doing a really good job on this,” said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s statewide voting system implementation manager.""" ;

<https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776> dct:description """Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.
In a statement issued Tuesday following Maryland's decision, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez urged states to not further suspend primaries, but to embrace vote by mail.
"The DNC is urging the remaining primary states to use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike. The simplest tool is vote by mail," Perez said. "States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.”
Perez, as chair of the DNC, has little sway over how individual states actually administer their elections.
Other states are already more prepared to handle the coronavirus outbreak because of their earlier adopting of mail voting. Kansas Democrats, which are holding are party-run primary this year, had already planned on sending out mail ballots to every registered Democrat in the state on March 30. The ballots, which also use ranked-choice voting, need to be postmarked by April 24 ahead of the May 2 primary.
“In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.”
Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.
Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.
Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.
“States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other option is there?’” he said.
But even some proponents of mail balloting worry about a potential rapid switch to a predominantly mail-in system across the country.
“I do think there might be particular challenges to go from in-person voting to almost exclusively vote-by-mail systems,” Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, said.
“Look, if a state can do it … it is probably due diligence at this point to explore the possibility. But that is a major, major change in the midst of an election year,” he added, voicing concern that such major change could potentially disenfranchise some, like low-income or Native American voters, who may not have a fixed address on file with the state.
Ho said that states should, at a minimum, adopt no-excuse absentee voting and make changes in the law to better accommodate voting by mail. Those changes include pushing back the deadline for when mail ballots must be received, allowing election officials to start processing ballots before Election Day, and providing federal funding to support state and local election administrators.
Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer who also supports expanding mail balloting , said there also need to be changes to laws in some states that allow individual poll workers to toss out a mail-in ballot if they think the signature on the envelope doesn’t match the signature on file. Voters’ signatures can change over time, they argue, due to age or a disability.
“It's junk science,” said Elias, who is currently suing Michigan over its signature verification law. “At a minimum, voters need to be notified that someone doesn’t think their signature doesn’t match and given an opportunity to fix it.”
Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.”
The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.""" ;

<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/03/whoever-wins-iowa-wont-be-back-110439> dct:description """That won’t be the case this year. A new sentiment has echoed throughout recent conversations with Democratic strategists, activists and campaigns, a consensus that would have been unthinkable just eight years ago: Iowa is no longer a battleground. Not in 2020, anyway.
After decades spent at the center of both parties’ strategies for winning the Electoral College, Iowa is suddenly an afterthought. Its six electoral votes no longer seem essential, not when states like Texas and Arizona and Georgia — longtime GOP strongholds — all were decided by tighter margins in 2016, and all have demographic tailwinds that benefit the Democratic Party.
Few states received more time and attention from Barack Obama during his White House campaigns than Iowa. Part of that was due to its pride of place in his political ascent; Iowa, after all, was the state that vaulted him from long shot to Clinton slayer. But there also was as widespread view then that Iowa was up for grabs in November. Now, less than five years removed from his presidency, Democrats talk openly about not contesting the state at all.

“The trends here are much more red than purple. I could see that swinging back at some point, but probably not with Trump on the ballot,” says Ben Foecke, who served as executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party four years ago. “It became clear to us in 2016 that this was the path we were heading down, at least in the short term, so I'm not surprised when I hear these conversations or read these memos explaining that Iowa isn’t really a swing state in 2020."
At a glance, this fatalism might seem exaggerated. Democrats carried the state in six of the seven presidential contests before Trump came along, and the one exception — George W. Bush’s victory in 2004 — was decided by 1 percentage point. Even today, the RealClearPolitics average of general election polling shows Trump leading Joe Biden by just 3 points and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders by 6 points apiece —hardly the indicators of a blowout.
Moreover, there’s recent history to consider: Democrats flipped two Republican-held congressional seats in the 2018 midterms, giving the party control of three of the state’s four districts, and also won a number of bellwether legislative races in the suburban areas around Des Moines. These victories, on top of ousting the Republican state auditor, gave some Democrats confidence of being able to compete statewide with Trump’s apparatus in 2020.
And yet, embedded in those 2018 results were trend lines that demonstrate just how distinct Trump’s advantage in Iowa has become. Despite overall midterm turnout spiking by some 180,000 votes, Republicans were able to hold both chambers of the Legislature and several statewide offices, including the governorship, all while growing their advantage in active party registration. The reason: Even in a terrible environment for the GOP, driven by suburbanites fleeing the party, Republicans performed even better in rural areas than they did in the 2014 cycle, one of the best in modern history for the party.
“Joni Ernst ran up significant margins in rural Iowa in a great Republican year in 2014,” explains David Kochel, the longtime Iowa GOP strategist who led the senator’s campaign. “But the Trump effect put those margins on steroids to such an extent that [Gov.] Kim Reynolds won many counties in a bad Republican year at even higher margins than Ernst.”
Officials from different parties who studied these 2018 results reached a similar conclusion: That Republicans can afford to continue bleeding support in 11 of the state’s 99 counties, as Reynolds did, so long as they continue to expand their dominance of the remaining 88 counties. For all the talk of Iowa becoming younger, more diverse, more metropolitan, the fact is that no party in the foreseeable future can hope to win the presidency while getting crushed among the older, white voters from rural areas, a segment of voters that makes up the backbone of the state’s electorate.
“We absolutely cannot concede rural America. We did that in 2016 and 2018, and it didn't work,” says Patty Judge, Iowa’s former Democratic lieutenant governor. “The lesson for Democrats is, we’ve got to listen to what's going on in the heartland, to understand that people feel they've been left behind, that they’re having a hard time aligning themselves with some of what they hear from the Democratic Party right now. Until we understand that, we can't get back to being a blue state—or at least, back to a purple state that voted for Barack Obama twice.”
Indeed, Obama’s twin victories in Iowa — including a relative blowout by 9½ points in 2008 —continues to fuel a stubborn optimism among Democrats here who believe Trump’s win, by an identical 9½ point margin, was something of a fluke. But there is no denying how fundamentally the politics of the state, and the country, changed over those eight years. The sorting and self-selection of voters accelerated all over the country at an unprecedented clip, leading to a polarized electorate and a predictability of outcomes that has gradually shrunken the battleground map in presidential races. For the same reasons Republicans won’t be competitive in Virginia and Colorado this fall, Democrats aren’t expected to put up a fight in Iowa.
“We knew Barack Obama would not be president of the United States without winning the Iowa caucuses, so we threw everything at it. Did that have ancillary benefits in the fall? Of course — he had such visibility there,” says David Axelrod, the chief strategist of Obama’s campaigns. “What's different for the Democrats today is that we're so much more polarized now than we were then. The breaks around geography and demography are really stark in the era of Trump, and because of that, Iowa becomes a more difficult state. So does the whole region, really.”

To some Democrats, that is precisely the reason Iowa should lose its place at the front of the nominating calendar: A state that remains predominantly white, working-class and culturally conservative does not reflect the party, nor does it look like the future of the national electorate.
Then again, maybe this is exactly why Iowa should go first.
“Competing in Iowa, if nothing else, should be a great training exercise for Democrats to win in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. If you can win over some of the swing voters here, you can win them over there,” says Pat Rynard, a former Iowa Democratic staffer who runs the popular blog IowaStartingLine.com. “So even if the Democratic nominee doesn't come back to Iowa in the fall, they've at least learned some key lessons here that will help them win those other states—and hopefully, the Electoral College.”""" ;

"Hot. Excited. Lovable. Dark. Interesting."
- Carl Cox, WMC 2005
"If it's already packed and you're still paying three times over the odds...that for me doesn’t sound appealing. Carl Cox or not, I'm not paying!"
- Carl Cox, WMC 2005
"Great music, great set but...I'd like to get you involved in a concept of mine called Pussy Vodka."
- Ultra Music Festival Clubber
Few would argue that the Carl Cox Global Arena tent at the Ultra Music Festival at this year’s Winter Music Conference was one of the standouts of the weeklong music mayhem. Organised by his own team of people with the line-up handpicked and programmed by Carl himself it was clearly evident that great lengths had been undertaken to give festival goers a truly memorable experience.In the next installment of our WMC Perspectives series, Carl reveals why it usually takes him 30 minutes to “do” his head (not hair) before his Global Arena performances: the importance of getting in Miami clubs and especially BED, before ten; why he won’t be getting any free Pussy in the near future and last but not least, why you shouldn’t believe everything you read - think flyers not RA.This weekend Carl will be doing his first ever Carl Cox Live Performance show at The Ahoy in Rotterdam, which will see him play on the decks and also perform some of his own productions live.If you want me to be as bold as brass I think Ultra was absolutely amazing. I really thought the crowd, even in that heat, really stayed with me and the other DJs and stayed with the concept of the tent - the music that I wanted people to listen to.The last two Ultras I’ve played I’ve had a good time but at this Ultra I was able to control exactly what I wanted people to hear; people who were paying good money to come and hear great DJs. You need a good sound system, a good area to dance in and they need a place where they can feel safe and know they’re going to get great music all day along.As far as I’m concerned the Carl Cox Global Arena at Ultra was by far one of the best things about being there and that’s just not my point of view. I think everyone would say the same. I gave the very best performance I could at the Winter Music Conference at Ultra that you couldn’t see at my performance at Crobar. They’re two different animals. I was a bit more subdued then and probably a bit tired cos I gave all my energy to the Ultrafest. So out of the two, my gig at Ultra was the best for me.I do like BED. I do like the concept of that whole club. From a DJ’s point of view you’re right in the middle of it all. People can see you; there’s no hiding from anyone there. Everyone goes into that club; from people who can afford to be there to people who can’t afford to be there but are there anyway and are there for the music more than anything else, rather than the food and the women.It’s something that a DJ can totally get their teeth into. You can sway a lot of people’s ideas about what a DJ actually does because you’re creating the atmosphere for that night. BED for me is an outstanding venue. I just like it cos it’s a cool place to be as well without being too snobby. People are still dancing, getting up and enjoying themselves and that’s what I like to see in any club but there, in particular, is just outstanding.I didn’t really get around to much so I didn’t really hear too many people playing different things. From my point of view there was one record which I really really wanted people to hear at Ultrafest by this Japanese artist called Hiroki Esashika which I’ve signed to Intec Records. The record is called Kazane. He made this record about 4 or 5 months ago. It’s the first Japanese artist that I’ve signed and this record is kind of like electro-clash but has this amazing sound in the middle of it.It really did absolutely rock it at both venues and so showed me from a club point of view or from a stadium point of view, that this record works really well. This, for me was the record which really kind of nailed it, in the sense of hearing something new and fresh out of all the records I played. There were other moments as well which were fantastic but this record, I have to say, made DJs come up to me and just ask me what it was, something which also made an impact.I would have liked to have seen a few more live performances cos the conference is very DJ-lead. I think that’s something that should always be a staple diet of showcasing new music, new talent, new artists coming through. There are millions of DJs but I still want to see the next Aretha Franklin, the next Prodigy, the next Moby and there are not many people who are actually, from a band point of view, showcasing themselves well. It doesn’t matter if ten people turn up. As long as you perform it’s OK.What I’m going to do from next year is have a Carl Cox concept where I’m able to perform some of the records that I’ve also created live - just turn off the music and go right, here’s the performance - in front of four, five thousand people and just see what happens. It’s an experience and that’s what I’d like to see more of, so if no one does it then I will.In fact I’m already doing it this weekend where I’m playing for 10000 people in Rotterdam and doing a Carl Cox Live Performance show; something I wasn’t able to do this year at Ultrafest cos I wasn’t ready. But next year, I certainly will be.If it’s already packed and you’re still paying three times over the odds to go into a place which you won’t be able to see the DJ, can’t get a beer and can’t go to the toilet that for me doesn’t sound appealing.Carl Cox or not, I’m not paying!All I can say is going early enough is the only thing you can do to make sure or guarantee yourself getting into that night because most of the problems only really happen over 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning since the club has been open since 9 or 10 o’clock.A lot of my friends didn’t even get into my night even at Crobar and ended up partying somewhere else. The one’s that went early did but the ones that rocked up and wanted to get in were subjected to paying the doorman. But they didn’t do it; they went home!There are actually two of those heads, which we had built for our party that we did at Dance Valley in Holland last year, which floated above the stage. I think both of them take about half an hour each and a guy called Jim Baggott, who is my production manager on-site, has the task of doing that.Even so they don’t actually look like me. From a distance they look OK but close-up look completely like someone else. Can you imagine actually having the task of making that? You know trying to get it right. And obviously they didn’t get it completely right but it’s kind of close enough. The idea is that it’s a bit of fun and it’s nice to put a bit of fun back into the room.There was one rumour - and there were flyers as well - that I was doing a pool party and people had to pay $15 to get in and the money was going to some sort of charity. I was in Minneapolis, not even anywhere near Miami at the time but I actually know who did it and how it all happened.I was speaking to Danny “LTJ” Bukem, who’s a very good friend of mine, and he was involved in this party. It wasn’t that he wanted to scam this party at all, just that he thought that I would be there at the conference and would be able to do that party. But what he didn’t do was speak to my management based on if I could actually do that party. They took it as gospel and that I was going to be there so they put these flyers out and I became the headlining DJ for this party!To tell you the truth I had people ringing me up and people going down and ringing me up and asking “What time are you playing? ”. I was like “I’m in Minneapolis!” It was ridiculous. It was just miscommunication on their behalf based on that they should have checked with my relevant people before putting out such a campaign.I didn’t say, “Yes I’ll be there and I’ll do it.” It was more like “I would like to do it but speak to my management. So that’s what happened.I had some really great comments from fans and people who really enjoyed me being there. But there was one guy that came up to me and was asking me about getting involved with a thing called Pussy Vodka. And how it would be a really good idea for me to get involved because you can earn ‘Pussy Points’ by how much vodka you drink.
[Carl is also known to drink Bonk coffee... – RA Ed]
It’s unbelievable, completely, based on the fact that someone came up to me and said “Great music, great set but I’ve got this great idea for you. I’d like to get you involved in a concept of mine called Pussy Vodka.” I was like where does this all come from? What can you benefit from by calling a vodka Pussy? It was a no-go from that point but he was adamant that this was a really great thing. It’s kind of like calling the next wave of computers, Orange instead of Apple cos it’d be a great idea. So that was incredible and kind of interesting to say the least!Hot. Excited. Lovable. Dark. Interesting.

Organizers said 10,000 tickets had been sold for the Danish leg of the Eurovision Song Contest due to be held on Saturday at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen.
“Authorities urge organizers to postpone or cancel events with more than 1000 participants,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a press conference.
Denmark has 21 confirmed cases of people infected with coronavirus. The Nordic country has not had any deaths, and one person had recovered, health authorities said on Friday.
The Danish Football Association said all Superliga games would be played this weekend without spectators while football club FC Copenhagen said it would play its three scheduled home games in March in an empty stadium, including a UEFA Europa League game against Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir.

After postponing its convention at the start of COVID-19’s outbreak in Virginia, the Republican Party of Virginia has set a new date for the assembly.
The party announced Tuesday that it will hold an unassembled convention from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Aug. 15, more than three months later than its original May 1-2 date.
Party delegates from across the state will be assigned a polling place within the state’s 11 congressional districts — locations that the districts’ committees will propose and the party’s central committee will approve.
Delegates will vote for a state chairperson, among other things. That race will be decided by ranked-choice voting, an emerging practice that Virginia lawmakers signed off on for local elections during this year’s General Assembly session.
Candidates for the head of the party and other races will speak to delegates virtually four days before the convention, the party said in a news release.
The polling locations will be ratified by July 11, according to the party.
The convention had been scheduled for early May at the Greater Richmond Convention Center.""" ;

<https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_news_politics_feb_2020> dct:description """In possible November election matchups, each of the Democratic candidates leads President Donald Trump in Virginia according to latest The Roanoke College Poll. However, the better-known Democrats are not viewed much more favorably than Trump. The Institute for Policy and Opinion Research interviewed 520 potential Virginia1 voters between February 9 and February 18 and has a margin of error of + 4.3 percent.
Democratic Candidates vs. Trump
Sanders 49% Trump 40%
Biden 48% Trump 40%
Warren 48% Trump 41%
Buttigieg 47% Trump 40%
Bloomberg 46% Trump 40%
Klobuchar 46% Trump 39%
*choices were rotated in the questions
Although each of the Democratic candidates named in the poll holds a lead over Trump of between 6 and 9 percentage points, the better-known candidates are even or “underwater” in terms of favorable/unfavorable ratings. Only Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have a higher percentage of favorable than unfavorable ratings, but for both the plurality of respondents were unable to give them a rating.
Favorability ratings
Favorable Unfavorable Donald Trump 32% 54% Ralph Northam 27% 34% Joe Biden 37% 37% Bernie Sanders 35% 40% Elizabeth Warren 29% 41% Pete Buttigieg 31% 26% Michael Bloomberg 26% 39% Amy Klobuchar 27% 20%
*Democratic candidates were rotated in the questions
President Trump, Direction of the Country and Commonwealth, Governor Northam
A majority of Virginians (52%) disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job, while just over one-third (36%) approve. The 36 percent figure matches the second highest approval rating for Trump in the Roanoke College Poll since he took office. Trump was viewed favorably by 32% of respondents while 54% viewed him unfavorably. Respondents were evenly split between agreeing with the Senate’s acquittal of President Trump in the impeachment trial (45%) and thinking he should have been removed from office (45%).
A majority (53%) of respondents think the country is on the wrong track, while 39 percent think it is headed in the right direction. This is significantly more positive than the most recent measurement in November 2019 when 65% said the country was on the wrong track. Three-fifths (60%) disapprove of the way Congress is doing its job, and that is the lowest disapproval in three years. The 20 percent who approve of Congress matches its high in February 2017.
Approval for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was up to 40 percent, but disapproval stands at 41 percent, which is higher than immediately after the governor’s “blackface” scandal broke. Northam was viewed favorably by 27% of respondents while 34% view him unfavorably. Four-in-10 (41%) respondents approve of the way the General Assembly is doing its job, while 38 percent disapprove. Just less than half (49%) of respondents think that Virginia is headed in the right direction while 44 percent think it is on the wrong track.
“Vexit,” the possible secession/annexation of several Virginia counties into neighboring West Virginia was supported by 20 percent of respondents but opposed by 62 percent.
Gun control
Gun control has been a dominating issue in this session of the General Assembly, and opinion regarding the issue has changed very little. A plurality said it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns (48%) than to control gun ownership (41%). A majority said that a gun in the possession of a law-abiding citizen is more likely to be used in self-defense (63%) than in an accidental shooting (24%). A plurality of those responding (34%) thought that stricter gun laws would make them safer, while 25 percent said stricter laws would make them less safe. Those responses show significant stability over several years, except the percentage that believes stricter laws would make them less safe more than doubled since we asked the question in 2013.

Only 5% said they were undecided about their vote, and 3% percent said they would vote for another candidate. Almost 90% of those who support either candidate are very certain of their vote intention. The lead was 12 points in the May Roanoke College Poll. U.S. Senator Mark Warner leads Daniel Gade, his Republican opponent (55%-34%). The Institute for Policy and Opinion Research interviewed 566 likely Virginia voters[1] between August 9 and August 22 and has a margin of error of +4.1%. More than 9 out of 10 (94%) said they care a great deal who wins the presidential election in November, and 97% said it was very likely they would vote.
More than 90% of Democrats said they would vote for Biden, while just under 90% of Republicans said they would vote for Trump. Only 2% of Democrats said they would cross over to vote for Trump while 7% of Republicans said they plan to vote for Biden.
A note regarding timing of this poll: It is possible that being in the field during the Democratic National Convention had an impact on the results. National polls in 2020 have generally shown no “bounce” for Biden and conventional wisdom is that such bounces have been declining in recent elections and that this year is so different in so many ways that there may not be a bounce. The 53%-39% Biden lead here is not significantly different from his 51%-39% lead in the May Roanoke College Poll. See a note in the topline for how the samples before and during/after the convention differed.
Trump, Biden, the U.S. Senate race, and the Country
A majority of Virginians (58%) disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job, while just over one-third (37%) approve. That 37% figure is the second-highest approval rating for Trump in the Roanoke College Poll since he took office, and the 58% ties his highest disapproval.
Trump’s favorable/unfavorable rating is 37%/55% while Biden is at 51%/38%. Trump’s numbers are fairly consistent, but Biden’s favorable rating is up 15 points since May, while his unfavorable declined by 1%. A majority of likely voters (58%) see the election as a decision on the future of the country, while almost one-third (31%) see it as a referendum on President Trump.
More than three-fourths (79%) of respondents think the country is on the wrong track (a Roanoke College Poll record), while only 16% think it is headed in the right direction.
On the issues, Trump is slightly favored to do a better job on the economy (50-46%), but trails Biden badly on handling race relations (64%-29%), protests and civil unrest (58%-36%), and on COVID-19 (56%-38%). Likely voters see the economy as the most important issue in the election (26%) ahead of COVID-19 (13%) with a host of other concerns registering under 10%.
Asked about their vote in 2016, 85% reported voting in the presidential election with 46% saying they voted for Hillary Clinton and 42% saying they voted for Donald Trump (the official result in Virginia was Clinton 50%, Trump 44%).
Mark Warner’s favorable rating is 51%, up 14 points since May, while his unfavorable rating rose from 21% in May to 26% in August. Daniel Gade, his Republican challenger, is largely unknown with two-thirds of likely voters (67%) not knowing enough to have an opinion of him. Positively, his favorable rating of 20% doubles his unfavorable rating of 10%.
Governor Northam and the Commonwealth
Job approval for Virginia Governor Ralph Northam sits at 53%, down from his high of 59% in May, while 41% disapprove of his performance (tied for second highest disapproval rating of his tenure as governor). Almost half (49%) of respondents think that Virginia is on the wrong track (another record high), while 45% think it is headed in the right direction. Yet Northam was viewed favorably by 45% of respondents and was seen unfavorably by 38% (his highest unfavorable in the Roanoke College Poll).
Race relations
Two-thirds (66%) of likely voters think race relations in the United States are fairly bad or very bad. To improve race relations, a plurality (47%) thinks it is more important to focus on what different racial and ethnic groups have in common, while 37% think we should focus on the unique experiences of different groups.
Asked about their personal experiences, more than six in ten (61%) said they rarely or never see acts of discrimination when they are in public. Another third (32%) said they see acts of discrimination sometimes, and 5% said they see them often.
Majorities agreed that racial discrimination is built into society (61%), that racism comes from individuals who hold racist views, not from our institutions (60%), and what may seem like intentional discrimination often is something bad that can and does happen to people of all colors (58%). Just over half (51%) hold a favorable view of Black Lives Matter. Some of these questions were asked on a July 2020 NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll that obtained similar results.
A majority of respondents (56%) think the Founding Fathers were great men, while 21% think they were mostly looking out for their own interests, including protecting slavery, and another 12% think they were both.""" ;

President Trump, Direction of the Country and Commonwealth, Governor Northam
A majority of Virginians (54%) disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job, while just over one-third (36%) approve. That 36 percent figure matches the February Roanoke College Poll’s second-highest approval rating for Trump since he took office.
A majority (61%) of respondents think the country is on the wrong track, while 33 percent think it is headed in the right direction, which is significantly more negative than the last measurement in February 2020. Three-fifths (63%) disapprove of the way Congress is doing its job. The 20 percent who approve of Congress matches its high in February 2020 and three years prior to that.
Job approval for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam soared to 59 percent, up from 40 percent in February, while 29 percent disapprove of his performance. More than half (57%) of respondents think that Virginia is headed in the right direction while 37 percent think it is on the wrong track. Northam was viewed favorably by 46 percent of respondents, up from 27 percent in February and the highest of his term. He was seen unfavorably by 31 percent, down only slightly from February.
For comparison, we included New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on our list for favorable/unfavorable (43% favorable; 24% unfavorable). It is interesting that his numbers are close to those of Senator Warner, but the percentage of respondents who don’t know enough about the person to have an opinion is 30 percent for Warner compared to only 24 percent for Cuomo.
Political anxiety
IPOR continues to track political anxiety in the Commonwealth. More than eight in 10 (81%) of Virginians trust the federal government to do what is right only some of the time or never. For the first time in measuring the variable, a plurality (49%) thinks there is not much ordinary citizens can do to influence the federal government. Half (50%) think their side is losing more than winning in politics today.
Most respondents (60%) think the country’s best years are ahead, while just under one-third (31%) think its best years have passed. Overall, a large majority of Virginians (86%) continue to see the nation divided regarding the important issues facing the United States.
Nearly half of respondents (49%) are dissatisfied with how the federal government is (or isn’t) working. Another 19 percent are angry, while only 25 percent are satisfied, and 3 percent are enthusiastic. Each of these measures has remained relatively constant over time, but responses of subgroups vary. This poll saw the lowest level of political efficacy we have seen in three years of measurements, but slightly higher optimism for the future.""" ;

<https://www.rt.com/news/369124-caucasus-isis-leader-killed-fsb/> dct:description """A Dagestan-based militant leader who swore allegiance to Islamic State (IS, ISIS/ISIL), was picked as “emir” by IS chief al-Baghdadi and was linked to terrorist acts in Russia’s Volgograd, has been eliminated, the Federal Security Service (FSB) said.
“Rustan Magomedovich Aselderov (Abu Muhammad), born in 1981, the leader of the Vilayat Kavkaz section of the Islamic State international terrorist group, was among the militants eliminated alongside four of his close associates,” the FSB said in a statement.
The terrorist cell was neutralized near the southern Russian city of Makhachkala, the capital of the Republic of Dagestan.

Aselderov and four other militants were found hiding out in a house in the village. After the hideout was surrounded, the police started negotiations and asked the militants to surrender. In response, the terrorists fired automatic weapons and were killed by return fire. None of the officers taking part in the operation were injured.
A large cache of weapons was then discovered in the hideout, including automatic rifles, munitions and explosives.
The FSB said Aselderov was one of the organizers of the terrorist attack on Volgograd’s train station on December 29, 2013, which killed 18 people and left dozens injured after a suicide bomber blew herself up at the station’s entrance. Another suicide bomber targeted civilians in a Volgograd trolleybus on December 30, killing 16 people and injuring 25 others.
“From all the terrorist acts carried out by [Aselderov and his henchmen] the terrorist acts targeting public transport and railway station in Volgograd, which inflicted multiple casualties, are the bloodiest,” the FSB said in a statement.

But Aselderov is also suspected to be complicit in the double explosions that hit the Astrakhan-Makhachkala highway in May 2012, killing 40 people and injuring over a hundred.
The militant was also involved in the planning of a foiled terrorist attack on Moscow’s Red Square, in which two female suicide bombers were supposed to detonate on December 31, 2010. The plot was uncovered by the FSB.
He is also believed to be behind the murder of an imam in the village of Karamakhi, Dagestan and the killing of the same village’s head in 2015.
Aselderov has been known to Russian law enforcement as an active member of Dagestan terrorist cells since 2007. In 2012, he became in charge of Dagestan’s unit of the internationally recognized terrorist organization “Imarat Kavkaz.” In 2014, he was “one of the first” to pledge allegiance to Islamic State.
In late June 2015, Aselderov was appointed the head of the so-called Vilayat Kavkaz, established on the Russian territory by Islamic State, on the orders of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Among his “duties” as an emir were the planning of terrorist acts in Russia’s Northern Caucasus and in central Russia, the FSB said.
In September 2015, the US Treasury imposed economic sanctions on Aselderov adding him to the list of specially designated global terrorists. He was also included in UN Security Council’s sanctions list and was wanted internationally.""" ;

Montaigne has been crowned the winner of Eurovision – Australia Decides during the Live TV Final on SBS on Saturday 8 February.
The 24 year old Sydney-based artist took to the stage to perform her song 'Don’t Break Me', alongside some of Australia’s biggest names in music. The scores of the viewing public and jury were combined for the official results.
After winning over the Australian public with 53 points and a jury of industry experts with 54 points, an impressive 107 points overall, Montaigne has been selected to represent Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and broadcast live and exclusive on SBS in May 2020.
In a nail-biting finish, Casey Donovan took out second place with 100 points overall, leading the public vote by seven points with her anthem of self-respect and acceptance Proud. While Vanessa Amorosi came in third place with her power ballad Lessons of Love with 82 points overall. Montaigne said: “This is wild! I started out just grateful to be a part of Eurovision but this is fricken insane! Thank you to everyone who gave me their vote, I’m so excited to go to Rotterdam and give it a red hot go!”
SBS Commissioning Editor and Australian Head of Delegation Josh Martin said: “Australia has made their choice! And what an incredibly exciting and original choice it is. This is a game changer for our Eurovision journey. Montaigne is an incredibly talented artist, full of strength and integrity who will bring a new audience to Eurovision. It will be so exciting to see how she can evolve this performance for the much larger stage in Rotterdam in May. Fun times ahead!”
Creative Director of Eurovision – Australia Decides and Director of Blink TV Paul Clarke said: “Montaigne is a total original. Her song had the best contemporary pop sound, and it was a shot performance – the first ever at Eurovision. We are delighted that Casey Donovan won the public vote with a song from talented songwriter Justine Elkatchi in a very tight contest. It was a hugely successful night and thanks to everyone who took part, SBS and our Queensland partners. Congrats to Montaigne!”
In association with the Queensland Government via Tourism and Events Queensland, the City of Gold Coast, Screen Queensland, APRA AMCOS, Moroccanoil and accommodation partner QT Gold Coast, Eurovision – Australia Decides was presented at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre to a live audience.
Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said: “Wow, what a night! So many wonderful performances and so much talent being showcased right here on the Gold Coast. Our city’s exposure to this global audience is priceless and I can’t wait to see Montaigne perform against all of Europe.”

We celebrate the 2020 artists and songs with Eurovision 2020: Big Night In! premiering Saturday 16 May at 7.30pm. SBS is inviting fans to vote for their favourite three 2020 acts from all competing nations* and watch as we countdown the results over three big hours. Voting has now closed and results are being tallied.
Hosted by Eurovisionaries music buff Myf Warhurst and comedian Joel Creasey, the must-see TV event will feature special guest appearances from big names across the globe and an exclusive studio performance from our very own Montaigne, giving audiences the first look at the performance she would have unveiled in Rotterdam next month.
Uniting our dedicated Eurovision audience watching from home, viewers can join the conversation and have the chance to see their tweets and lounge room party pics on screen during Eurovision 2020: Big Night In! by using #SBSEurovision #BigNightIn.
Airing on SBS on Sunday 17 May at 8.30pm will be the special two-hour program Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light hosted by Dutch Eurovision presenters Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley and Jan Smit. Broadcast from The Netherlands, Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light will honour all 41 songs in a non-competitive format and provide plenty of surprises for fans at home.
“Sixty-four years ago, Eurovision was born as an idea to help unite people after a period of turmoil and instability. In 2020, SBS is incredibly proud to fill the gap left from the cancellation of this year’s contest in Rotterdam, with a network event that champions the very same goal,” said Josh Martin, SBS Commissioning Editor and Australian Head of Delegation.
“Music really is the great unifier and a perfect antidote for a nation in isolation. We’ve already seen this through the thousands of apartment block singalongs and virtual choirs and, in this spirit, we promise this will be a fun, exciting and inclusive party that everyone is invited to!

TO: Interested Parties
FROM: Brock McCleary
Date: September 2, 2020RE: Key Poll Findings—Minnesota Statewide Survey
Harper Polling conducted a survey of 501 likely voters in Minnesota via landline and cell phone interviews conducted
with live operators at a professional call center. The survey was completed August 30-September 1, 2020 and has a
margin of error of +/-4.38%. The following memo covers key findings from the survey.
Summary: Since May, Jason Lewis has narrowed the race from a +11% Smith advantage to just +2%. A
similar trend is seen up-ballot with the Presidential race. Tina Smith’s recent comments about the role
police play in our society are unpopular with her constituents, particularly with voters in the outer Metro
counties.

<https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190728/seabrooks-abramson-seeks-libertarian-presidential-nomination> dct:description """SEABROOK — Hundreds of long-shot candidates have filed to run for president in the 2020 election. With reasons ranging from fame and notoriety to faith, they can make a political difference.
Seabrook's Max Abramson believes he can win the Libertarian presidential nomination at the party's convention in Austin, Texas, next May. The 43-year-old state representative was elected in 2018 as a Republican but switched parties because he disagreed with certain GOP values. He notes he is the only two-term Libertarian legislator among those running for the nomination. He also touts his 31,234 votes in the 2016 New Hampshire gubernatorial race, which guaranteed ballot access for Libertarians in the state's 2018 elections.
"I think I have the best chance of any of the candidates for winning (the Libertarian nomination)," said Abramson, who said his main platform is to bring troops home and cut the country's $23 trillion debt.
There are more than 700 people who filed with the Federal Elections Commission as presidential candidates for the 2020 election so far, candidates expected to do so when their contributions or expenditures rise above $5,000. The candidates lacking name recognition, sometimes called "fringe candidates," come from a wide range of places and political backgrounds. One filed under the name "Chocolate Pancakes."
University of New Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala compared the long shots to people trying to win the lottery. Some do it just for fun, while others have high hopes.
"Sometimes because they believe, why can't that happen to me?" said Scala. "It's basically like they're living the dream, like someone who buys the lottery ticket."
The definition of success, he said, is in the eye of the beholder. Abramson, for example, said the goal is not necessarily to win the presidency but to get as many Libertarians as possible elected to seats as legislators across the country.
"'Whats the measuring stick?' is a good question," said Scala.
Abramson's opponents include one of the most well known fringe candidates - Vermin Supreme, who wears a boot on his head and pushes for tooth-brushing laws, ponies for everyone and zombie apocalypse awareness. He has been a perennial presidential candidate since 2004 and famously held a "pony parade" with live ponies outside a Hillary Clinton book signing in Concord in 2017.
Supreme's character has historically been viewed as political satire, but he said this year he is running an "actual campaign" for the Libertarian nomination.
"Do I still stand by my pony pledge? Yes sir, I do," Supreme clarified. He still plans to wear the boot and maintain the more outrageous aspects of his character, but having previously filed as a Republican and a Democrat, he said his personal values line up with the Libertarian party.
"Put together, I believe that we would be an unstoppable force," Supreme said of himself and the party.
Abramson and Supreme will not appear on the New Hampshire Primary ballot in 2020, though they would have if the New Hampshire gubernatorial candidate had gained at least 4 percent of the vote in 2018 as Abramson did in 2016. That is New Hampshire's threshold for party access to the ballot, determined each governor's race for the following election cycle, according to New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner.
Gardner said there is an ongoing dispute over what people should call the long shot candidates, saying he prefers "the lesser-knowns." He said a debate has been held every four years at the Saint Anselm College since 1972 over the proper name for the lesser known candidates, the most recently one broadcast on C-SPAN.
Gardner said New Hampshire is unique in its access to its primary ballot. Those whose parties are eligible to appear on it can pay $1,000 to enter the presidential race. He said people filing independently to run for president must acquire and turn in 3,000 nomination papers filled out and signed by supporters.
In other states, he said secretaries of state choose who will appear on the ballot, which he said has led to lawsuits in those states. He said New Hampshire's primary was passed into law so candidates from all backgrounds could run against those with wealth and name recognition.
"That's what it's all about," said Gardner. "Its all about a place that someone can come to without being the most famous or the most wealthy and have a chance.\"""" ;

<https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/10/31/trump-up-over-biden-new/> dct:description """President Donald Trump’s lead over Joe Biden in Utah has narrowed slightly since the beginning of October, though he’s still on track to claim the state’s six electoral votes.
Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden, 51% to 44%, according to a new survey from Y2 Analytics released Saturday. A poll from the same firm in early October found Trump ahead 50% to 40% . The surge in Biden’s support comes during a prolonged and worsening spike in coronavirus cases both in Utah and nationwide. About 5% of voters said they planned to vote for someone else.
Y2 pollster Quin Monson cautions against interpreting the results as a surge in support for Biden in the Beehive State.
“The presidential race has been quite stable nationally, and I think it’s actually been quite stable in Utah,” he said.
A better interpretation is the numbers demonstrate just how unpopular the president is in Republican-dominated Utah. In 2016, Trump carried the state with 45.5%, but independent candidate Evan McMullin captured nearly 22% that year. This year, there’s no third-party option capturing a significant amount of support, yet Trump isn’t polling much higher than he was four years ago.
The poll found 48% of likely Utah voters said they would “definitely” vote for Trump, while 40% said the same for the Democratic candidate. Just 2% of Trump and Biden voters said they could change their minds before they cast a ballot.
Utah Democratic Party Chair Jeff Merchant said the numbers show there may be a political realignment happening in the state.
“We’ve been saying for years that Utah is quickly transitioning to a purple state. The last national Democrat to break 40 percent was Lyndon B Johnson. For Joe Biden to be at 44 percent shows both his strength as a candidate and the loosening grip Republicans have on Utah politics,” he said.
Derek Brown, Utah GOP Chair, wasn’t worried about the single-digit margin in the poll.
“As a party, we fully expect the President to easily win his election here in Utah. Most polls tend to underestimate the President’s general level of support across the board," he said.
Trump will undoubtedly outpace his 2016 performance in Utah this year, but it appears the race will be closer here than it was four years ago. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 18 points four years ago, but Biden is set to massively improve on Clinton’s performance. That’s primarily a function of the absence of McMullin on the ballot. The Y2 survey found that voters who went for McMullin four years ago are splitting their vote evenly between Trump and Biden, with 45% set to cast a ballot for Trump and 45% going to Biden.
Utah’s electoral competitiveness may raise some eyebrows this year, but it certainly is in line with national polling and Trump’s troubles in states he won easily in 2016. Nationally, Biden is ahead by 8.6% in the FiveThirtyEight polling average . Trump leading Biden by just 7 points in Utah is closer than the polling averages in other reliably Republican states like Alaska (Trump +7.9%), Idaho (Trump +19.9%), Indiana (Trump +9.1%), Kansas (Trump +10.3%) and Mississippi (Trump +16.1%).
Neighboring Arizona has become one of the hottest battleground states. Both Trump and Biden have been campaigning hard for the state’s 11 electoral votes.
Y2′s survey found Biden with a small lead over Trump there 50% to 47%. That’s in line with the FiveThirtyEight.com average that has Biden ahead 3.1 percentage points in Arizona. And 48% of voters in Arizona said they were “definitely” planning on voting for Biden, while 45% said the same for Trump. Just 1% of Biden voters and 2% of Trump voters said they might change their minds.
LDS voters
Trump leads Biden among LDS voters in Arizona by a 76% to 18% margin, but that’s not necessarily bad news for the Democratic nominee. Trump’s support from Latter-day Saints is essentially unchanged from 2016, according to the Y2 survey, but the percentage of members who back Biden has doubled from four years ago when just 9% said they voted for Hillary Clinton.
That jump in LDS support for Biden could be a critical factor in Tuesday’s election. Trump carried Arizona by 3.5%, with 48% of the vote in 2016 . That’s nearly the same as the 47% he gets in this current survey, but Biden is more than 6-points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s 44.5% from four years ago.
LDS voters in Utah are much less enthusiastic about Trump than their counterparts in Arizona when you look at the two surveys. Trump’s support among LDS voters in Utah is running about 11 points behind his numbers in Arizona, with 65% of Latter-day Saints in Utah backing Trump. That support increases to 68% in Utah among self-identified “very active” members.
“Evan McMullin did not qualify for the ballot in Arizona in 2016,” said Monson, which he believes is a significant factor in Trump’s tepid support among Utah’s Latter-day Saints.
“He wasn’t an option for LDS voters in Arizona four years ago, so you see those voters returning to Trump there in the same numbers," he said. "But in Utah, McMullin pulled a significant number of those voters in 2016, and many of them are still reluctant to get behind Trump. I wonder if McMullin had made it on the ballot in Arizona you’d see a difference.”
Utah’s race for governor
Back in Utah, the Y2 survey finds Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox polling better than Trump, as he leads Democrat Chris Peterson in the gubernatorial race 58% to 33%. That’s virtually identical to Y2′s survey from the beginning of October when Cox led Peterson 57% to 33%.
Cox enjoys bipartisan support in his bid to succeed Gov. Gary Herbert, with 82% of Republicans, 14% of Democrats and 42% of unaffiliated voters backing the front-runner. Peterson draws support from 83% of Democrats and 46% of unaffiliated voters. Those numbers would need to be much higher for him to pull the unlikely upset. Y2 had polled for Cox in the primary election, but the firm says it is not working for any Utah federal or statewide candidate during the general election
Y2′s survey of the Arizona Senate race found Democratic challenger Mark Kelly leading Republican Sen. Martha McSally by 4 points, 51% to 47%. Democrats are hoping to flip control of this seat as part of their bid to gain control of the upper chamber in Congress. Lee was in Arizona campaigning for McSally this weekend.
Y2 polled 660 likely voters in Utah and 700 likely voters in Arizona from Oct. 15 to 24, using a mix of online surveys and phone calls. The margin of error in the Utah survey is 3.8 percentage points while Arizona’s is 3.7 percentage points.""" ;

Secretary of State Steve Simon today convened the State Canvassing Board to review the canvass report for the 2020 General Election and certify the results. In addition to the U.S. Presidential election and a U.S. Senate race, the board certified the election results of eight U.S. House of Representatives contests and state legislative and judicial offices.
“The State Canvassing Board has today certified Minnesota's 2020 General Election results,” said Secretary Steve Simon. “I’m proud to officially announce that for the third election in a row, Minnesota voters were number one in the nation in voter turnout.” The total number of voters was 3,292,997. That means 79.96 percent of eligible Minnesotans participated in the 2020 General Election. That is the highest percentage turnout since 1956, and the highest total number of voters ever.
“This election was like no other in Minnesota history. The pandemic meant administering the 2020 election using a public health and safety lens.” Secretary Simon said. “I made an unprecedented request of Minnesota voters: to consider voting from home with an absentee ballot. Those voters responded in truly remarkable fashion.” 1,906,383 million voters cast an absentee ballot - about 58 percent of those voting. The previous highest level, in 2018, was around 24 percent.
The election was a great success for other reasons. There was no lack of election judges, which other states faced. There was no report of violence or intimidation, as some had feared. There were no credible allegations of voter fraud. And there was no shortage of PPE or supplies at polling places to keep in-person voters safe.
“Even as we celebrate a third consecutive election leading the nation in turnout, I know that Minnesota can do more to make every voice heard. No matter where they live in Minnesota, or what language they speak, or what accommodations they need to cast their ballot, I look forward to continuing my mission to make it as easy as possible for every eligible Minnesotan to vote.”
The State Canvassing Board is called pursuant to Article VII, Section 8 of the Constitution of the State of Minnesota, which states: The returns of every election for officeholders elected statewide shall be made to the secretary of state who shall call to his assistance two or more of the judges of the supreme court and two disinterested judges of the district courts. They shall constitute a board of canvassers to canvass the returns and declare the result within three days after the canvass.
Secretary of State Simon extended his thanks to the Justices and Judges who agreed to serve on this canvassing board to certify the election results: Margaret H. Chutich, Associate Justice, Minnesota Supreme Court; Gordon L. Moore III, Associate Justice, Minnesota Supreme Court; Regina Chu, Judge, Fourth Judicial District Court; and Christian Sande, Judge, Fourth Judicial District Court.""" ;

“Do not mistake yourselves for one minute, the enemy sees all posted on this website. I do not want to discourage the last hope for the best, but you must realize the power of the lone wolf, is the power that come forth in ALL situations,” Houser wrote on aforum dedicated to the New York chapter of Golden Dawn, Greece’s far-right neo-Nazi political party. “Look within yourselves.”
That comment was one of dozens of messages that Houser, 59, left on several Internet message boards, all of which provide a picture of a politically disaffected, angry man who viewed the United States as a “financially failing filth farm,” expressed interest in white power groups, anti-Semitic ideas, the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church, as well as a number of conspiracy theories often espoused by the antigovernment right.
But his extremism appears to have gone deeper. In 2005, he registered to attend David Duke’s European-American Unity and Rights Organization(EURO) Conference in New Orleans, according to a spreadsheet of conference registrations obtained by Hatewatch. He lauded Duke, one of the most recognizable figures of the American radical right, a neo-Nazi, longtime Ku Klux Klan leader and now an international spokesman for Holocaust denial. On a PoliticalForum.com, Houser wrote in 2013, “David Duke has been unseen or hear of in years, but at one time appeared exactly what US needed.”
David Duke (pictured) organized European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) which claims to fight for “White Civil Rights” for “European and Americans Wherever They May Live.
Elsewhere online, Houser described his interests as “hustling” and said that his political involvement was minimal, though he belonged to a forum associated with Tea Party Nation. He sang the praise of Adolf Hitler many times, saying “Hitler is loved for the results of his pragmatism,” last January on the website stateofmind13.com.
Aside from his affinity for Hitler and Golden Dawn, he expressed racist extremism elsewhere. He promoted the disproven racist theory that a connection exists between race and IQ, and promoted The Bell Curve, a book written by Charles Murray. As for voting, he said, “don’t vote, waste of time.”
The shooting comes five weeks after Dylann Roof walked into a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., and killed nine people, adding to an ever growing list of attackers who, motivated by right-wing ideologies, have a left a growing body count of innocent victims.
Earlier this year, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report that found lone wolf terrorists were among the most violent threat emerging form the radical right. The study found that in the last five years, an attack from a lone wolf was carried out or thwarted on average every 34 days and that the overwhelming majority of those attacks, 74 percent, were carried out by a single person — 90 percent were carried out by a group of no more than two people.
Last year, the SPLC released a report,White Homicide Worldwide, about Stormfront, which is the largest hate site on the Web. The report pointed out that more than 100 people were killed by extremists active on the site in the prior five years. The report also noted that personal crises often precede extremist violence. According to CNN, Houser suffered just such a personal crisis, having been evicted from his home in March 2014. Those personal troubles also came as he praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
“It is a shame Tim McVeigh is not going to be with us to enjoy the hilarity of turning the tables with an IRON HAND,” Houser wrote on the Golden Dawn website.
Here is a sampling of Houser’s comments left across the Web:

The clerk’s office reported Tuesday evening that 35,873 people in the county cast ballots on the first day of early voting this year — more than 2,200 voters than what was reported on the first day of early voting in 2016.
The clerk’s office also reported it has received 22,577 mail-in ballots as of Tuesday. In 2016, the county received 11,020 mail-in ballots by the end of the first day of early voting.
The three early voting locations with the largest reported number of voters on Tuesday were the Austin Central Library with 1,434 voters, the Ben Hur Shrine Center with 1,365 voters, and Austin Oaks Church with 1,298 voters, according to the county clerk’s office.
8:15 p.m. update: More than an hour after lines for early voting were cut off on Tuesday, several voting locations showed seven locations with longer than 51-minute wait times, according to the Travis County clerk’s online wait time map.
The seven locations were: Austin Oaks Church, Bee Cave City Hall, Parque Zaragoza Recreation Center, Pflugerville ISD Rock Gym, Round Rock ISD Hartfield Performing Arts Center, Shady Hollow Village Shopping Center, and Westlake United Methodist.
Seven other locations, including the Dittmar Recreation Center which reported voting machine malfunctions Tuesday morning, had wait times of 21 minutes or more according to the county clerk’s office.
Travis County has a total of 37 early voting locations, according to the clerk’s office.
A spokeswoman from the Travis County clerk’s office told the American-Statesman that they had not received any reports of law enforcement being called to respond to incidents related to polling locations.
6:15 p.m. update: Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said 32,000 people had voted as of 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
As of 6 PM 32,000 people have voted in Travis County. One hour left to vote today! If you’re in line by 7 PM you are able to vote.
— Travis County Clerk (@TravisCoClerk) October 13, 2020
3:45 p.m. update: By 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, at least 24,000 people had voted in Travis County, according to Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir.
Tuesday’s mid-afternoon update outpaces the 2016 turnout. On the first day of early voting in the 2016 general election, 24,000 people had voted in Travis County by 4 p.m.
Officials earlier reported record-breaking voter registration numbers in Travis and Bastrop Counties.
Noon update: As of noon, 14,000 people voted in Travis County, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said.
She said the first day of early voting tends to be the busiest, but expects lines and wait times to thin out over the next few days.
"This is pretty normal behavior and I think by day two or three you will find that the lines are less daunting," DeBeauvoir said. "There is such high enthusiasm out there. Voters are in a good mood and are taking care of each other by wearing masks and social distancing. Everyone is just having a good time. So get out and vote."
Voters at Dittmar Recreation Center in South Austin reported voting machine malfunctions Tuesday morning that caused longer wait times than unusual.
DeBeauvoir said multiple technicians are deployed across the county to help resolve such issues, and to ensure machines are up and running. The malfunction at Dittmar Recreation Center has been resolved, she said.
"When this happens people, don’t stop voting," she said. "Voters can drop their ballot in the emergency ballot box, and that will still be tallied … technical issues might happen at any point, and when they do happen it's about when and how quickly can we get it resolved."
11:15 a.m. update: As lines wrapped around voting locations in Travis County Tuesday morning, Travis County Tax Assessor-Collector Bruce Elfant reported that nearly all eligible voters in Travis County were registered to vote this year.
Of the county’s more than 850,000 eligible voters, a record 97% of them are registered to vote in the Nov. 3 general election, Elfant said.
"This number even exceeds my expectations," Elfant said. "To everyone who registered to vote, thank you. To our civic army of volunteers who registered voters, thank you. To my voter registration staff, thank you."
He credited the turnout to the county’s contactless voter registration program, Text2Register, which was used by more than 4,700 county residents.
He also credited the University of Texas Athletics Department for public service announcements.
Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said the county has received 78,000 requests for mail-in ballots. Of those, 75,000 were sent to voter mailboxes and 14,400 have been returned, she said.
Mail-in ballots will not be tallied until 7 a.m. on Election Day, she said.
10:15 a.m. update: During the first three hours of early voting on Tuesday, more than 6,000 Travis County voters cast in-person ballots, said Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir.
Voters lined up at some of the county’s 37 voting locations overnight to be able to vote right as polls opened, DeBeauvoir said.
The large voter turnout has led to long lines and lengthy wait times. Most wait times at voting locations were 20 minutes or more as of 9:50 a.m., according to the Travis County Clerk website.
Voters at Ben Hur Shrine Center reported a three-hour wait time and another in Pflugerville said she was in line for several hours Tuesday morning.
At Shady Hollow Village Shopping Center in South Austin, voters were cheered on by those still waiting in line. Like marathon finishers, voters were praised with shouts of "You did it!" or "It was well worth it!" when they came out of the voting center.
A pregnant woman who had waited in line for three hours was told she had a story to tell her baby.
DeBeauvoir said she knows of threats on social media about people overtaking the polls.
"I'm pretty sure this is the same threat we've heard before and it never came to fruition. I don’t think it will this time either," she said.
Earlier: Minutes after polls opened for early voting in Travis County, voters reported long lines and wait times.
Voting booths opened at 7 a.m. and by 7:15 a.m., at least 11 of them had wait times of 20 minutes or more, according to the Travis County Clerk’s wait time map. Three more voting locations had a wait of 10 to 20 minutes.
Plenty of voting spots still had short waits at 7:15 a.m., including Austin Central Library, Austin Recreation Center and Dittmar Recreation Center.

The voting line at Shady Hollow Village Shopping Center, at the intersection of Brodie Lane and Slaughter Lane, snaked from the new polling place near JuiceLand on the north end of the shopping center to the Whataburger on the far south end.
The line continues to grow, voters said. Voters had on face masks and two women were passing out water and snacks to those in line.
Temperatures were a cool 58 degrees at 7:25 a.m., according to the National Weather Service.

The Travis County Clerk’s office said 38,119 voters cast ballots Wednesday, 2,246 more than what was reported on the first day of early voting.
By comparison, 33,582 people in Travis County cast their ballots on the second day of early voting for the 2016 elections — 4,537 less than what was reported Wednesday.
The surge of voters comes after 35,873 people cast in-person ballots Tuesday in the county — 2,200 voters more than the first day of early voting in 2016 and a single-day record for early voting in the county.
"This election is far bigger and far more intense than anything we’ve seen before," Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said.
Voters reported long lines throughout the day Tuesday. By mid-afternoon, the Travis County wait time map showed eight polling locations with a wait time of more than 50 minutes.
No polling place malfunctions or issues were reported in the county Wednesday.
A record 97% of Travis County’s eligible 850,000 voters are registered to vote in the Nov. 3 election. Statewide, 78% of eligible voters are registered. There are 1.8 million more registered voters in Texas than four years ago, keeping pace with the state’s booming population.
DeBeauvoir said nearly 9,000 voters have hand delivered mail-in ballots, a new option this year before Election Day. An order from Gov. Greg Abbott required Travis County to close three drop-off locations, leaving one open at 5501 Airport Blvd.
"There is this pent-up demand that (the voters) had for voting, and now voting day is finally here and they’re practically cheering in the streets," DeBeauvoir said.
As of 2 PM 22,000 people have voted in Travis County. Make your plan to #VoteEarly at https://t.co/StJCcmUUcR and keep it up!
— Travis County Clerk (@TravisCoClerk) October 14, 2020
The clerk’s office also reported it has received 22,577 mail-in ballots as of Tuesday. In 2016, the county received 11,020 mail-in ballots by the end of the first day of early voting.
DeBeauvoir said the county has received 79,387 requests for mail-in ballots, with 75,471 ballots already being mailed out.
It's too early to tell which party might benefit from a surge of early voters, but it's clear that there's a lot of enthusiasm this election, said former state Rep. Sherri Greenberg, a fellow at the University of Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs.
"What we’re seeing and what we expected is a dramatic early voting turnout in all the major metropolitan areas yesterday," she said. "Expectations are that that will continue."
The Texas secretary of state’s website reported more than 907,000 in-person and mail-in ballots cast across the state by Wednesday afternoon, a lagging number because many counties don’t immediately enter the data.

Harris County, the state’s most populous county, saw the most voters on Tuesday, with more than 128,000 in-person ballots cast. By 5 p.m. Wednesday, Harris County officials said more than 100,000 ballots had been cast. On the second day of early voting in that county in 2016, 73,542 people cast ballots.
In Central Texas, Williamson County reported more than 22,000 voters had cast ballots Tuesday, surpassing the roughly 18,000 ballots cast on the first day of early voting in 2016.
At 5:30 p.m., Williamson County’s website showed more than 19,000 ballots cast Wednesday.
Hays County saw nearly 6,900 ballots cast in person Tuesday, an increase of about 2,000 from 2016. County officials also reported a surge in the number of mail-in ballots, with more than 14,000 mail-in ballots received Tuesday.
Dallas County saw nearly 60,000 in-person voters Tuesday, more than 1,000 additional ballots than were cast on the first day of early voting in 2016.

<https://www.statesman.com/news/20201023/appeals-court-upholds-order-against-abbottrsquos-limit-on-ballot-drop-sites> dct:description """Ruling against Gov. Greg Abbott, a state appeals court Friday upheld a lower-court judge who said counties should be allowed to open multiple sites where voters can drop off completed mail-in ballots.
The fight will next shift to the Texas Supreme Court for a final decision in the waning days of the Nov. 3 election.
The issue is whether Abbott’s Oct. 1 order limiting counties to only one ballot drop-off location should stand.
The Anti-Defamation League and Common Cause Texas sued, arguing that Abbott did not have the authority to limit drop-off sites under state law or the Texas Constitution.
State District Judge Tim Sulak of Travis County agreed and issued a temporary injunction Oct. 15 that blocked Abbott’s order as an improper burden on voters’ rights.
"The limitation to a single drop-off location for mail ballots would likely needlessly and unreasonably increase risks of exposure to COVID-19 infections, and needlessly and unreasonably substantially burden potential voters’ constitutionally protected rights to vote, as a consequence of increased travel and delays, among other things," wrote Sulak, a Democrat.
Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed, leading to an expedited review by the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals — and a limited ruling Friday afternoon that upheld Sulak’s injunction.
The unsigned opinion by three justices on the 3rd Court — Democrats Chari Kelly and Edward Smith and Republican Melissa Goodwin — did not weigh the legality or constitutionality of Abbott’s order.
Instead, the panel determined that Sulak’s injunction should not be struck down because the judge did not abuse his discretion by issuing it.
"The trial court could have credited the evidence that decreasing the number of return locations leading up to election day would significantly increase congestion and wait times ... which in turn would increase the risk of the voters utilizing this method of contracting COVID-19," the panel said.
Paxton quickly appealed, and the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court issued an order Saturday that kept Abbott’s order in force until the court can rule on the appeal. The Supreme Court also gave a 5 p.m. Monday deadline for legal briefs to be filed in the case.
Abbott’s order forced Travis County to close three downtown drop-off sites, leaving open only the location at 5501 Airport Blvd. in Austin. Three other large counties also closed extra drop-off sites.
The challenge in state court is separate from a federal lawsuit that ended with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirming Abbott’s limit on drop-off sites.
The federal court rejected arguments that Abbott infringed on voting rights by making it harder to cast a ballot, particularly for older and disabled voters who are the most likely to use mail-in balloting.
Instead, the court ruled, Abbott merely tweaked an earlier order that suspended a state law allowing mail-in ballots to be hand delivered only on Election Day. In reality, Abbott had expanded options by giving voters 40 extra days to drop off their ballots, even if only at one location, the court said.""" ;

<https://www.telegram.com/news/20180609/65-years-ago-nightmare-tornado-killed-94-central-mass> dct:description """It happened 65 years ago, but many people in the area still look warily at the sky when it gets dark and the wind that marks the beginning of a thunderstorm rolls over their neighborhood.
Mary S. Morello, 92, remembers Tuesday, June 9, 1953, as the day the infamous Worcester tornado leveled the Curtis Apartments at Great Brook Valley where she lived with her husband, John, and their three children.
Mrs. Morello recalls huddling in a third-floor hallway of the apartment building as the storm ripped it apart.
“I remember looking up and seeing the sky,” she said.
Mrs. Morello estimates that the fury of the epic storm lasted about three minutes. “It was so horrifying that day,” she said. “It’s stayed with me ever since. I hope we don’t see another one like that come here.”
Thomas P. Grazulis, known by most in the weather world as the country’s foremost tornado historian, was 11 years old and living on Grafton Hill in Worcester when hail the size of tennis balls began pelting him.
And while that was happening his sister was taking in laundry from the family’s back porch on Shannon Street when she spotted a tornado funnel as it crossed the northern part of the city.
“The Worcester tornado is unique,” said Mr Grazulis who now lives in northeast Vermont with his wife Doris.
“It was a storm that compares with anything you would see in Oklahoma in a part of the country that doesn’t get tornadoes like that. It really is in a class by itself. That would be a billion dollar tornado today,” he said.
The tornado first touched down in Petersham about 4:25 p.m on a day when a warm front that had crossed Central Massachusetts earlier in the morning brought showers, followed by clearing that cooked the atmosphere into a roiling column of instability. That led to formation of an F-4 twister that pummeled Rutland, Holden, north Worcester, Shrewsbury, Westboro, and Southboro before retreating into the sky about an hour later.
The supercell thunderstorm that towered more than 70,000 feet into the sky also spawned a weaker tornado that touched down in Sutton. A mature thunderstorm usually reaches a height between 40,000 and 60,000 feet.
By then, 94 people - including 62 in Worcester - were killed and almost 1,300 injured during the storm that had winds estimated at more than 260 miles per hour. About 10,000 people were left homeless, at least temporarily.
“The Worcester tornado was not an accident, it was not a fluke,” said Channel 5 Chief Meteorologist Harvey Leonard in noting that atmospheric conditions - rare for this part of the country - were in place to change the lives of many people.
Forecasters in the Boston office of the United States Weather Bureau knew the atmosphere was primed for something extreme that day even though they didn’t have the information that today’s meteorologists use. At their late morning meeting, forecasters talked about the possibility of a tornado somewhere in their coverage area.
They decided against using the word "tornado" in their forecast because they didn’t want to scare people, but they issued the first severe thunderstorm watch ever for Massachusetts.
Events during the previous two days were also on forecasters' radar, which they had just discovered could be used to track tornadoes.
The cold front that helped form the Worcester County tornado had caused an F-4 tornado that killed 10 members of a family in Arcadia, Neb. on June 7. Then several tornadoes hit Central Michigan the next day including an F-5 that devastated Flint and Beecher. Those storms killed 115 people.
There is an axiom that Central New England frequently experiences the same weather 24 hours later than Michigan and that proved to be the case on June 9, 1953 .
Mr. Grazulis said "1953 was an absolutely unique year," noting that a tornado that May had killed more than 100 people in Waco, Tex.
“ Forecasters had some improved tools and there were some historic storms that year,” he said.
Glenn Field is warning coordination meteorologist in the Norton office of the National Weather Service. He said an atmospheric configuration today that could cause such a big tornado would be picked up by computers several days before. Plus, radar is now so advanced it would scan the tornado every minute giving forecasters the ability to update people in its path almost immediately.
There was no twitter back then to alert people and Mr. Field said that, along with NWS forecasters and television meteorologists, they would give residents the latest information as they did when an EF-3 twister carved a 39-mile path through Central and Western Massachusetts on June 1, 2011.
“We would be on the air as long as there is a tornado warning," Mr. Leonard said.
Michael E. Shanley, acting director of emergency communications for Worcester, said the city has a reverse 911 system that would alert people in the path of a storm. Weather radios that broadcast weather information have also been placed in all city schools and public buildings, Mr. Shanley and Mr. Field said.
Those are among the steps that have been taken by Worcester and Shrewsbury that have allowed the National Weather Service to deem them Storm Ready. There are only 18 Storm Ready communities in the state, Mr. Field said.
The rating of the 1953 storm on University of Chicago Professor Ted Fugita’s F scale has long been disputed among weather people. The National Weather Service, at the urging of the then-Taunton NWS office, commissioned a three-person study of the storm 10 years ago that kept the rating at F-4 even though there are photos of F-5 damage in some places along the path.
Mr. Grazulis said engineers looking at the damage could not determine how solid some of the construction was in the buildings that were along the 46-mile path.
Mr. Grazulis, along with Weather Channel Severe storm expert Greg Forbes, one member of the team that studied the storm 10 years ago, believe the storm was an F-5 when it struck Holden, the Burncoat-Greendale section of Worcester and Shrewsbury.
The storm was the impetus for better radar coverage and a nationwide network of severe storm spotters.
Edwin Kessler was a student at MIT that day and he eventually became the first director of the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman. Okla.
In an interview with the Telegram & Gazette 15 years ago, Mr. Kessler said it was impossible to overstate the significance of the June 9, 1953 tornado. He said it was one of the most significant events in the nation’s weather history.""" ;

<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557183/Middle-aged-rockers-dilute-Glastonbury-spirit.html> dct:description """For years fans have accused The Glastonbury Fesitval of being too middle-class. Now the organiser says it has become too middle-aged.
Michael Eavis said the decision to sell tickets online for this year’s three-day event had attracted an older crowd, at the expense of teenagers.
Despite being “fantastically well-mannered and polite” he fears that if mature fans dominate future festivals they will “change the nature of the show”.
In a bid to keep the youthful flavour, Mr Eavis has pledged to sell about 40 per cent of the tickets for Glastonbury 2008 via phone lines.
“We’re trying to get the youngsters back - the 16, 17 and 18-year-olds - because numbers were down this year,” Mr Eavis said. “People say we’re getting middle class, which is stretching it a bit far, but we’re attracting a lot more people in their 30s and 40s and need to get the Radio 1 and NME crowd back in.
“The people who now come have the right attitude, they grin and bear the mud. They’re fantastically well mannered and polite and respectable, but they do change the nature of the show. The demographic is changing and it’s slightly worrying. We might lose the fascination the show has for the public,” he added.
This year the mud-strewn event, in Pilton, Somerset, was noticeably short of 30,000 to 40,000 young people, Mr Eavis said.
Teenagers were less able to get their hands on tickets this year because the internet-only sales policy gave older people with access to fast internet connections an advantage, Mr Eavis said.
“By selling 40 per cent of tickets through phone lines, kids will be able to use their mobile phones to get tickets.”
Iain Gray, The Telegraph’s online music editor said this year’s event was very middle-class.
Fans discussing the festival on internet message boards thought the new system might also attract more “genuine hippies”.
One, calling himself Fanzine, wrote: “You can’t expect real hippies to set their alarm for 9am on a Sunday morning and start feverishly hitting refresh on their web browser.”
This year the 137,500 tickets were snapped up in a record time of one hour 45 minutes.""" ;

He told The People : "Derrick's been a single guy since I've known him and he did what any other single guy would do in the spare time out there.
"He chatted to girls in the bar, bought them drinks, took a couple back to the hotel, nothing outrageous or out of the ordinary.
"None of the other lads minded, a couple of us have partners and have children so we left him to it most nights, but his behaviour certainly didn't offend me in any way.
"Hon looked about 19 but I think she was about 30 at the time.
"We would drink in The Kennel Bar in Soi Pattaya nearly every night as we knew the owner of the place and most of the people there, it was like a home from home.
"I knew Derrick liked the lass so I told him to go for it, he had nothing to lose."
Mr Kennedy, a father-of-seven who describes himself as one of Bird's best friends but now needs a hand amputation, said Bird wooed Hon with drinks and gifts.
Over the next three years he is said to have kept in touch with her through texts and letters.
Another friend said Bird had sent £1,000 to Hon earlier this year, but afterwards before she dumped him via text message.
The friend added: "Derrick said he'd been made a fool out of, he couldn't believe it. He had a lot of problems in his life, money worries and a fallout with his family and he said the fact that he had this woman in Thailand and had someone to go to see out there gave him reason to be hopeful.\"""" ;

"Her friend literally jumped over her and, by her account, actually saved her life," he said.
Amy Schumer, who wrote and starred in the film, took to Twitter to express her horror.
My heart is broken and all my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Louisiana. — Amy Schumer (@amyschumer) July 24, 2015
The attack took place almost three years to the day after 12 people were killed at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado, and follows a string of multiple shootings in recent weeks.
Much of America remains resistant to tougher gun control. In 2013, Barack Obama failed to steer legislation - introduced after the murder of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut – through Congress.
In an interview with the BBC, conducted before the latest shootings, he promised to continue working on the issue.
“That is an area where if you ask me where has been the one area where I feel that I've been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws,” he said. “Even in the face of repeated mass killings.”
He pointed out that the number of Americans killed by terrorism since 9/11 was fewer than 100, while the number killed by gun violence was in the tens of thousands.
“And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing,” he said. “But it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months.”
Meanwhile, the killings continue.
Last month, a gunman shot dead nine worshippers at a historic church in Charleston and last week four Marines and a Navy sailor were killied in Chattanooga.
On Friday, police in Lafayette said House fired at least 13 rounds from his handgun inside the cinema.
They named his victims as Jillian Johnson, 33, and Mayci Breaux, 21.
Jim Craft, the local police chief, said the gunman had been staying at a local motel, where officers found a collection of glasses and wigs, and had switched the license plate on his car.
“It is apparent that he was intent on shooting and then escaping,” he said.
“What happened is that the quick law enforcement response forced him back into the theatre, at which time he shot himself.”

<https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/dallas-courthouse-shooter-brian-clyde-radicalized/> dct:description """On Monday morning, Brian Clyde, a 22-year-old who served two years in the Army, stalked outside of the Earl Cabell Federal Building in a black mask and body armor, a long knife, and a semiautomatic rifle with an array of high-capacity magazines. After firing shots at the facade of the building, Clyde was killed by federal agents. No one else was hurt.
Clyde’s social media presence was similar to that of a number of mass shooters. He shared memes that contained references to “incels,” a subculture of men who declare themselves “involuntarily celibate” and who have proven themselves capable of mass violence in places like Isla Vista, California, Toronto, and Parkland, Florida. He referenced Alex Jones and “Hollywood pedophiles,” attacked Hillary Clinton, and was comfortable with swastikas and Confederate flags. A week before he went to the federal courthouse, he posted a video declaring “the storm is coming,” a phrase popular among the QAnon conspiracy theorists. He referenced the sort of memes that were popular on sites like 4chan, where users employ nihilistic humor and obscure references—a body pillow featuring anime characters, for example, is a reference that “normies” who live outside of the subculture are unlikely to pick up.
In other words, Clyde was immersed in the same sort of radicalized online culture as a lot of other mass shooters. The question is how he got there.
Normally in situations like this, we refrain from talking much about the shooter. Doing so, research suggests, can inspire copycats who imagine seeing their own names make headlines for mass murder. It feels disrespectful to the victims of the gunman to expend too much empathy on their attacker. Who, in the end, gets to be “a nice kid from a great family” in these situations?
But Clyde’s situation is different. He didn’t shoot anyone else, and there’s no glory in emulating someone who failed in their objective, if Clyde did indeed go to the courthouse looking to kill. Because the only person who died at the courthouse on Monday was Clyde, we can spare a moment to consider how the online swamps he swam in may have lead to his death.
There’s no clear trail when it comes to Clyde. Unlike a number of shooters, he didn’t pen a lengthy manifesto before he left home for the final time. If he posted on the anonymous 4chan message boards—which, based on the memes he enjoyed, seems possible—no one has yet connected the activity there to his real-world identity. But we do know, in a broad sense, how the culture that Clyde identified with radicalizes young, mostly white men into storming a public space with a weapon.
The online culture that Clyde found himself posting memes from is constructed to appeal to people who feel isolated, alienated, and depressed. The incel subculture is built specifically around the idea that some men are too undesirable to fit with society, and it encourages men who identify with the group to take their frustration out on women. The Isla Vista shooter, who described himself as a “supreme gentleman” in videos before his attack, is a meme among the group, referenced with the same are-they-serious tone by both trolls at home and people who are about to commit mass murder. None of it, the incel doctrine says, is worth taking seriously. Instead, incels urge one another to get a “high score” with the veneer of irony that says that nothing matters—not their own lives, not the lives of others, not even actually going through with an attack. It’s not the dark seduction of someone being urged to commit violence in the name of a cause so much as it’s the constant one-upping of a dare, where men who were drawn to the community out of a sense of worthlessness challenge each other to prove otherwise, never really expecting that they will.
Trolling online is as old as the internet. Intentionally provoking people is nothing new, but the version we see today exists, in large part, to spread radical messages behind a veer of sarcasm. A person can troll by posting racist memes, anti-feminist propaganda, hate speech, or calls for violence, all with a practiced insincerity that says, “I don’t mean it,” even if the poster doesn’t not mean it, either. That ironic gray space is where the memes that Clyde posted online live. The Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter from March was part of that world; the screed from the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, shooter drew heavily from it. And, increasingly, young men like Clyde are courted by members of that culture for recruitment.
In May, an anonymous author published a story in The Washingtonian called “What Happened After My 13-Year-Old Son Joined the Alt-Right.” In the piece, the author details how her son was recruited: A zero-tolerance policy at his school led to him being pulled out of school and losing his friends for what she characterizes as a misunderstanding of an inside joke. He spent more time online, interacting with people on 4chan and Reddit who insisted that what happened to him was part of a pattern of women lying, governments oppressing people like him, and a wider world of racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic conspiracies. When left to research these claims online, he was guided by Google’s algorithms to arguments that confirmed what he had been told.
In addition to active recruitment, that algorithmic radicalization happens frequently. It doesn’t take too many “up next” jumps to be pushed from watching video game walkthroughs on YouTube to consuming content declaring that feminists want to destroy families. Earlier this month, the New York Times chronicled the role YouTube plays in steering young men toward content of that nature, which has a higher rate of retention among viewers than less incendiary videos. The more you watch, the more YouTube recommends, creating an information bubble that further steers viewers toward online communities full of talk about “Chads” and “Stacys,” anti-Semitism, and white nationalism.
Brian Clyde’s family doesn’t know how he ended up radicalized, masked, and armed, firing shots at a federal courthouse before his death. We do know that in 2016, Clyde’s half-brother called the FBI to warn that Clyde was “suicidal and had a fascination with guns.” In the lead-up to the shooting, Clyde posted incel memes about a “Chad rampage” and a “virgin shooting,” but despite his mental health history and the infatuation with toxic online culture, the family says they didn’t see it coming. In a statement released shortly after the shooting, they said, “We don’t understand any more than anyone else why he chose to do what he did, but we are very thankful that there was no other loss of life.” Later, his father told the Dallas Morning News that he returned to the site of the 2016 ambush that killed several police officers with the intention of committing “suicide by cop.” He believed that it was never his son’s intention to kill anyone. “My son was a very good shot,” he told the paper. “He didn’t have an intention to shoot anybody.”
Perhaps this is a grieving father just trying to make sense of an unspeakable tragedy. He may have gone out with the intention of being killed by dressing as a killer; he may have gone with the intention of hurting people before finding that, in the moment, he couldn’t bring himself to do it; he may have just missed his shots. He’s dead, and we’ll never know. But the link between the online world he was drawn to and the scenario in which he died is a clear one, and since there was only one body on the ground at the courthouse, it’s worth talking about how people who get sucked into a hateful vortex that tells them that their lives are only valuable if they go out bringing death are victims of a nihilistic online culture, too.""" ;

<https://www.texasobserver.org/young-voters-texas-2020/> dct:description """By the end of early voting, 1 million voters under the age of 30 had cast their ballot. Will they turn Texas blue?
A little more than a month before early voting started in Texas, a group of 20-somethings and teenagers with the Sunrise Movement drove to Congressman Michael McCaul’s home in an Austin suburb. It was 5 a.m., and the climate activists from a district that stretches from Austin all the way to Katy wanted to send their Republican representative a message: They would do everything they could to replace him with Mike Siegel, a Democrat who has promised to back the Green New Deal and who came within 5 points of winning the district in 2018.
In the weeks that followed, Sunrise activists from across the country—alongside the Texas Democratic party and former presidential candidate Julian Castro—made hundreds of thousands of calls for Mike Siegel and Julie Oliver, another Green New Deal candidate running in an Austin district.
Some of the volunteers who helped Sunrise call hundreds of thousands of voters in just a few days aren’t old enough to vote themselves, says Rachele Merliss, a 23-year-old organizer with the Austin chapter. “[Young people] feel the urgency of the climate crisis in the way that older people don’t,” she says. That urgency makes them some of the most effective phone bankers for Green New Deal candidates. It’s also led to at least one viral TikTok featuring progressive Texas candidates, as the group of young activists works to turn out young voters in Texas. “A lot of politics can be dark and stressful,” Merliss says. Look no further than the raging pandemic, the ongoing protests around police brutality, or the wildfires and hurricanes that have battered the West Coast and Gulf Coast. Sunrise’s “massive army of young people,” as Merliss calls them, is one of this year’s political bright spots.
It’s not just Sunrise: Young people all over Texas are more politically engaged than ever. By the end of early voting, more than 1.3 million voters under the age of 30 had cast their ballot—surpassing the total votes cast by young people in 2016. Young voters doubled their share of the early vote total, from 6 percent in 2016 to 13 percent this year. Progressive organizers and Democratic strategists have been using every tool in the proverbial box to turn out young voters, who have historically had abysmally low turnout rates. In 2014, for example, only 8 percent of voters under 30 participated in the election; in 2018, when Beto O’Rourke tried to flip Ted Cruz’s senate seat, turnout rose to 25 percent.
Texas has one of the largest populations of young people in the nation: The median age of a Texan is 34, about three years younger than the national median. Millennial and Gen Z Texans are also more diverse than their national cohort. Nearly two-thirds are nonwhite, according to data from the State Comptroller. In previous elections, young Texans overwhelmingly favored Democrats, and their turnout this year could flip races up and down the ballot.
“I think young people in Texas are tired of what’s happening and the leadership we’re seeing.”
This political momentum “has been brewing for a long time,” says Jacob Caynon, the Gen Z and Millennial organizer for Texas Democrats. He was in high school during the 2016 election and 2018 Parkland shooting and says he remembers feeling hopeless. “I think young people in Texas are tired of what’s happening and the leadership we’re seeing.”
Texas’ voter registration laws haven’t been particularly friendly towards young voters, particularly young voters of color. For example, Texas is one of the handful of states where a student ID isn’t valid at the polls. And in 2018, students at Prairie View A&M, a historically Black college in a majority Black city, sued their county officials after the campus was denied an early voting site; during the March primaries, voters at Texas Southern, another HBCU in Houston, waited in line for hours and the final vote was cast after 1 a.m. Large college campuses like University of Texas at Austin have been gerrymandered so that the student voting bloc is split into two congressional districts—the 25th district, where Oliver is running to unseat Roger Williams, who’s been in office since 2013, and the 21st, where Democrat Wendy Davis is in a competitive race against Republican Chip Roy.
The list continues: Texas is one of 11 states that doesn’t have an online voter registration system. Voters have to print out and mail in a form to register—a subtle hurdle for younger voters, says Kia Kolderup-Lane, the head of public policy and strategic initiatives at Big Tent Creative, a digital organizing firm.
“Many people in Gen Z have never mailed a package before, or [had to] buy stamps,” she says. “Many don’t have access to printers in their homes, or they are using their phones for everything,” she says. The firm partnered with influencers like San Antonio-based Paradiisedd to direct viewers to Bigtent’s voter registration website, where they could request a pre-filled registration form, complete with a stamp and an envelope.
Nationwide, Bigtent’s campaign registered 25,000 voters, the majority of whom were under 25; a fifth were in Texas. After voter registration closed, TikTokers continued to emphasize the importance of showing up at the polls, showing off their “I Voted” stickers or the outfits they wore to the polls, in an attempt to cultivate a healthy dose of FOMO among their peers.
While digital organizing on TikTok is a novel idea, it isn’t replacing traditional, grassroots organizing that targets young voters. In Austin, volunteers with Texas College Democrats dropped off 14,000 voter registration forms across West Campus once students arrived back on campus, says the chapter president, Joe Cascino. Across the state, organizers have been on the ground for months registering voters, block-walking, and text or phone banking. “We have been preparing for this for the past four years,” says Antonio Arellano, the interim director of Jolt, a progressive Latinx political advocacy group. “Before 2016, there was a massive void in Texas politics when it came to harnessing the power of young Latino voters.” According to a report from the organization, 46 percent of Latinos in Texas are voting-age citizens—but only 15 percent of the state’s Latino population voted in the 2016 presidential election.
This election cycle, Jolt invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in mobilizing voters in the Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio areas through social media, text and phone banks, and door-to-door canvassing. Jolt’s goal is to reach 75,000 homes in majority-Latino neighborhoods before election day. “We hear folks say, ‘You’re the first organization to knock on my door,’ or ‘No one block walks in this part of town,’” Arellano says. In 2016, Texas’ Latino voters of all ages favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 27 points. After four years of the Trump administration, Arellano says there’s a lot more on the line this year, pointing to specific policy issues that young people are engaged on: ending family separation at the border, for example, or increasing access to health insurance so that Latinos are not disproportionately uninsured in Texas.
But even if Joe Biden wins the Oval Office, organizers know that the fight isn’t over: They will still have to mobilize and engage new, young voters to push for proggressive policies like the Green New Deal or Medicare for All. “Gen Zers and Millennials are coming to terms with the future that they are going to inherit is one of chaos. They have to take control of it now to have a sustainable future,” Arellanos says.
“Texas is the solution,” he says. “This state can usher in an era of opportunity and prosperity with its 38 electoral votes.”

<https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/25/donald-trump-joe-biden-texas-polling/> dct:description """Donald Trump would beat Joe Biden by five points in Texas if the presidential race were held now, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.
In a Trump-Biden contest, Democratic and Republican voters overwhelmingly back their own party’s candidate. But independent voters are on the fence, with 39% favoring Trump, 29% favoring Biden and 32% saying they haven’t formed an opinion.
The five point difference in support — 44% for Biden, 49% for Trump — is in line with previous UT/TT Polls taken before Democrats had settled on a nominee. In November 2019, the president was 7 percentage points ahead of Biden in a hypothetical general election matchup. In the February survey — conducted shortly before the presidential primaries in Texas and before the coronavirus outbreak was widespread — the two candidates were 4 percentage points apart. In all three of the most recent surveys, Trump’s lead was small, but outside the margins of error; none of the results could be called a statistical tie.
Trump has a harder race against himself. Ask Texans whether they would vote today to re-elect the president and, as they have done in four previous UT/TT polls, they split down the middle: 50% say they would vote for him, 49% said they’d vote against him.
Among Republican voters, 81% say they would definitely vote for Trump, and another 11% say they probably would. Democratic voters are just the opposite, with 85% definitely planning to vote for someone else, and 9% probably planning to. Most independent voters — 61% — would vote for someone else, while 39% say they’d vote for the president.
It’s only when you add Biden to the mix that Trump pulls ahead. “When you put a flesh-and-blood opponent against them, they do better,” said Daron Shaw, co-director of the poll and a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
This year might make that usual head-to-head comparison more difficult, Shaw said.
“The reality nationally is that, for the first time in a long time, the incumbent isn’t going to be able to make it a comparison,” he said. “It’s going to be a referendum election about how the president is doing. First of all, it’s Trump, Trump, Trump all the time. And all the news is about coronavirus.”
And Texas voters give Trump approving grades on his response to the pandemic. While 48% approve, 45% disapprove. The first group includes 86% of Republicans, and the second includes 84% of Democrats.
Trump’s handling of the economy got similar marks: 49% of the state’s registered voters, including 89% of Republicans, approve of his economic policy. Another 42% — a group that includes 82% of Democrats — disapprove.
In a slight shift from the February UT/TT Poll, Texas voters were more likely to say Trump is doing a good job. Overall, 49% say they approve strongly (36%) or somewhat (13%) of the job he’s doing, while 45% say they disapprove, including 39% who disapprove strongly. In the February survey, 45% of voters gave the president a good report card while 48% gave him a bad one.
The partisans barely overlap on Trump’s performance, with 90% of Republicans saying they approve of the job he’s doing, and 87% of Democrats saying they disapprove.
Asked their opinion of the president’s Democratic rival, only 35% of the voters say they have a favorable impression of Biden, while 51% have an unfavorable one — including 40% who say their impression of the former vice president is “very unfavorable.”
Female voters are split 46-46 on the presidential race, while male voters are solidly with Trump at 53-41.
Trump maintains strong support with white voters in Texas, polling at 60-34 against Biden. But the story for black and Hispanic voters is more mixed: black voters are overwhelmingly in favor of Biden (74-16), while Hispanic voters showed a 50-40 preference.
Other differences show up in geography. 57% of urban voters prefer Biden, but Trump leads in both the suburbs at 49-43, and with rural voters — 67% of whom say they’d favor the Republican.
Yet, only 39% of Texas voters think the country is headed in the right direction, while 52% think things are on the wrong track. A strong majority of Republicans — 69% — say the U.S. is on the right track, while 86% of Democrats say it’s going in the wrong direction. Independents leaned toward the Democrats on the question: 60% say the country is going in the wrong direction.
The University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from April 10 to April 19 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. Numbers in charts might not add up to 100% because of rounding.

Gov. Greg Abbott threw the weight of his office Thursday behind Republican efforts to limit options for Texas voters who want to hand-deliver their completed absentee ballots for the November election — a rebuke to some large, Democratic counties that have set up multiple drop-off locations in what they call an effort to maximize voter convenience.
The Republican governor issued a proclamation directing counties to designate just one location for ballot drop-offs, and allowing political parties to install poll watchers to observe the process.
An unprecedented number of absentee ballots are expected to be cast this year as voters who qualify under Texas’ unusually strict vote-by-mail rules opt to avoid the health risks of voting in person. Republican officials have aggressively fought Democratic efforts to expand access to mail-in ballots during the pandemic.
President Donald Trump and many Republicans have sowed misinformation and confusion about the integrity of mail-in voting, which experts say is safe. With the U.S. Postal Service warning of potential delays, many Texans are eager to deliver their completed absentee ballots in person.

Harris County, the state’s most populous and a major Democratic stronghold, had designated a dozen locations where voters could deliver their own ballots — and already began collecting them this week. The locations are spread out across the county’s roughly 1,700 square miles, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.
In Travis County, also a major Democratic stronghold, officials had designated four locations where voters could deliver their ballots.
“This is a deliberate attempt to manipulate the election,” Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said Thursday at a press conference outside one of the county’s drop-off locations. Travis County officials say they plan to fight the order.
Lina Hidalgo, the Democratic Harris County judge, said “this isn’t security, it’s suppression.”
Harris County is bigger than the state of Rhode Island, and we're supposed to have 1 site? This isn't security, it's suppression. Mail ballot voters shouldn't have to drive 30 miles to drop off their ballot, or rely on a mail system that’s facing cutbacks. https://t.co/IeKwzdB0Hb — Lina Hidalgo (@LinaHidalgoTX) October 1, 2020 This tweet may have been deleted or made private.
And Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins said “to force hundreds of thousands of seniors and voters with disabilities to use a single drop-off location in a county that stretches over nearly 2,000 square miles is prejudicial and dangerous.”
Democratic groups are weighing filing a lawsuit as soon as Friday challenging Abbott’s order, according to one party source who was not authorized to speak on the record.
The ballot drop-off locations are staffed, and voters must present an approved form of identification to deliver their ballots. They may not turn in ballots for other voters.
Voting rights advocates say Abbott’s move will make absentee balloting more difficult in a year when more Texans than ever are expected to vote by mail. Drop-off locations, advocates said, are particularly important given concerns about Postal Service delays, especially for disabled voters or those without access to reliable transportation.
“It raises a real concern that people are going to have just one more barrier to successfully submitting their ballot,” barriers that will disproportionately hurt voters of color and those with disabilities, said Mimi Marziani, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which advocates for voting rights among other issues. “And it opens the door to voter intimidation.”
Texas has extended the early voting period by six days and is allowing voters to drop off absentee ballots before Election Day, but has done little else to give voters more options for safely casting ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Other states have allowed for universal absentee voting or even set up drop-off boxes where voters can deliver their ballots.
Abbott described his proclamation as an effort to “strengthen ballot security protocols throughout the state.” A spokesperson did not respond to questions about how allowing multiple drop-off locations might lead to fraud.
There is “not a shred of evidence,” Marziani said, that it would.
Abbott also announced that election clerks may collect absentee ballots only if they also permit poll watchers to observe the delivery of those ballots, “including the presentation of an acceptable form of identification.”
Nationally, the Republican Party is ramping up a multimillion-dollar effort to recruit poll watchers this year, the first presidential election in almost 40 years that the Republican National Committee has not been under a federal court order imposed to rein in the party’s “ballot security” efforts, which have a history of trying to intimidate voters of color.
In Texas, poll watchers are selected by candidates, political parties, or proponents or opponents of ballot measures — that is, people who have a stake in the outcome of the election. They must stand as silent sentinels and are not permitted to speak to voters or be inside voting booths.
But they, like voters themselves, are not required to wear masks to polling places this year, an exemption from the governor’s statewide mask order.
“These enhanced security protocols will ensure greater transparency and will help stop attempts at illegal voting,” Abbott said.
While there are documented cases of voter fraud in Texas, they are rare, and experts say absentee ballots are a secure way to vote this year.
The Texas Democratic Party slammed Abbott’s move.
“Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Governor Abbott is trying to adjust the rules last minute,” Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. “We are creating a movement that will beat them at the ballot box on November 3, and there’s nothing these cheaters can do about it.”
Wesley Story, spokesperson for the liberal group Progress Texas, called the proclamation “a blatant attempt to suppress voters.”
Harris County has already begun collecting absentee ballots at a number of locations across the sprawling county. Abbott said that ballots collected before Oct. 2 remain valid, subject to earlier rules. In July, Abbott gave voters more time to deliver their absentee ballots in person, an option typically available only on Election Day.
Texas has maintained its unusually strict criteria for absentee ballots during the pandemic. Voters qualify only if they are 65 or older, are confined in jail but otherwise eligible, are outside of their county through the election period, or cite a disability or illness. The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that lack of immunity to the coronavirus does not itself constitute disability, but that voters must consider that alongside their own personal medical history to decide whether they are eligible. Election administrators do not have the power to vet a voter’s disability claims or demand documentation, but providing false information is a crime.
The question of absentee ballot delivery in Harris County is already being disputed in a legal challenge filed by Houston Republicans earlier this week. A group of candidates and officials including the Harris County GOP has asked the Texas Supreme Court to limit the locations where voters can drop off their ballots, as well as to shorten the early voting period Abbott has laid out. That case is pending before the court.
On Wednesday, the day before the governor’s proclamation, Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins weighed in at the request of the court and backed Harris County’s efforts as lawful under the governor’s earlier orders.
Nothing in the law says that multiple drop-off locations cannot be used, Hawkins argued, and “accordingly, the Secretary of State has advised local officials that the Legislature has permitted ballots to be returned to any early-voting clerk office.”
Early voting is set to begin Oct. 13.

In whatâ€™s expected to be the final ruling on the matter, the Texas Supreme Court has upheld Gov. Greg Abbottâ€™s order limiting Texas counties to only one drop-off location for voters to hand deliver their absentee ballots during the pandemic.
The ruling, issued Tuesday by the all-Republican court, is the final outcome in one of a handful of lawsuits in state and federal courts that challenged Abbottâ€™s order from early this month. A federal appeals court also sided with the Republican governor in an earlier ruling, overturning a lower courtâ€™s decision.
The state lawsuit argued that the governor doesnâ€™t have authority under state law to limit absentee ballot hand-delivery locations, and that his order violates votersâ€™ equal protection rights under the state constitution. The suit was filed in Travis County by a Texas-based Anti-Defamation League, a voting rights advocacy group and a voter.

In their opinion, the justices wrote that Abbott's order "provides Texas voters more ways to vote in the November 3 election than does the Election Code. It does not disenfranchise anyone."
A Travis County state district judge had sided with the plaintiffs pushing to allow multiple drop-off sites, and an intermediate appeals court upheld that ruling Friday. No additional sites had been allowed to open during the appeals process, however.
As the coronavirus continued to endanger Texans, counties â€” often more populous, largely Democratic ones â€” began to look for ways to expand voting access in the fall election. Republicans have repeatedly challenged such expansions, like loosening Texasâ€™ strict restrictions on who can vote by mail or allowing for drive-thru voting, in court. The Texas Supreme Court has kept Texasâ€™ limitations on mail-in voting but allowed drive-thru voting in Harris County to continue.
Abbott issued an emergency order in July that lengthened the early voting period and extended the time voters have to deliver completed absentee ballots in person to county clerk offices. In typical elections, Texas voters who wish to deliver their absentee ballots in person can only do so on Election Day. That order, too, was unsuccessfully challenged by some Republicans, but ultimately Abbott rolled back his expansion for hand delivery of absentee ballots.
After Harris and Travis counties opened 12 and four drop-off sites at county clerk offices, respectively, the governor issued a new order Oct. 1 allowing counties just one drop-off location each. Abbott and Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs said the limiting order was enacted after Hughs learned that at least one county planned to accept hand-delivered absentee ballot applications at invalid county offices. The state also wanted poll watchers at each site accepting such ballots.
Texas does not have drop-off boxes for absentee ballots, as do some other states. Instead, to drop off a mail-in ballot in person at any location, voters must present an approved form of identification to a poll worker, and voters may not turn in any one elseâ€™s ballot.
Multiple voting right groups quickly challenged the governor's limiting order, and three Democratic chairs of high-profile congressional committees called the move an apparent "last-ditch effort to suppress Texansâ€™ ability to vote."
The litigation, one of a plethora on voting access in Texas during the fall election, was settled Tuesday evening with three days left of early voting. Election Day is Nov. 3.

The attacks followed a deadly raid on Saturday in the village of Ogassogou, home to the Fulani herding community, near the town of Mopti. Some 160 people died in the assault, local officials and security sources said.
A militia from the Dogon ethnic group -- a hunting and farming community with a long history of tension with the Fulani over access to land -- is suspected to have carried out Saturday's raid.
"This spiral of violence must cease immediately," the UN mission in Mali, MINUSMA, said in a statement.
A local councillor in the area, Oumar Diallo, said the Dogon village of Ouadou was "attacked by armed men".
"Houses were burnt, the provisional death toll is four dead. In another village around Bankass, two women were also killed," he told AFP.
A Malian security source confirmed the death toll, as did MINUSMA, which said the attack occurred on the night of Monday to Tuesday and added that "several houses were torched, cattle were stolen".
The UN rights office in Geneva said earlier Tuesday it had sent a team of investigators to the region.
Saturday's raid was the deadliest attack in Mali since the 2013 French-led military intervention that drove back jihadist groups who had taken control of the north of the country.
Jihadist raids remain a persistent threat, and in the centre of the country, an ethnic mosaic, the attacks have had a bloody impact on groups with a history of rivalry.
The Fulani have been accused of supporting a jihadist preacher, Amadou Koufa, who rose to prominence in central Mali four years ago.
So-called self-defence groups have emerged in the Dogon community in the declared role of providing protection against the insurgents.
But these militias have also used their status to attack the Fulani.
Violence between the Fulani and Dogon and between the Fulani and Bambara ethnic group claimed some 500 civilian lives last year, according to UN figures.""" ;

<https://www.thedailystar.net/country/bangladesh-general-election-can-delay-if-all-party-call-1656916> dct:description """The Election Commission seems to be in an unusual hurry to announce the schedule for the next parliamentary polls.
None of the four previous ECs had come up with polls schedule in such haste since the June 1996 polls.
After the beginning of 90-day countdown to hold the polls, each of the past ECs had taken one month on average to announce the schedule.
This time, things look very different.
The 90-day countdown began on October 31. And according to the constitutional provision, the EC must hold the parliamentary polls on or by January 28.
The commission, led by KM Nurul Huda, had earlier decided to announce the polls schedule on November 4, only four days after the beginning of the countdown.
It, however, refrained from doing so in the wake of a request from Jatiya Oikyafront and the ongoing talks between the ruling and opposition parties.
The EC on the same day said it would unveil the schedule on Thursday.
The demand for delaying the announcement of the polls schedule is getting stronger. Those who are raising the demand have been focusing on a resolution to the ongoing political crisis before the announcement of the schedule.
But Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda yesterday categorically said, “There is no scope to defer the announcement of the polls schedule.”
Talking to reporters at a programme in the capital, he however said the date for polling could be delayed if all political parties wanted.
His stance does not match those of his predecessors in regards to announcement of the schedule.
Take for example the 2001 polls. The 90-day countdown to hold the eighth parliamentary election had begun on July 14, 2001 as the seventh parliament was dissolved on the previous day on expiry of its five year term. It was a record as none of the previous parliaments completed a full five-year term.
On July 15, then chief justice Latifur Rahman was sworn into office as the chief adviser in a peaceful transition of power, first time in Bangladesh's history.
The then EC, led by CEC MA Syed, had announced the election schedule on August 19, 35 days after the beginning of the 90-day countdown.
The commission had taken the highest time to announce the schedule although there was no political crisis over holding the election.
When the country was going through political crisis over the parliamentary elections in 2006 and 2013, the then ECs had announced the polls schedules 30 days after the beginning of the 90-day countdown.
On both occasions, the announcement of the schedules aggravated the political crisis resulting in the declaration of the state of emergency in early 2007 and holding a one-sided Jatiya Sangsad election in January, 2014.
In one instance, the EC had taken only a week to announce the schedule for the fifth parliamentary polls in 1991. But the political situation was quite different back then. In the face of a mass upsurge, HM Ershad stepped down as president on December 6, 1990, after dissolving the fourth parliament.
Before his resignation, Ershad had appointed then chief justice Shahabuddin Ahmed as vice president. Shahabuddin was a choice of all opposition political parties, including the Awami League and the BNP. After the resignation of Ershad, Shahabuddin performed as the acting president.
As all political parties agreed with the acting president's plan for holding polls as early as possible, the then EC announced the schedule on December 15, nine days after dissolution of the fourth parliament.
The country is now facing an usual political crisis over the next parliamentary polls though there is no violent street agitation like before.
The country is already seeing some positive signs of politics as the ruling and opposition parties have been holding dialogues on the upcoming polls.
The opposition parties fear the situation may get worse if the EC announces the schedule before resolving the crisis through talks.
Talking to The Daily Star, M Hafizuddin Khan, an adviser to the caretaker government in 2001, said he didn't understand why the EC was in a hurry for announcing the election schedule when there was enough time for holding the election.
“There will be no loss on the part of the Election Commission if it waits for several more days to see whether the ongoing dialogue yields any positive result.”
The polls schedule can be announced any day at the end of this month, keeping 40 to 45 day's gap between the announcement of the schedule and the polling day.
Election Commissioner Rafiqul Islam said the commission might consider deferring the date of announcing the schedule if all political parties reached a consensus on the issue.
“Otherwise, I don't think there is any scope to delay the announcement of the election schedule as there are different occasions like the Christmas Day, New Years Eve, distribution of free textbooks at the beginning of January, and Bishwa Ijtema,” he told The Daily Star.
He said the EC would sit in a meeting tomorrow to finalise the date for announcing the schedule after discussing the latest political developments.""" ;

<https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-100390> dct:description """BANGLADESH began its journey as an independent country with a parliamentary system of government. It had been a foregone conclusion in the context of the Awami League, which was at the helm of the country's affairs following the liberation war. Tragically, however, the first blow to the AL's cherished form of government came from the party itself in January 1975 when Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh as a one-party state with a presidential form of government. Since then Bangladesh has gone through military and civil-military authoritarian rule before the parliamentary form of government was reintroduced in Bangladesh in 1991 through the 12th amendment to the constitution. It was indeed a positive development since the amendment was carried through bipartisan move i.e., with the consensus of the two major political parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League. Great hope was raised in the country about the successful operation of parliamentary government. Unfortunately, however, expectations regarding an effective parliamentary system ensuring good governance in the country remained as elusive as ever despite bringing in the institution of non-party, neutral caretaker government, against the backdrop of confrontation between the AL and the BNP over the holding of free and fair elections.
In this context, Bangladesher Shongshodiyo Gonotantra, Rajniti O Governance: 1991-2007 by Professor Al Masud Hasanuzzaman deserves special attention. The author covers a period which has been very critical in our attempts to restore and stabilize our much vaunted democratic order, and critically analyses where we went wrong and what needs to be done in order to rectify the mistakes. He begins his book by giving a meaningful theoretical and historical account of the evolution of parliament in Great Britain. He then goes on to discuss how the British colonial rulers helped its phase-wise growth in the British Indian subcontinent, and how erstwhile Pakistan, after its independence from British rule in 1947, struggled to establish a functional parliament and how its experimentation failed, giving rise to the facade of a presidential form of government. This historical account will generate huge interest about parliament and the parliamentary form of government itself.
The second chapter is devoted to the actual functioning of parliament in Bangladesh during 1991-2007. In this context, the author analyses the issues in detail, beginning from the structure of the House, composition of the Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Parliaments, the legislative procedure of each House, a chronological development through which women's participation in parliament was ensured. The most outstanding discussion of this chapter is the author's analysis of the Committee System. His analysis covers the slow and gradual evolution of the Committee System from the Fifth through the Eighth Parliaments and pinpoints the weaknesses of the system. He concludes by stating that the achievements of the Committee System in Parliament since 1991 till 2007 have been mixed and the outcome is not very helpful.
The third chapter is about the party system in Bangladesh. It is common knowledge that parties are the 'life-lines' of democracy. Without a democratic and functional party system democracy cannot take root in any country. And Bangladesh is no exception. Unfortunately, however, as the author points out, the evolution of an effective and democratic party-system, which could have been the precursors of Bangladesh politics, did not happen in the then Pakistan. It is discerned that politics in the then East Pakistan (as part of erstwhile Pakistan) was characterized by civil-military authoritarian rule, and as such, in the absence of a democratic process the political development of political parties remained elusive. Similar development is also discerned in the political history of Bangladesh. The regrettable fact is that the political parties in Bangladesh, even during the much vaunted democratic order beginning in 1991, did not evolve into effective democratic institutions. The author in this chapter gives an account of the malaise that afflicts the major political parties, including the much needed internal democracy within the political parties.
In chapter four, the discussion revolves around a very interesting phenomenon in Bangladesh. Such a phenomenon came to the fore in the context of holding free and fair elections against the backdrop of alleged rigging in a Magura by-election when the major opposition party, the AL, propagated the idea that no free and fair elections could take place under a party government. The author reflects on why such a unique concept of a non-partisan caretaker government, in order to hold a free and fair elections, was incorporated, through the 13th amendment, into the constitution of the country. He also highlights the amended constitutional provisions as well as the caretaker regime's functioning and how it became controversial over the years, giving rise to an army-backed caretaker government that remained in power for two years instead of its constitutionally ordained mandate of three years. The future of democracy and its stabilization depended on a free and fair election under the aegis of a controversial army-backed caretaker government.
In the concluding chapter, the author cites various reasons for which even after the restoration of the parliamentary system in 1991, democratic order could not be established fully. The failure to establish a functional parliament has been cited as a major cause that has undermined the stabilization of democracy and good governance in the country. The author's recommendations in this regard are noteworthy and must be looked into and considered by the relevant segments of society.
Professor Al Masud Hasanuzzaman deserves our special thanks for bringing issues relating to a functional parliament and good governance in the country under one cover. He has remained focused all through on the issues concerned and provided recommendations that could alleviate the situation. The book is informative, has a rich bibliography and is a noteworthy reference work for a wide range of readers. The volume is thus required reading for all academics, researchers, and students both at home and abroad.

It was his sagacity, steadfastness and unwavering commitment to democracy that helped us back on the path to democracy after having lost it with the murder of Bangabandhu.
In a remarkable display of courage, leadership, clarity of vision, impartiality and unfaltering commitment to national interest, Justice Shahabuddin gave us what was till then an impossible dream -- a free, fair and peaceful election. His 306 days Presidency was low on profile and high or performance. He was not an actor of the events that propelled him to the centre stage power but a superb manger of the consequences of those events -- starting from organising and running the interim government, to convincing all the political parties to follow his plan, to holding a free and fair election and finally creating his own replacement and returning to the judiciary where he came from and where he wanted to return to.
In an editorial title “Tribute to Shahabuddin” published on the eve of his departure from Presidency this paper wrote, on Oct 10, 1991:
“We have had leaders of many kinds: charismatic, visionary, intellectual and of course corrupt. But never one as unassuming, low-key, committed, focused and so completely devoid of any inclination to cling to power. As he left the office of the President, Justice Shahbuddin stood tall and for his accomplishments the nation stood taller.”
We wanted to include him in the Honour Roll of the “Lifetime Achievers” but the lifelong shy and low-key person refused spotlight even at the sunset of his life.
On our 25th Anniversary we remember him with gratitude for what he did and with pride of what he stood for.
-Editor
Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, former President of Bangladesh, was born on February 1, 1930, at Pemal village under Kendua thana of Netrakona district. An outstanding student, he completed his BA (Hons) in Economics in 1951 and MA in International Relations in 1952 from Dhaka University. He also attended a special course in on Public Administration in the University of Oxford, following his entry into the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP) in 1954.
During his career as an administrator – a role in which he excelled – he served as a Sub-Divisional Officer of Gopalganj and Natore, before being promoted to the post of Additional Deputy Commissioner of Faridpur.
He was transferred to the judicial branch in June 1960, and appointed the Registrar of the Dhaka High Court in 1967. He was promoted to the bench as a judge of the High Court of Bangladesh on January 20, 1972, and subsequently, appointed a judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on February 7, 1980.
Justice Shahabuddin was the chairman of the Commission of Enquiry formed to investigate the causes of police firing on agitating students of Dhaka University in 1983, which led to the deaths of several students. His detailed report, however, was never made public by the then government.
He served as chairman of Bangladesh Red Cross Society from August 1978 to April 1982.
Shahabuddin Ahmed was appointed Chief Justice of Bangladesh on 14 January 1990. On December 6, as the country celebrated the fall of Ershad and the end of autocratic rule, he assumed the position of Acting President of the country. It was under his leadership that a non-partisan caretaker government was formed, and a free and fair election held in the country in February 1991. He amended a number of draconian laws, which revived freedom of the press and freedom of expression in the country. After successfully completing his term as Acting President, he left the Bangabhaban on Oct 10, 1991 and resumed his duties as Chief Justice, before finally retiring on February 1, 1995. He left behind a sovereign parliament, a popularly elected leadership, a unanimously adopted form of government and, most importantly, a Constitution that has been shorn of its undemocratic features.
Justice Shahabuddin was elected the President of the country on July 23, 1996 having been nominated by the Awami League government. He was sworn-in as the President on October 9, 1996 and retired from the Presidency on November 14, 2001.""" ;

OSAKA, March 28 KyodoA psychiatrist at the Osaka District Court said Thursday that Mamoru Takuma, the suspect in an Osaka school massacre last year that left eight children dead, did not show any symptoms of schizophrenia.During the sixth hearing of Takuma's trial, the prosecution witness said he initially diagnosed Takuma with schizophrenia, but later determined he suffered from a paranoid personality disorder, after he conducted assessments of Takuma for about a two-year period after a 1999 incident.Takuma, 38, was in 1999 arrested on suspicion of mixing tranquilizers into tea served at an elementary school in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, where he worked.In his testimony Thursday, the psychiatrist said he examined Takuma with a different doctor in April 1999 and diagnosed him with schizophrenia after Takuma complained of auditory hallucinations.Takuma, however, appeared composed, the psychiatrist said, adding that this made him suspicious. Even after he was discharged from a stay in hospital, Takuma repeatedly returned to the hospital and was eventually hospitalized again, but failed to exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia, the psychiatrist said.In May last year before the stabbing massacre, the Kobe prosecutors contacted the psychiatrist about Takuma in connection to a different assault case, and were told Takuma suffered from paranoid personality disorder.The psychiatrist told the court he was convinced Takuma suffered from paranoid personality disorder, changing his earlier diagnosis of schizophrenia.In a news conference the same day of the court hearing, Takuma's lawyers said they are planning to request that Takuma be examined again, this time by a psychotherapist, as well as undergo another psychiatric evaluation.In a psychotherapeutic examination, subjects undergo a psychological analysis to thoroughly probe their personality and character, which may help clarify Takuma's motives for committing the crime, according to lawyers.The examination differs from a psychiatric evaluation aimed at assessing a suspect's mental capacity rather than personality or character traits.According to the indictment, Takuma broke into the state-run Ikeda Elementary School in Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture, on June 8 last year, stabbed eight children to death, and injured 13 other children and two teachers.He pleaded guilty at the first hearing of his trial.Takuma's lawyers, however, demanded the court carefully judge the competency of their client, saying he may have killed in a state of temporary insanity due to an innate psychopathic personality.Takuma has a record of psychiatric treatment and appeared to be mentally unstable immediately after his arrest.""" ;

Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press
In the final moments of a mass shooting on a crowded Toronto street, attacker Faisal Hussain came face to face with a frightened resident. Armed with a handgun and moments from his own death, he told the man his life would be spared.
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to shoot you," Mr. Hussain said.
Investigators documented the chance encounter on Tuesday as they went door to door, interviewing witnesses of Sunday’s attack that left 18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis dead. Thirteen other victims, ranging in age from 17 to 59, were injured as Mr. Hussain, 29, crisscrossed Danforth Avenue around 10 p.m., firing at pedestrians and businesses.
Mr. Hussain died in front of a church at the southwest corner of Danforth Avenue and Bowden Street after a shootout with police.
Open this photo in gallery Toronto police have identified Julianna Kozis of Markham as the 10-year-old girl who was killed in a shooting rampage in the city's Greektown on Sunday. The Canadian Press
Just moments before, neighbourhood resident Jaspal Singh was cutting through a laneway on his way to his restaurant on the busy Danforth strip when he ran into the gunman. On Tuesday, Mr. Singh’s wife, who asked that her name not be used, confirmed the details of the encounter to The Globe and Mail outside their home. But she said her husband was still shaken up and not ready to speak with the media. She said the province’s Special Investigations Unit – a civilian agency that probes deaths or serious injuries involving police in Ontario – had been by that morning to interview him.
It’s unknown how Mr. Hussain selected his victims or what motivated the attack. His family has said in a statement that he had “severe mental-health challenges,” including a lifelong struggle with depression and psychosis.
The Toronto Police Service said on Tuesday that it could not comment, citing the continuing investigations by both police and the SIU. TPS spokeswoman Meghan Gray said the probe is still in its early stages and that “we will not make any determination on a motive until we have the evidence.”
Detectives continue to conduct interviews and execute search warrants, she said, and are looking at the suspect’s online activities. “All that work takes time."
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said on Tuesday that, at this point in the shooting investigation, there is no known “nexus” between Mr. Hussain and national security.
“There is no national-security connection between this individual and any other national-security issue,” Mr. Goodale said.

An autopsy was conducted on Mr. Hussain’s body on Tuesday. However, the SIU would not release whether Mr. Hussain’s gunshot wound was self-inflicted or caused by police.
“The postmortem results are considered to be evidence so we would not release that while the investigation was ongoing,” SIU spokeswoman Monica Hudon said, noting that even if Mr. Hussain is found to have died by suicide, the SIU would not necessarily end its investigation. “Every case is different and we would have to look at the entire situation or the entire incident to make a determination on what we’re going to do with the case."
The SIU said on Tuesday evening it has designated two subject officers and four witness officers in its investigation.
It is in possession of the handgun used by Mr. Hussain and is making arrangements to send it to the Centre of Forensic Sciences for analysis, Ms. Hudon said.
Toronto Police are also investigating the origin of the gun used by Mr. Hussain.
Open this photo in gallery The family of Toronto shooter Faisal Hussain provided the media with a photo of the 29-year-old on Tuesday. Law enforcement continues to investigate the circumstances of Sunday's shooting, including how Mr. Hussain obtained the gun he used.
“How Mr. Hussain obtained a firearm is part of our ongoing investigation, but we are not prepared to release those details at this time,” Ms. Gray said.
One of the final spots that was targeted by Mr. Hussain on Sunday night was the 7Numbers restaurant, at the southeast corner of Danforth and Bowden. On Tuesday morning, restaurateur Vito Marinuzzi was busy replacing the bullet-riddled side door of the Italian bistro.
He was not there during the attack and could not believe the news when his staff called him from inside the restaurant.
After hearing gunshots down the street, around Logan Avenue, the servers rushed their customers in from the patio.
They drew the blinds and hid – some behind the bar and others in the basement – as they awaited police. At one point, Mr. Marinuzzi said, a woman who he was told “wanted to help” took a look out the side door of the restaurant, onto Bowden Avenue. The shooter, he said, was right there. Shots were fired and the woman was hit. She was pulled back inside by the others.
The door, with clear bullet holes, had been taken down and was leaned up against the restaurant wall on Tuesday as Mr. Marinuzzi tried to decide what to do with it. He was worried about making it as “easy as possible” for his staff to come to work that evening – their first time opening since the shooting.
When Mr. Marinuzzi went inside the restaurant on Monday, escorted by police who wanted a copy of his surveillance footage, he was struck by the chaos left behind. Meals were still sitting on tables, but chairs had been flipped and wine glasses had been knocked over, marking the path that patrons had taken in the scramble to hide.
“It was really an awful thing,” he said of the scene. “It was something I wasn’t prepared for.”
But he was also struck by the dozens of phone messages and e-mails from customers looking to check in or book a table. That solidarity, he said, is comforting. So he and his staff decided to reopen on Tuesday evening.
“This is not going to knock us down,” he said of the shooting. “We’re not going to let it stop us, or tarnish the neighbourhood.”
Indeed, mourners came out in droves as soon as the street reopened on Monday, stopping into the handful of businesses that were operating and leaving flowers and candles in a tribute to the victims. A vigil is planned for Wednesday night.
The city’s Community Crisis Response Program – which works with communities in the immediate hours and days after a traumatic event – has been called in. On Tuesday, a representative was going door to door along Bowden Street, offering information to residents about available supports.

One neighbour, who lives just a couple doors south of Mr. Marinuzzi’s restaurant, was emotional on Tuesday morning as she recalled the traumatic event.
Janet – who asked that her full name not be published because she can’t release her address for professional reasons – said she and her family were home on Sunday night and heard the gunshots followed by sirens. She said they got down and stayed away from the windows, so they did not see what was happening.
Her husband did get a glimpse of a man in a black cap going down the laneway across from their house, she said – which was cordoned off by police on Monday – but she said he couldn’t be sure it was the gunman.
“I’m surprised at how emotional I am [talking about it],” she said. “But our whole lives are here. You just think about your kids, your kids’ friends.”
Janet said she has been worried all summer about her teenage daughter, who works at a job in downtown Toronto and comes home around 10 p.m. But because it was a Sunday, her daughter was home that night at 7 p.m. She is relieved they were all safe inside.
“But I mean, everyone around here is always out on the Danforth,” she said. “We’re always at the Second Cup, there’s a little ice cream shop beside there – it’s the ‘what ifs’ afterwards. Thankfully, thankfully, it didn’t affect us. But it did affect somebody else.”

Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said Saturday that Ottawa has an emergency response program in place to assess whether damaged areas warrant federal assistance.
The aid decision will be the result of a calculation carried out over the coming days, said Van Loan, who was touring homes wrecked by a tornado that touched down two days earlier in Vaughan, Ont.
“It's not a political thing. It's a complex mathematical formula,” Mr. Van Loan said.
While municipalities and provinces had the first level of responsibility to communities ravaged by the storm, the federal government is available to assist “when we can,” said Mr. Van Loan.
Officials in Vaughan estimate at least 600 homes were damaged by Thursday's twister and more than 40 are beyond repair. The destruction was so bad that the city had declared a state of emergency.
“I am struck by the degree of damage that has been wrought,” said Mr. Van Loan as he stood in front of a home whose roof had been ripped off.
“It is remarkable that the level of personal injury is as low as it is.”
The string of twisters also claimed the life of an 11-year-old boy in Durham, Ont. and left hundreds homeless.
Vaughan Mayor Linda Jackson and York Regional police Chief Armand La Barge accompanied Mr. Van Loan as he took in the tornado's aftermath.
“There's still a lot of devastation,” said Ms. Jackson, adding that all parts of the city were pulling together to restore a degree of normalcy as soon as possible.
“It's going to be a long time before some of these residents are back in their homes,” Ms. Jackson said as she hugged and consoled homeowners who stood in the streets, gazing up at the shambles that used to be their homes.
Ms. Jackson later said the state of emergency would be lifted by 6 p.m. Saturday.

At least four men are dead and a woman is injured after a man believed to be an associate of an outlaw motorcycle gang newly released from prison allegedly went on a shooting rampage in Darwin’s city centre.
On Tuesday night Northern Territory police arrested the suspected shooter on a Darwin city street. He remains under police guard in a Darwin hospital, with police expected to lay charges on Wednesday.
On Wednesday the NT police commissioner Reece Kershaw said the man, who was released from jail on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time of the shooting and was “well known to us”.
The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. A man was killed at the motel before three other deaths occurred at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner.
Witness Leah Potter told the Today Show she had followed a police officer to the scene of the shooting at the motel.
“We followed him, and the scene that we came across, I could not even believe that this could happen in Darwin,” she said.
“A man had come through the Palms Motel and shot every window.”
She said the man was looking for someone, and after shooting up the motel he allegedly found his target and shot him dead.
Potter said the man was well known. “He’s a local Darwin lad that all of us know. So it’s quite shocking,” she said.

Kershaw confirmed that the suspect had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time. A shotgun was used but its exact type is not yet known.
“We’re still trying to establish the intent and the motivation behind this,” Kershaw told reporters. He said the shooting was not terrorism-related. Asked if the man was a member of the Rebels motorcycle gang, Kershaw said he may have associated with them.
Kershaw said the man may have been trying to hand himself in to police and urged members of the public who had information or video footage to contact the force.
Witnesses told the ABC that the man had walked into the Palms Motel and opened fire with a pump-action shotgun just before 6pm on Tuesday.
A group of about a dozen men who were friends and relatives of a man who died at the motel gathered outside after the shooting, many in tears.
Matthew James was standing in a car park nears the Palms when it all began. “It was just surreal,” he told Nine’s Today program on Wednesday. “All of a sudden there were these gunshots.
“Moments later someone came running towards me carrying this woman who was covered in blood and just basically put her at my feet and she was screaming that she had been shot.
“The guy that actually carried her up was pretty frantic at the time, saying he had opened the door and there was a gunman there with a shotgun and he proceeded to fire upon anybody inside the building.”
James said the woman was hysterical. “She was caught up in it, she said, ‘I’ve been shot, I don’t know why, I don’t have anything to do with anything.’
The woman told James the shooter had been going from room to room, firing his gun and shouting the name of a man – Alex.
“It just seems so insane,” James said.
Chris Dalgleish, who was having a beer on the balcony of the Frontier Hotel pub across the road from the Palms, said people had raced inside when they realised someone was shooting.
“Everyone started jumping inside, then locking doors and windows and went to the back corner,” he told Australian Associated Press.
John Rose told the ABC he had seen a gunman walk into the motel with “a sawn-off shotgun”. “He shot up all the rooms and he went to every room looking for somebody and he shot them all up. Then we saw him rush out, jump into his Toyota pick-up, and rush off.”
He said the gunman had appeared calm. “Once he left we went in and found one gentleman, he’s over there, we pulled him out,” Rose said.
Leah Potter said the gunman had been armed with a pump-action shotgun and had shot a woman through her hotel room door.
“I was in the car park [of a neighbouring hotel] when I heard what I thought were fireworks going off, really loud cracking, banging fireworks,” she told the ABC. “This lady turned up and started screaming, and we didn’t realise there was another person in there … apparently he’s dead, he’s been shot.”
The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, said thoughts were with the families and friends of the victims. “This is not the Darwin we know,” he told reporters.
A police duty superintendent, Lee Morgan, told the Guardian shortly after the shooting there were “four deceased and a number of other people who have been shot”.

Morgan said police had first received calls about shots being fired at 5.50pm local time.
The alleged gunman was finally arrested by NT police without incident at 6.45pm at the busy Stuart Highway and McMinn Street intersection. Officers expect to lay charges against him on Wednesday.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been in touch with the Northern Territory chief minister.
“This is a terrible act of violence,” he told reporters in London. “I just want to extend my deep condolences and sympathies to all the people in the territory, particularly in Darwin. This is a very tight community and I know they will be rocked by these events.”
A Royal Darwin hospital spokeswoman, Sally Edwards, said the emergency department was treating a woman with leg wounds who was in a stable condition.""" ;

<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/the-observer-view-on-the-nigerian-elections-february-2015> dct:description """Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria’s president, finally made it to Borno state last week, almost two weeks after the Islamist terrorist group known as Boko Haram seized the town of Baga and killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians. Jonathan, making a brief tour of the state capital, Maiduguri, congratulated the army on its work, notwithstanding its abject failure to prevent the massacre. “We thank you as a nation. Terrorism is a global phenomenon. We’re working day and night, trying to curtail this madness,” he said.
What Jonathan did not say was how he plans to break Boko Haram’s grip on 20,000sq km of territory spanning three north-eastern states or bring an end to the plague of murderous atrocities, suicide bombings, schoolgirl kidnappings and rapes it has unleashed.
The president is frequently criticised for inaction as the violence worsens. It sometimes seems he is trying to ignore a problem for which he has no answers. On average, an estimated 27 Nigerians were killed every day in terror-related attacks in 2014. Around 16,000 have died since 2009. Jonathan remained silent for many days after Baga, but immediately sent his condolences to France following the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Boko Haram’s loathsome leader, Abubakar Shekau, meanwhile expressed “joy” at the Paris killings.
Many reasons are given for Nigeria’s evident inability to defeat, or even contain, an insurgency whose ostensible aim is to create an Islamic caliphate under sharia law. As Africa’s biggest economy, commanding Africa’s largest standing army, the country does not lack means. What it does plainly lack is effective political and military leadership. The 130,000-strong army is poorly equipped, trained and led and, say reports, outgunned by Boko Haram. Funding to fight the insurgency is allegedly lost to corruption. Jonathan, it is claimed, has neither the clout nor the inclination to confront incompetent or venal commanding officers in a country with a history of military dictatorship. So he peddles the idea that since terrorism is global, there is a not much one government alone can do.
What Nigerians think about this deadly, do-little dilly-dallying may soon become clear, as the country prepares for presidential, parliamentary, gubernatorial and local elections on 14 February. In what is predicted to be the closest contest since democracy was restored, Jonathan, strong in the largely Christian south and seeking a second term, faces a stiff challenge from opposition parties united behind the candidacy of Muhammadu Buhari, from the Muslim-majority north. A former military coup leader, Buhari earned a reputation for strong leadership and intolerance of corruption during his brief period in power in 1983-85. Analysts suggest that intense public yearning for an end to Boko Haram’s nihilism and to instability caused by rising communal, criminal and political violence may help the challenger, by overriding traditional voting patterns based on religious and ethnic affiliations.
This possibility helps explain Jonathan’s surprise visit to Borno, his first since declaring a state of emergency there in 2013. The prospect that continuing Boko Haram attacks may disrupt the polls in the north-east, or even lead to their cancellation, is another concern. If election returns are incomplete, the loser may reject the national result. To win the presidency, a candidate must obtain at least 25% of the vote in at least 24 of Nigeria’s 36 states. Concerned by spillover into Chad, Niger and Cameroon and by Nigeria’s political and military weakness, West African leaders will meet this week to discuss creation of a multinational force to fight Boko Haram.
Terrorism is far from being the only shadow hanging over the elections. Bad blood between the two main political alliances, inadequate preparations by the electoral commission and apparent pro-government bias by state agencies and the security forces may compound north-south friction and provoke factional violence. All the signs “suggest the country is heading toward a very volatile and vicious electoral contest”, said a recent report by the International Crisis Group.
All Nigeria’s political leaders bear a heavy responsibility to do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the divisive 2011 poll, when more than 800 people died in post-election mayhem. But partisan name-calling and inflammatory rhetoric has already begun. As one analyst noted: “Events suggest it may not be Boko Haram and a deteriorated security situation that is the greatest threat to the Nigerian elections, but the behaviour of the Nigerian political elite.”""" ;

<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jan/16/boko-haram-goodluck-jonathan-wef-young-global-leaders> dct:description """Dear president Jonathan,
As young global leaders we would like to express our deep concern about the recent events in Nigeria.
The massacre in Baga has been Boko Haram’s deadliest so far, despite reports of your brief visit to Maiduguri, you’ve publicly said nothing. More disturbing still is the fact that you would send a message to France condemning the killings there, yet seem unable to address the Nigerian people who look to you for leadership.
Unfortunately, it’s not the first time you’ve met calamity with insouciance. On 10 November 2014 a suicide bomber killed 47 people and injured 79 others. The following day, with barely a mention of this horrific incident targeting children, you launched your re-election campaign.
Despite the ease with which you move on, even you will remember the abduction of the schoolgirls in Chibok in April last year. It was 40 days before you addressed the country on that occasion. Nigerians waited, perplexed, as your government debated whether or not the abductions had even taken place. As a result, of all the girls captured, only 52 have secured their freedom – escaping on their own. The rest are still in captivity, still waiting to be rescued, months after being taken from their friends, family and community.
Could it be that your government also doubts that the Baga attacks happened? Amnesty International’s satellite images confirm that indeed a massacre took place, and as many as 2,000 people are dead. Yet your army wastes time contesting the numbers.
Whether 150 or 2,000, we’d like to hear from you on your government’s plans to secure the region and to bear witness to the loss of lives in Baga. We have seen a clear incompetency in handling matters of national interest. In the context of existing ethnic and religious fault lines, silence only says that Nigeria’s government does not care about the victims and is not dealing with the insurgency.
True, the global community has also failed to maintain pressure on a government that seems ambivalent about fulfilling its constitutional role to secure the lives and properties of its citizens.
With more than 150,000 people who have fled their homes, swelling camps within Nigeria and overwhelming border communities, it seems the only hope to see you act is international outrage. It was this that finally forced you to address the nation and the world after the Chibok abductions. It was only then that you reached out to other countries and, with their help, agreed a plan for a regional security force to secure the porous borders between Nigeria, Niger and Chad where Boko Haram roams undeterred.
Perhaps, had international pressure been sustained last year, a multi-regional force would have been based in Baga as planned. Perhaps it would have been strong enough to repel Boko Haram when the militants attacked on 3 January. Perhaps 2,000 lives could have been saved.
But Isis struck and the world moved on, leaving a small national military unit to stand between hundreds of armed militants and a town of 10,000 people. We now know what happened. The world has seen pictures of bodies still strewn around the forest and river where they died.
If these deaths do not generate the attention, outcry and action that they ought to, we can only prepare the ground for more bodies because Boko Haram shows no sign of relenting. The insurgents can be defeated but first you must decide if the lives of Nigerians are worth it.
Break the silence, President. Call for global attention and support to prevent further loss of life – and it must be said – silence those who think that African leaders care nothing for their people.
Be the voice for the thousands of innocent people who have died and the millions who yearn for peace. They have the right to rebuild their communities and claim their place in the unfolding rise of the African continent.

<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2010/nov/22/weatherwatch-great-storm-1703-daniel-defoe> dct:description """Like all good reporters Daniel Defoe noted curious details, so amid the wreckage of the Great Storm of 26 November, 1703, he recorded that more tiles were blown off the lee side of houses than the sides facing the wind. Small buildings that were sheltered behind larger ones frequently lost entire roofs. Less damage occurred to prominent houses bearing the full force of the gale.
Defoe put this down to eddies in the air currents, which was almost right. It is now known as the Bernoulli effect after the physicist who later explained the phenomenon scientifically. He showed that very strong winds cause a partial vacuum on the lee side of the roof ridge. This can be sufficiently powerful to lift or suck the tiles into the air.
The same principle is used to make aircraft take off or to hold racing cars on the road. The shape of wings or an aerofoil creates air pressure that can push up or down.
Defoe describes dozens of other events that bear witness to the strength of the wind. He was fascinated that in many parts of England the lead on churches and public buildings, including Westminster Abbey roof and Christ Church Hospital in London, was "rolled up like a roll of parchment and blown in some places clear off the building."
He records 400 windmills being overturned or destroyed: in some the sails turned so fast that the friction caused the wooden wheels to overheat and catch fire, burning them down.""" ;

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/02/russia.pollution> dct:description """In fact, three regions of southern Siberia — a vast area of industrial towns, pine trees and the odd bear — today reported the same mysterious phenomenon. Not only was the snow not white, it also smelt bad. Most of the snow was orange. But some of it was red and yellow as well, officials confirmed, after scrambling to the affected areas to dig up samples. And it was also oily, they discovered.
Russian officials in the Omsk region, 1,400 miles from Moscow, swiftly warned local residents not to touch the snow or feed it to their animals.
"At the present moment we cannot give explanations for the snow, which is oily to the touch and has a pronounced rotten smell. We are waiting for the results of a thorough test on samples," Omsk's environmental prosecutor, Anton German, said this morning.
Russian scientists trying to solve the mystery faced a tricky problem. The region is home to so many polluting industries it was hard to identify which one might have been responsible. Could it have been the nuclear plant in nearby Mayak? Or the metallurgy and chemicals factory in Ust-Kamenogorsk? The region is next to north Kazakhstan, a vast area of steppe used by the Soviet Union to conduct its nuclear tests. Or might the rogue snow have been caused by fuel from the space rockets launched in Kazakhstan?
Today environmental campaigners said that Russia had suffered decades of pollution — nuclear, industrial, and radioactive.
"I have to admit yellow snow is pretty unusual," said Vladimir Sliviak, the chairman of the Russian environmental group Ecodefence. "I can think of only two other cases in the last decade.
"This area of Siberia is beautiful. It's classic Russian forest. There is a lot of snow. There are a few bears and plenty of wolves as well. It's OK in terms of biodiversity."
This afternoon Russia's emergency situations ministry offered an explanation. Officials said a storm in neighbouring Kazakhstan had swept up clay and dust, dumping it on parts of the Tomsk and Omsk regions.
Not everyone was convinced. Russia's environmental watchdog said the snow contained four times higher than normal quantities of iron as well as acids and nitrates. "I don't believe this came from a storm. If we discover that it is an industrial entity that produced this pollution criminal charges will be opened," said Oleg Mitvol, the deputy head of Russia's environmental watchdog.""" ;

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/10/weather> dct:description """The storm battering the coast of Britain may be causing panic and threatening disruption, but it looks unlikely to be as bad as previous gales to have struck the country.
The worst storm ever recorded in the UK struck in the 18th century, damaging property, felling trees and killing thousands.
The "Great Storm" hit southern Britain on the night of November 26 1703. By the next morning, between 8,000 and 15,000 people were dead, many of them on ships sunk at sea. Church spires were destroyed, tiles and chimney stacks covered the streets, and more than 400 windmills were broken.
One ship, belonging to Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, was blown across the North Sea to Sweden.
On October 14 1881, a storm struck Berwickshire, south-east Scotland. Nearly 200 fishermen, mostly from the village of Eyemouth, died in what residents still call Black Friday.
In 1953 hurricane-force winds led to a disastrous storm surge in which 300 people drowned.
On January 31 and February 1 that year, the surge engulfed the east coast from the Wash down to Essex, reaching 2.74 metres at Southend, Essex, and 2.97 metres at King's Lynn, Norfolk. From Yorkshire to the Thames Estuary, coastal defences were pounded by the sea until they gave way.
Nearly 24,000 houses were damaged and 72,845 hectares (180,000 acres) flooded, while thousands of trees were blown down in Scotland. A car ferry, the Princess Victoria, on passage from Stranraer, Scotland, to Larne, Northern Ireland, sank with the loss of 133 lives - only 41 of the passengers and crew survived.
The worst storm since 1703 occurred in October 1987, making landfall in Cornwall before travelling north-east towards Devon and over the Midlands.
Gusts of wind reaching about 100mph were recorded at the south-east of the storm, mainly affecting Essex and Kent.
The storm caused £1.5bn worth of damage, uprooted 15 million trees and killed 18 people. Cars were destroyed, roofs torn off buildings, and a pier on the Isle of Wight ripped to pieces.
In October 2000, during the UK's wettest autumn for 200 years, a storm caused five major rivers to reach record flood levels, causing an estimated £1bn worth of damage. Gusts of 93mph left about 60,000 houses in the East Midlands without power.""" ;

<https://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/indiana-law-to-be-reviewed-after-noblesville-shooting-suspect-tried-as-a-child> dct:description """INDIANAPOLIS -- After the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office announced the suspect in the Noblesville school shooting will be tried as a juvenile, one of Indiana's top lawmakers said he will be reviewing possible changes to the criminal code.
The suspect in the shooting on May 25 at Noblesville West Middle School is 13 years old, meaning he is below the minimum age for the acts to be considered "adult" crimes. Because of his age and the fact that neither victim was killed in the shooting, the prosecuting attorney petitioned for the suspect to be charged as a "delinquent child," meaning that he committed acts that would be a felony or misdemeanor crimes if they were committed by an adult.
RTV6 is not naming the suspect because he is not being charged as an adult.
House Speaker Brian Bosma said he will be reviewing current laws in relation to charging juveniles as adults.
"In light of the Noblesville West Middle School incident and the recent charges brought against the shooter, we are reviewing current state law in regards to juveniles being charged as adults," Bosma said in a statement. "Given the heinous acts that led to a teacher and student being seriously harmed, I think it's important for us to take a thoughtful look at our criminal code and whether changes to the law are appropriate."
Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb agreed with Bosma's statement to review the criminal code for any possible changes.
"I think it's open for discussion," Holcomb said. "I think in this case, the law is the law. We'll administer it appropriately. But I do want to talk to some prosecutors and those on the front lines to take another look at this. So I concur with the Speaker on this that coming up in the next session, we're going to take a look at it."

Hogsett said in an interview Wednesday that it's important to take a "thoughtful" look at the criminal code and whether or not any changes to the law are appropriate.
"Obviously in this case, the law is the law," said Hogsett. "So, we'll administer it appropriately. But, I do want to talk to some prosecutors and those on the front lines to take another look at this."
Any possible changes wouldn't affect the Noblesville suspect, but it would impact any similar situations in the future.

Two weeks after the election, Clinton leads President-elect Donald Trump by 2 million votes.
Each day we learn more about the voter trends that shaped the outcome of the race. The latest story to emerge is that education played a significant role.
At FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver analyzed data from counties with 50,000 people or more. He found that Clinton performed well in places where people are more likely to have four-year degrees. In fact, Silver found, she "improved on President Obama’s 2012 performance in 48 of the country’s 50 most-well-educated counties."
Johnson County's education level is similar to that of San Francisco and counties with large college towns. Accordingly, it made the list of counties with a Clinton surge. Clinton lost to Trump by 2.7 percentage points, a big improvement over Obama, who four years ago was routed in Johnson County by 17.4 percentage points.
Silver's analysis indicates that Clinton also outperformed in Obama in Riley and Douglas counties in Kansas and Boone County in Missouri, the respective locations of Kansas State University, the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri.
Trump, by contrast, did well in the least educated counties. In one diploma-starved county in northeast Ohio that Obama carried easily in '12, Trump won by 19.0 percentage points — a mighty swing for the candidate who said at one point in the campaign, "I love the poorly educated!\"""" ;

<https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/07/25/danforth-shooter-was-afraid-he-was-going-to-hurt-people.html> dct:description """As a student at Victoria Park Collegiate Institute, Faisal Hussain was a “very disturbed” young man who spoke “a lot about the pain he was in and the voices that he heard,” says the former head of special education at the high school.
Enrolled in Focus on Success, a separate program for at-risk students, the skinny teen frequently voiced a fear he might hurt someone, and once repeatedly cut into his face with a pencil sharpener blade, prompting a call to police, says educator Jenessa Dworet.
“He was really scared of himself,” said Dworet. “He was afraid he was going to hurt people. He was very obsessed with guns.”
Hussain, 29, walked down a stretch of Danforth Ave. just after 10 p.m. Sunday night and opened fire, killing 10-year-old Julianna Kozis, 18-year-old Reese Fallon and injuring more than a dozen others. He died of a fatal gunshot wound after exchanging gunfire with two officers; authorities have not revealed the circumstances of his death, but police sources have said he shot himself.

Amid calls for more officers, data shows only a tenuous link with crime reduction
Dworet, who lives off the Danforth, heard the killer’s name but didn’t realize it was her former student until she saw Hussain’s photograph. She recognized the face of a young man who, nearly a decade ago, she would take on walks around the school neighbourhood in an effort to calm him down.
“It was chilling, because part of me was thinking: ‘What if he had done something like this while I worked with him?’ And part of me was thinking: ‘How could he have gone nine years without getting more support?’
“And that just breaks my heart, because I know he could have been a better person if he had had more support, or he at least could have been less of a threat to society,” she said.
Toronto police continue to investigate the shooting, while the province’s police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, probes Hussain’s death. Investigators are working to determine why — and how — Hussain obtained a gun and opened fire, including reviewing his online activity and his mental health history.
Responding to claims by Daesh Wednesday that Hussain’s actions were a terrorist attack in its name, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders issued a statement saying that “at this stage, we have no evidence to support these claims.”
Hussain’s family issued a statement Monday evening saying Hussain, one of four children, suffered from “severe mental health challenges,” and struggled with psychosis and depression. His parents had sought help for him but said the interventions of professionals were unsuccessful, and medications and therapy were “unable to treat him.”
Though Hussain himself had no criminal court files associated with his name, his older brother, Fahad Hussain, was last year charged with possessing ammunition, a charge stayed after the elder brother went into a coma from a drug overdose. CBC reported Wednesday that the gun used in the attack has been traced to the U.S. and Hussain may have obtained it from his brother.
Dworet says she met Hussain after he transferred to the Victoria Park school from Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute. Though she doesn’t know the specific circumstances, Dworet said she was told Hussain was determined to have posed a safety risk at Marc Garneau, possibly after bringing a weapon to school.
Ryan Bird, a spokesperson for the Toronto District School Board, said in an email that he could not release any information about current or former students due to privacy reasons and the ongoing police investigation.
“In general, when serious safety concerns are raised about a student, a threat assessment may be conducted by trained board staff to ensure the safety of school communities. This threat assessment can also include external agencies such as Toronto police,” Bird said.

Hussain’s family did not respond to requests for comment about their son’s behaviour in school.
Dworet recalls that police were summoned to school after an incident where Hussain deliberately began to “carve up his own face” with the blade from a pencil sharpener. She believes Hussain was cutting himself as a form of pain relief.
“We called the police, the head of the guidance department went with him to a (psychiatric facility), he waited for hours and hours, and he was finally admitted, then he was released the next day,” Dworet said.
The incident is illustrative, she said, of how Hussain doesn’t seem to have gotten the help he so clearly needed. To her and others, it was evident he was suffering and a threat to himself and others.
“He was calling for help, he knew that he was not a safe person, and yet there was nothing that anybody could do, other than bring him back to the psych ward periodically, I guess,” she said.
Hussain had also been mourning the loss of his 17-year-old sister, Faiza, who was killed in a car accident. Family friend Aamir Sukhera said that’s when Hussain’s mother asked him to “look after this one,” referring to Faisal.
After the accident, Sukhera said he went to the Hussain home and told the grieving three brothers that he would always be there for them and “I wanted to stay true to that.” Sukhera attempted to reach out to Hussain periodically, knowing his mental health challenges, and Hussain told him he was on medication.
When he ran into Hussain recently, Sukhera thought he was doing well.
“There was nothing to indicate that he was troubled,” he said. “What he did, it just doesn’t make sense.”
Dworet said that during their periodic walks around the school neighbourhood, she got glimpses of a young man who “wanted to do something different with his life (but) didn’t know how to get there.” She encouraged him to talk to his psychiatrist and to his mother.
“But it’s hard,” she said, “when you’re that lost.”""" ;

Toronto police officers answered it and spoke to his parents, who were unaware their son had just opened fire on a busy stretch of Danforth Ave., killing 18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and leaving 13 others injured.
Police included the cellphone detail in a just-released “information to obtain” (ITO) document, used to seek a warrant to search the home, at 43 Thorncliffe Park Dr., where the 29-year-old lived with his parents.
On Thursday, the Ministry of the Attorney General complied with Superior Court Justice David Corbett’s ruling ordering the partial release of three ITOs connected to the case: two searches of the Hussain family apartment and one of a police locker, containing property — most of it electronics, including cellphones and computers — which was then seized.
Corbett’s ruling comes after separate applications by the Star and other media to unseal the documents. Investigators obtained sealing orders, prohibiting the disclosure of the warrants and their grounds, on the basis that it could “compromise the nature and extent of an ongoing investigation,” according to court documents.
Minutes after his rampage on the evening of July 22, Hussain exchanged gunfire with two Toronto police officers near an alleyway on Bowden St. and fled toward the Danforth, where he was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, the ITO confirmed. Ontario’s police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), is probing Hussain’s death. SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon said Wednesday that investigators “are in the final stages of processing evidence.”

Toronto police Emergency Task Force officers, accompanied by an explosives dog, did not wait for a warrant to search the apartment that night: they entered it under “exigent circumstances, as there was a concern for human life” and a fear that there could be explosives there, according to one of the ITOs.
While Hussain’s parents voluntarily went to a police station, where they were interviewed, the tactical team officers found a sleigh bed with two drawers and located white powder, thought to be cocaine, and an Islamic headdress, among other items Corbett ruled cannot be made public.
Within hours of the carnage, Toronto police were making their case, to present to a justice of the peace, as to why they needed access to Hussain’s electronic communications, and why “the items sought will afford evidence to the offence.”
(Had he lived, Hussain would have been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempt murder.)
“It is reasonable to believe that this occurrence was planned and that items of planning, both tangible and on computer-based systems, will be located within his residence,” Toronto police wrote in the ITOs submitted to a justice of the peace.
“The accused’s electronic communications may have data pertaining to counselling or assisting other people carrying out similar attacks, or provide evidence of others counselling or inciting Faisal Hussain to commit his offence.”
Other previously unknown details emerge from the ITOs about Hussain’s final hours. They were based on police interviews with family members.
Hussain had a twin brother who is married. His first name was redacted in the court documents. On July 22, he was visiting his parents’ apartment. During the visit, at the request of his mother, he spoke to Hussain “about getting his life together, getting married and getting direction,” according to the twin brother’s police statement.
Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...
In the past, Hussain was receptive to such advice. But that afternoon he was not, calling himself “mentally retarded” numerous times and disappearing to the balcony for a smoke, the ITO says. Hussain was still at home when his brother left at 9 p.m.
An hour later, when he heard about what happened on the Danforth, his brother sent a text to Hussain telling him to stay home.
He told police his brother was deeply troubled and had “started attending a mosque with his father, but did not seem that interested in religion.” He said Hussain “was into guns when he was young, but has no idea how he would have obtained on(e).” Police have not said publicly where Hussain got his gun. An older brother, who remains in a coma after suffering a drug overdose, was previously arrested for possessing ammunition.
Police also interviewed Hussain’s parents. Both of their first names were redacted by the judge’s order.
His father reported his son took sleeping pills, but did not drink or do drugs. His father also said he took his son to Pakistan two or three years ago to visit family. “Faisal was happy on the trip and did not want to return because people left him alone there,” one of the ITOs says.
When Hussain left the apartment around 9 p.m., he said goodbye to his family. “Nothing seemed unusual. He was wearing a shoulder bag he always wore,” his father told police.
The father added he never saw any evidence of guns in the apartment, nor did his son have any mental health issues. One day after the shootings, the family released a statement saying Hussain had “severe mental health challenges, struggling with psychosis and depression his entire life.”
The ITOs also contain details of Hussain’s interactions with police, including an arrest for shoplifting four days before the shooting, and as a complainant in an unspecified mischief investigation. Toronto police also had three “emotional disturbed person” reports, from 2010, “believed to be the same person as the shooter in this offence.”
Hussain’s mother, contradicting her husband, told police her son had never left Canada. She also told them she had seen no change in his behaviour and that he “never talked about guns and (she had) never seen him angry.”
The ITOs also contain chilling witness accounts from the Danforth that warm summer evening. Area resident Jaspal Singh said he was walking along a laneway when a person behind him said: “Don’t worry, I’m not going to shoot you.” Singh replied sarcastically, “Thanks,” the ITO says.
He told police the male was “smiling as he was shooting.”
Toronto police dispatchers also received a call from someone who said the “shooter stood on top of a woman and shot her four times.”""" ;

The provincial government has approved disaster declarations by the Town of Blue Mountains, West Grey and Grey Highlands, which were hit by tornadoes last month.
Municipal Affairs Minister Jim Watson declared the entire affected region a disaster, making it eligible for provincial assistance, and the province will provide $2 for every dollar raised locally in disaster relief.
Although the damage figure in the three affected communities is still being added up, Warden Kevin Eccles says it has surpassed the $30-million mark.
Eccles welcomes the approval from the province, but doubts anyone will see any money within six months.
He says the three communities will have to first set up a joint disaster relief committee, which will oversee fundraising and settle claims.

Last year it was streamed live on YouTube, but today Ultra is announcing Twitch as its exclusive broadcast partner. The move highlights the growing competition between the two video platforms, which Twitch played up in its statement. "Ultra's decision to switch over to our platform validates Twitch as a legitimate force in the music space."
Twitch was acquired by Amazon back in August of 2014 for $970 million dollars and dominates the live streaming market for gaming. But over the last two years it has moved aggressively into live music, hosting a number of prominent electronic artists and launching a new broadcast category for performers. Last month Skrillex and Diplo uses BeatPort’s Twitch channel to unveil their Jack U project, a live stream that peaked at more than 20,000 concurrent viewers.
Live streaming as a form of media is having a moment. Meerkat just won the war for attention at SXSW and Twitter acquired Periscope, presumably so it could add broadcasting as an option on its platform. Sites like YouNow are allowing streamers to make a living chatting, eating, and sleeping on camera. The rise of smartphones and faster mobile networks means people can more easily tune at a moments notice.
Of course, as Twitch has professionalized, it has also cracked down on the use of unlicensed music. The company recently launched a library of free songs that can be used by broadcasters instead. You can get a feel for what live music is like on the service at 2pm eastern today, when The Prodigy premiers two new tracks.""" ;

The White Hurricane: The worst storm in Great Lakes history
Find Your Forecast Search for a location
Chris Scott
Chief Meteorologist
Monday, November 10, 2014, 9:07 PM - Over 250 lives lost. At least 12 ships sunk. Thirty other ships crippled. The worst natural disaster in Great Lakes history.
The Great Storm of 1913, known as the ‘White Hurricane’, struck the Great Lakes 101 years ago this weekend.
It was truly an epic storm that is a benchmark in Great Lakes marine and meteorological history.
The Storm
November wind storms across the Great Lakes are common, but a storm with the intensity and impact of the White Hurricane is exceptionally rare. The storm began forming on November 7, 1913, and reached its peak intensity on November 9 before it finally weakened a few days later on November 11. It generated more than 50 cm of snow in cities such as Cleveland, winds to more than 130 km/h on the open waters of Lake Huron and waves taller than a two-storey house.
Weather forecasting was still in its infancy a century ago, and the inability to accurately predict the intensity of this storm likely contributed to the high death toll on the lakes as at least a dozen ships were lost.
The White Hurricane began as an Alberta clipper-type storm system which merged with a moist Atlantic low pressure system. A large dip in the jet stream across the eastern U.S. allowed warm, moist air to be pulled northward while frigid arctic air plunged southward. The resulting contrast helped fuel a tremendous pressure gradient between the storm’s centre and a strong ridge of high pressure to the west.
The intensity of the winds, blowing in the same direction over a long period of time, resulted in wave heights on Lake Huron which have not been rivaled.
Initial forecasts before the storm struck predicted the Alberta clipper would move quickly across the Great Lakes. It was anticipated that winds would be strong from the southwest ahead of the clipper and from the northwest behind it. As a result, ships positioned themselves against the more sheltered Michigan shoreline or in the southern part of Lake Huron from Goderich, Ont., to Point Edward. However, these positions proved to be the precarious and ultimately tragic as the powerful merged storm system brought fierce northerly winds which blew down the length of the lake, generating massive waves. The fact that three of the larger ships were found upside down indicated they had capsized, suggesting very steep waves as tall as a two-storey house.
A 21st Century Take on the White Hurricane
Modern weather forecasting uses sophisticated computer models to simulate and predict the storms. A storm similar to the Great Storm of 1913 would do significant damage today, but we would be able to see it coming many days, perhaps a week, in advance.
The Detroit National Weather Service office performed a computer simulation of the White Hurricane, providing a detailed look at the winds and waves generated by the storm. Even without the multitude of modern-day observations to feed the computer model, the simulation provided a surprisingly accurate picture of the storm as compared to the original hand-drawn maps.
The Great Storm of 1913 will be remembered for its devastating impact on Great Lakes shipping. The ghastly accounts from the Lake Huron shoreline in the days following the storm are difficult to read.
Modern meteorology gives us tools that allow us to see monster storms like the White Hurricane coming days in advance. A similar storm today would be far less deadly, but just as impactful.

The festive period has seen bookings soar for chef David Coates and his team with the serving of hundreds of Christmas dinners and lunches.
During 2016 - the castle’s first full year of trading. 1176 has served tens of thousands of diners, catering for castle visitors, people attending the summer events as well as the usual lunches, afternoon teas and dinners.
And 2017 looks set to be an even busier year with eight wedding bookings, several functions plus the summer events season.
David said: “We’re really looking forward to next year.
"2016 has been a very busy year and really set the foundations for the future success of 1176 and the castle.”

<https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/36715-miroslav-skoro> dct:description """ZAGREB, June 23, 2019 - Pop singer Miroslav Škoro announced in a video message on his Facebook page on Sunday morning that he would run for President, saying that his decision was prompted by his belief that Croatia needed a stronger constitutional role for its President.
He said that the gist of his platform was forming an alliance with the people rather than maintaining the rule of political elites who make compromises away from the public eye and against the will of the people.
"I want to be a people's president and accountable only to you," Škoro said, stressing that, if elected, his first move would be to call on Parliament to change the Constitution.
If this initiative is rejected, I will suggest that the Prime Minister call a constitutional referendum, and if he turns down my proposal, I will call on citizens to collect signatures for a referendum, he said, adding that in that case he would like to see who would dare try to ignore the will of the people.
Škoro said that the President of the Republic is the only office holder who represents the entire nation and who receives his or her mandate directly from the people. "That's why the political influence of the President should be proportional to this fact," he said, adding that he does not want to be a decorative president but one that will have enough powers to implement policies for which he has been elected by the people.
These powers should include calling referenda, convening government sessions, nominating candidates for Constitutional Court judges, and a temporary veto.
He stressed that the President must have the right to call a referendum without the Prime Minister's consent.
In a jibe at the incumbent President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, Škoro said he can't promise that Croatia will be among the richest countries in the world, but that he will use all his intellectual and entrepreneurial abilities in the service of the state. Alluding to former SDP prime minister Zoran Milanovic, who is also running for the presidency, he said that Croatia is not "an accidental state" and that he will prove that it is indeed a successful project that has been jeopardised by incompetent politicians.
"I want to restore trust in the institution of the President of the Republic and I need your vote so that together we can give fresh impetus to Croatian culture and science," he said and added that if elected, he will advocate the European Union as a community of equal and sovereign nations, rather than a federation or a unitary state, and will protect the interests of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other neighbouring countries and promote closer ties between Croatia and its diaspora.
Škoro said that illegal migration and terrorism are the biggest security threats to Croatia and that Croatia must win support from European partners to defend the common border of the European Union. He said that the modernisation of the Croatian army must continue so as to deter anyone with territorial claims on Croatia or anyone that may wish to bring Croatia into a subordinate position.
Škoro called on all disillusioned voters to go to the polls and help him return government to the people. He said that Croatia today is governed by a controlled party system, with the two strongest parties rotating in power and backed by their trading partners.
He said that the political elites are completely alienated from the people and arrogant to the extent that they use all sorts of tricks to prevent referendums. "The loss of trust in the institutions of the state has assumed worrying proportions, with some even referring to Croatia as an unsuccessful project," Škoro said.
He said that "hundreds and thousands of Croatian daughters and sons" have emigrated because they had no chance here without a party membership card. "They simply didn't want to live in a country in which a spiral of hatred and intolerance is eating away its very foundations. This is not the Croatia which our ancestors dreamt of, which Dr Franjo Tuđman set out to create and which Croatian defenders fought and died for."
Škoro said that the victory in the 1991-1995 Homeland War and the unity achieved during that time must be a starting point in the development of the modern Croatian state, and that in such circumstances Croatia needs a president that will be "a tool of the people" for a decisive change.

<https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/37618-dejan-kovac> dct:description """ZAGREB, August 5, 2019 - Dejan Kovač, an economist at Princeton University, on Sunday announced his candidacy for Croatia's next president, saying that public procurement, pre-bankruptcy settlement procedures and government subsidies would be in the focus of his campaign.
Kovač's candidacy was supported by the Croatian Social-Liberal Party (HSLS).
A member of the American Economic Association and the Royal Economic Society and the first Croat to work at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs of Princeton University, Kovac said his decision to announce his candidacy on the day when the 1995 military and police operation Storm, which liberated areas held by Croatian Serb rebels, was launched, was not accidental.
"It's time Croatian politicians who have created problems stopped selling us the better past, it's time we turned to the future. Those who have caused problems will certainly not solve them, they are interested solely in keeping the status quo and their posts," Kovač said, adding that Operation Storm had shown that change required courage.
Twenty-four years after Operation Strom, patriotism should be demonstrated with work and competence rather than by holding one's hand on the heart, said Kovač, who believes that he is the candidate of productive but quiet Croatians who work and fight honestly while being trampled on daily by those with political connections.
It is time the voice of that productive Croatia was heard loud and clear, he said, noting that was joining in the presidential race because he believed it was time citizens assumed responsibility and a more active role in society.
Public procurement, pre-bankruptcy settlement and subsidies will be in the focus of his campaign.
Pre-bankruptcy settlement proceedings reveal how poorly Croatia's business and judicial systems are organised, he said, adding that Croatia was the only country that did not want to make public who received subsidies.
"Those are the three instruments for siphoning money from the state budget. That Gordian knot can be cut with one blow, and the sword is transparency through digitisation," Kovač said.

<https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/39661-democratic-socialism> dct:description """ZAGREB, November 16, 2019 - The presidential candidate of the non-parliamentary Workers Front party, Katarina Peović, on Saturday pushed for 21st century democratic socialism which, she said, warned that some tenets of socialism should be taken and that this idea was increasingly popular in the world.
Speaking to reporters in Šibenik, she said this city and the coastal region of Dalmatia had been witness to "deindustrialization and touristification" for 30 years. She said that in socialism Šibenik had a developed industry, people had permanent jobs "and now they are all reduced to tourism."
She said tourism had raised the region and the city but that one should ask what kind of jobs it offered because "salaries are lower, people have uncertain contracts, the jobs are all highly exploitative."
Peović recalled Šibenik's "history of revolution and fighting, and the modernist project that followed, when the country was industrialised in only a couple of decades." She said that "after 30 years of devastation... it's time we asked... why the entire industry has been shut down and in whose interest it is that our people can't be anything else but maids and waiters."
She said that in highly developed European countries tourism accounted for 4-5% of GDP, whereas in Croatia that was 20% and in Šibenik 50%, "which means that a bad tourism season reduces a whole city to poverty."
She said Croatia must protect its economy and industry and "pursue an autonomous policy towards Europe, because of the agreements we have signed with the European Commission and because the free market doesn't allow us on the periphery to develop."

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden holds a commanding lead in Delaware, as do his party’s candidates in the statewide races for governor, U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative.
A new University of Delaware Center for Political Communication poll shows that 54% of likely voters in Delaware say they will vote for Biden, while only 33% support President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. The Democratic candidate’s 21-point lead is well outside the survey’s margin of error.
“The poll results confirm that Biden is the heavy favorite to win his home state’s electoral votes,” said Professor Paul Brewer, Research Director of the Center for Political Communication. “Biden’s margin in Delaware is also consistent with a 7 to 8 point national lead for him.”
In Delaware, Biden leads Trump by more than a two-to-one margin among women (60% to 26%) and New Castle County voters (63% to 26%). The presidential race is much closer among men (46% to 43%), Kent County voters (41% to 44%) and Sussex County voters (40% to 44%).
Delaware Gov. John Carney holds a 29-point lead in his race for reelection. Among those polled, 55% support the Democratic incumbent, while 26% of likely voters say they’ll cast their ballot for Republican nominee Julianne Murray.
Carney has a 40-point lead among women (61% to 21%) and a 15-point lead among men (49% to 34%). He holds a three to one margin over Murray in New Castle County (63% to 20%), though the race is closer in Kent County (42% to 34%) and Sussex County (43% to 38%).
The incumbents are also far ahead in Delaware’s Congressional races. In the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Chris Coons holds a 30-point margin over Republican Lauren Witzke, 57% to 27%. In the U.S. House race, Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester leads Republican Lee Murphy by 22 points, 51% to 29%.
Coons and Blunt Rochester lead by wide margins among women (63% to 20% for Coons, 57% to 23% for Blunt Rochester) and narrower margins among men (50% to 36% for Coons, 44% to 36% for Blunt Rochester). Both Democrats dominate in New Castle County (67% to 19% for Coons, 58% to 23% for Blunt Rochester). The U.S. Senate race is more competitive in Kent County (Coons 40%, Witzke 30%) and Sussex County (Coons 43%, Witzke 45%). Blunt Rochester holds a smaller lead over Murphy in Kent County (42% to 33%) and is essentially tied with him in Sussex County (41% each).
“The big overall leads for Carney, Coons, and Blunt Rochester reinforce the First State’s status as a solidly blue state,” Brewer said. “Democrats have dominated recent statewide elections in Delaware. So far, none of this year’s Republican candidates shows signs of breaking that pattern.”
About the study
The National Agenda Opinion Project research was funded by the University of Delaware’s Center for Political Communication (CPC) with support from the College of Arts and Sciences. The study was supervised by the CPC’s Research Director, Paul Brewer, a professor in the Departments of Communication and Political Science and International Relations.
The study was fielded by Abt Associates and obtained telephone interviews with a representative sample of 976 adults living in Delaware, including 911 registered voters and 847 likely voters. A total of 327 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone and 649 were interviewed on a cell phone. Interviewing was conducted from Sept. 21-27, 2020, in English. Samples were drawn from both landline and cell phone random digit dialed (RDD) frames and a list of Delaware registered voters. Both the landline and cell phone RDD samples were provided by Dynata.
Statistical results are weighted for telephone service, sample frame, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and voter registration status by county to match the population parameters of the adult population in Delaware. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is ± 4% (the margin of sampling error is larger for results from subsamples). Overall, the response rate (AAPOR RR3) was 2% for the landline RDD sample, 3% for the cell RDD sample, 4% for landline numbers from the RV sample, and 2% for cell numbers from the RV sample.

The photographs will be featured in the exhibit at the Texas Seaport Museum, a $2.5 million project to be opened this fall by the Galveston Historical Foundation, said David Bush, spokesman for the foundation.

Photos of immigrants arriving in Galveston, aboard ships or dockside, would be of particular interest for a pending immigration exhibit, Bush said.
The photos will be used in photomurals and photo albums along with the museum's computer information on immigration.
The museum's computer database, the only one of its kind nationwide, will allow visitors to search records for ancestors who entered the U.S. through Galveston from 1846 through 1920.
Almost 100,000 names have been entered so far, Bush said during a recent interview.
'When Galveston was called the Ellis Island of the West was from 1890 to 1915. There was a movement called the Galveston Movement stemming from concern that Eastern European immigrants were not getting past the Eastern sea ports. It was thought that coming through Galveston, they would move out and settle into the Midwest,' Bush said.
Although no figures are available, Bush said the number of immigrants coming through Galveston amount to the thousands rather than the millions of immigrants that arrived in the United States through Ellis Island.
The Galveston movement was promoted by Galveston's large Jewish community at the time and was led by Rabbi Henry Cohen of Galveston, Bush said.
The datebase and immigration exhibit will premier during the museum's grand opening Oct. 26. The museum is located at Pier 21 on Galveston Island.
The museum's exhibits are not open yet but visitors can explore the decks of the 1877 iron barque Elissa, Texas' Tall Ship.
On the Elissa, new exhibits are being installed in the hold. The captain's cabin has been renovated using information that described the original cabin, Bush said.
The museum's main gallery will feature walk-through exhibits highlighting the workings of a 19th-century port. Visitors then will move to the theater for a wide-screen, multimedia presentation on the history of sail.
Meanwhile, modern tugs, shrimp boats and freighters can be seen going about their work from the museum's observation docks.NEWLN: ------
Bush said that anyone submitting photographs should include the owner's name, address and phone number along with the identities of the photographer, the people pictured, where the photo was taken and the year it was taken as well as other information of interest.
The photographs cannot be returned. All photos become the property of Galveston Historical Foundation and may be used for promotion purposes and in future exhibits.
Bush said slides and negatives cannot be used, and anyone submitting a photo to the museum relinquishes all rights to the photo.
Photographs should be submitted to Texas Seaport Museum Immigration Project, 2016 Strand, Galveston, Texas 77550.""" ;

With 100% of precincts reported, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are in a near tie in state delegates in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, according to the Iowa Democratic Party.
The complete results, which were long-delayed after Monday's caucuses, show Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, with 26.198% of delegate equivalents and Bernie Sanders with 26.128%, late Thursday evening.
The head of the national Democratic Party has already demanded the results be recanvassed. That demand, plus potential errors in the count, mean that the results may not be final and will likely be disputed.
After the final results were published by the part Thursday, the Associated Press again said it was unable to declare a winner, saying in an advisory, "there is evidence the party has not accurately tabulated some of its results, including those released late Thursday that the party reported as complete.
AP says it is unable to declare a winner in the Iowa Democratic caucuses
The Associated Press on Thursday evening announced it is unable to declare a winner in the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
“The Associated Press calls a race when there is a clear indication of a winner. Because of a tight margin between former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the irregularities in this year’s caucus process, it is not possible to determine a winner at this point," said Sally Buzbee, AP’s senior vice president and executive editor.
An advisory from the Associated Press went on to say "AP will continue to report and review the results from the Iowa Democratic Party as the party completes its tabulation, as well as the results of any potential recanvass or recount." Many news organizations rely on the Associated Press to analyze voting data to determine election winners.
Just hours before AP’s decision, Sanders declared himself the winner during a press conference in New Hampshire at his campaign headquarters.
"That screw-up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa, it has been unfair to all of the candidates and all of their supporters,” Sanders told reporters. “So what I want to do, three days late, is thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us Monday night.”
With nearly 97% precincts reporting, Sanders and Buttigieg are separated by less than one percentage point in the state delegate equivalent count, the number traditionally used to determine the winner of the caucuses. But Sanders continues to lead in raw vote totals, which he has since results started coming in Tuesday.

Perez calls for recanvass of caucus
DES MOINES — The top official of the Democratic Party said on Thursday that he wants the Iowa Democratic Party to recanvass results of its caucus results following extensive delays in reporting results and inaccurate information being released.
Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, made the request publicly on Twitter.
"Enough is enough. In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass," Perez tweeted.
The tweet is in response to delayed reporting of caucus results. The results have slowly trickled in. On Wednesday. the Iowa Democratic Party said it had reported inaccurate information.
Perez followed his tweet with another saying, "A recanvass is a review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy. The IDP will continue to report results."
According to a 21-page caucus recanvass and recount manual the Iowa Democratic Party prepared before Monday's caucus began, presidential campaigns can request a recanvass of results by sending Iowa party chair Troy Price a letter by noon Friday.
The manual does not say explicitly say that a DNC chair can request a recanvass — it only lists presidential campaigns as possible requesters.
"Requests must present credible evidence suggesting that results were misreported or erroneously counted," the manual said.
A committee will validate the requests, according to the manual, and include the cost "assessed to the candidate in order to complete the recanvass."
The manual says that the recanvass will occur in a space procured by the Iowa Democratic Party and that "the recanvass room will be open to campaign staff observers."
The recanvass will include an examination of caucus math worksheets and presidential preference cards and "inconsistencies are declared if results on official precinct or satellite forms are different from the results reported through the caucus reporting tool or by telephone," the manual said.

Sanders declares victory in Iowa
Pointing to the initial popular vote totals in Monday’s caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., declared victory in the nation’s first presidential preference contest, even as Iowa’s Democratic Party has yet to officially declare a winner.
“It has been unfair to the candidates, all of the candidates, and all of their supporters,” Sanders said of the days-long delay in getting complete results during a press conference in Manchester, New Hampshire Thursday.
“So what I want to do today,” Sanders continued, “is to thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us.”
Sanders pointed out that with 97% of precincts reporting, his campaign is leading by some 6,000 votes in the popular vote tally from the initial alignment at the caucuses.
“In other words, some 6,000 more Iowans came out on Monday night to support our candidacy than the candidacy of anyone else,” Sanders said, adding “we here in northern New England call that a victory.”
Based on current partial results, former mayor Pete Buttigieg leads by just 3 state delegate equivalents, which correlate eventually with national pledged delegates, the metric used to declare a winner in previous caucuses. And Sanders and Buttigieg are currently tied in the national delegate tally.
According to another metric released by the Iowa Democratic Party, Sanders leads by more than 2,000 in the raw vote total tied to the final caucus alignment — a metric being released publicly for the first time this year in response to criticism after the 2016 caucuses when Sanders narrowly lost in Iowa to Hillary Clinton.

Buttigieg responds to Iowa woman who pulled her support after learning he's gay
Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg knows that some people won't vote for him because he's gay, including the Iowa woman captured on video withdrawing her support for Buttigieg after learning that he's married to a man.
“What I want her to know is that I’m running to be her president too," Buttigieg said Thursday, when asked, during an appearance on ABC's The View, about the widely-viewed video.
The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor added that he wishes the woman could see that "my love is the same as her love for those that she cares about."
"But if she can’t see that...I am still, if I’m elected president, going to get up in the morning and try to make the best decisions for her and the people that she loves," he said.
The video, shot at an Iowa precinct Monday, shows a woman who had turned in her caucus card for Buttigieg saying she had no idea he's gay.
“I don’t want anybody like that in the White House,” she said. “So can I have my card back?”
The precinct captain responded that she respects the other woman’s view but suggested the caucusgoer dig deep inside and ask if Buttigieg’s sexuality really matters.
"He better read the Bible," the woman said.
Since launching his longshot campaign for the Democratic nomination, Buttigieg's standard response to the question of whether the nation is ready to elect a gay president has been: "There's only one way to find out."
Although the results in Iowa are still being tabulated, Buttigieg is locked in a very close battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the win.

After three days, still no winner declared
DES MOINES — The sun rises on the third day with no winner in the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
How is that possible? A faulty app. A clogged backup phone line. And three times the results than any prior caucus.
The standings in the race have tightened considerably as results dribbled in over the course of two days: Former mayor Pete Buttigieg leads by just 3 state delegate equivalents, which correlate with national pledged delegates, the metric used to declare a winner in previous caucuses.
But Sen. Bernie Sanders leads by more than 2,000 in the raw vote total tied to the final caucus alignment — a metric being released publicly for the first time this year in response to criticism after the 2016 caucus. Sanders lost that year by less than 1 percentage point to Hillary Clinton.
Trailing Buttigieg and Sanders are Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. There is still roughly 3 percent of precincts left to report their results; today just might be the day we find out the official winner.

ATLANTA – Georgia election officials are postponing the state’s March 24 presidential primaries until May because of fears over the coronavirus.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement Saturday that in-person early voting, which began statewide March 2, will be halted and the election will be moved to May 19, when Georgia’s other 2020 primary elections are being held.
The action followed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature of an emergency declaration that unlocked sweeping powers to fight COVID-19. In a speech Saturday, the governor renewed a call for places of worship, schools and others to consider canceling large gatherings as cases in the state rise.

As of Saturday, the virus had infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600. Georgia is reporting 66 confirmed cases, with most concentrated around metro Atlanta, and has had one death caused by the virus.
Election officials said in addition to the safety of the public, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older.

Al-Monitor
In his first public statement following the June 7 general elections that dashed his hopes of becoming Turkey's sole leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blasted the Syrian Kurds, and their nominal allies the United States, after they defeated the Islamic State (IS) in the northern Syrian town of Tell Abyad.
"Look at the West that is striking Arabs and Turkmens in Tell Abyad and regretfully placing the terrorist groups PYD [Democratic Union Party] and PKK [Kurdistan Workers Party] in their place. … How can we consider this West to be honest?" Erdogan said, referring to the air support the United States was giving to the Syrian Kurdish PYD fighting against IS.
The PKK has been waging a long-standing armed campaign for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, for which it has been designated as a terrorist group by Ankara and Washington. It is also fighting against IS in northern Syria.
Erdogan upped the ante June 27 and said Turkey would not allow any attempts to establish a Kurdish entity in northern Syria. "We will never allow a state to be established in northern Syria and in the south of our country. No matter what the cost, we will continue our struggle in this regard," Erdogan said.
He added that Turkey would allow attempts to change the region's demography, a reference to claims that the PYD is ethnically cleansing Tell Abyad, and other areas captured from IS, of Arabs and Turkmens. Erdogan's remarks were followed by a slew of reports in the media indicating that the Turkish military acting on orders from the government had prepared contingency plans to enter Syria and establish a buffer zone along the Turkish border of 100 kilometers (62 miles) long and 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) wide.
These reports cited officials who argue that this will not only meet Turkey's security requirements, but also establish a safe haven for Syrian refugees who continue to flood into Turkey. They also say it will enable Turkey to contribute more effectively to the fight against IS, thus belying claims in the Western media that Ankara is aiding such groups.
Given Erdogan's angry remarks, many believe this intervention's main purpose is to prevent Syrian Kurds from establishing a contiguous zone in the region. Turkey's buffer zone would fall between the Kurdish town of Kobani and Jarablus to its west, which the Kurds want to capture from IS.
Although it is opposed to any Kurdish entity along Turkey's borders, the Turkish military is said to be wary of being dragged by the government into a military adventure in Syria. Reports from the Chief of General Staff's office leaked to the media indicate that the top brass wants Ankara to consider the international ramifications of an engagement in a complex and multilayered conflict.
Serpil Cevikcan, a journalist for Milliyet who is in close contact with the military, has cited military sources who say they are ready to carry out any order from the government, but express concern about the diplomatic consequences. "The Chief of General Staff's office has conveyed its view that for such a directive to be successful, the political, military and diplomatic infrastructure has to be established in such a way as to allay all risks that may emerge," Cevikcan wrote in her column.
She said the military wants the matter to be discussed not just with the United States, but also with Russia and Iran and the regime in Damascus, which seems unlikely given that Ankara has burned all its bridges with the Syrian regime. It is also a foregone conclusion that Moscow and Tehran would oppose a buffer zone established by Turkey in Syria, having expressed their opposition to this in the past.
Retired Ambassador Umit Pamir, a member of the Global Relations Forum, also believes that entering Syria without approval from the United Nations, or the approval of a strong coalition of countries, is risky. He nevertheless believes that Moscow and Tehran can be convinced of the merits of such an operation if it is mounted against IS. But this requires Ankara to prioritize the fight against IS, which it has not done to date.
"Turkey has to work with an international coalition, otherwise it will result in serious complications," Pamir told Al-Monitor.
Washington, for its part, appears unenthusiastic about a step by Turkey that many believe would be against the Kurds. Asked about the buffer zone Turkey is said to be planning in Syria, Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, told reporters June 29 that Washington's position had not changed.
"The creation and enforcement of a no-fly zone or any other military enforced zone presents significant challenges. … They include military, financial, but also humanitarian challenges that we need to obviously consider in the broader context," Toner said. He added that they "don't have any ground truth" on the reported plans by Turkey. "All we've seen, frankly, are press reports," he said.
Deniz Zeyrek, a veteran journalist who works for Hurriyet, indicates that the military is also concerned about mounting an operation on the orders of a caretaker government that lost its parliamentary majority in the June 7 elections. "The armed forces say that when the government's directive is carried out there will have to be responsibility for the negative situations and risks that may emerge, and expect this to rest with the new government," Zeyrek wrote June 27.
Retired Brig. Gen. Armagan Kuloglu, a commentator on military matters, is among those who see no advantages to an operation in Syria. "Three objectives are mentioned for such an operation: to prevent IS or the PYD from gaining control of areas bordering Turkey, and to establish a safe haven for refugees. But we have multiple enemies here, and it is not clear who we are supposed to fight," Kuloglu told Al-Monitor. He also pointed to complications if international support for this operation is not obtained.
These considerations appear to have little sway on Erdogan and journalists who act as his unofficial spokesmen. Ibrahim Karagul, the editor-in-chief of Yeni Safak, who believes that the PYD is more dangerous than IS, said there is a grand design to establish a Kurdish corridor to carry oil from Kurdish northern Iraq to the Mediterranean over Syria.
"The aim is to make a lasting change to the map of the entire region and to restrict countries like Turkey that have an extraordinary power to influence developments. … If successful, this will be the biggest trap set for Turkey since the invasion of Iraq," Karagul claimed, arguing this must be prevented at all costs.
Meanwhile, there are those who say Erdogan does not have the authority to declare what amounts to a "casus belli," and point out that this authority rests with the parliament. Ibrahim Kaboglu, a professor of constitutional law, says that under the present constitution the president can only give such a directive if parliament is not sitting and there is a sudden attack on the country. "This is not the case today and so the power to give such orders rests with the Grand National Assembly," Kaboglu told daily Cumhuriyet.
The June 7 elections produced a hung parliament that is unlikely to authorize such an invasion given that opposition parties are opposed to this. Opinion polls have also shown consistently that a large portion of the Turkish public is opposed to any entanglement in Syria.
There are also those who claim that Erdogan wants an intervention in Syria to divert attention away from the Justice and Development Party's election losses and to engineer a situation suited to his political ambitions.
Such speculations aside, the National Security Council — an advisory board headed by the president and comprising the prime minister, relevant ministers and senior military officials — made a statement after it met June 29 that Turkey is not on the verge of any immediate action with regard to Syria. It merely indicated Turkey was "following developments in Syria with concern."
Given the confusing and seemingly intractable situation in Syria, this appears to be all that Ankara can do at the moment if it does not want to enter a fray from which it is unlikely to extricate itself unscarred.

RALEIGH, N.C. – Tim Kaine was in Jacksonville on Monday. Vice President Joe Biden swooped into Charlotte on Tuesday. President Barack Obama drew thousands of University of North Carolina students on Wednesday. Hillary Clinton returned Thursday for an evening rally in the state capital with Sen. Bernie Sanders and singer Pharrell Williams. On Friday, Obama was due back for a second time this week, making two more stops. And Saturday is Chelsea Clinton's turn in the Tar Heel State.
There's a reason North Carolina is attracting such an enormous amount of sustained attention from Democrats during the final throes of the 2016 presidential race: It's become the Clinton firewall.
Carrying 15 electoral votes, the state is less valuable than the perennial White House battlegrounds of Florida and Ohio. But there's a cold hard truth embedded in the electoral math for Republican nominee Donald Trump. Clinton can lose Florida and even drop Ohio, and still wrangle the 270 electoral votes necessary to clinch the presidency. All she needs to do is convert North Carolina to a Tar Heel-hued blue, and it's lights out for Trump.
"If Hillary wins North Carolina, she wins," Obama stated plainly during a Chapel Hill rally on Wednesday. "And that means when I said, 'The fate of the republic rests on you,' I wasn't joking."
The state of the state's polling has been paradoxical.
In the last week, different surveys have found Trump with as high a lead as 7 points and Clinton up by as many as 3 points. But political officials on both sides here are anticipating a finish that's even tighter.
"It's going to be very close," says Patsy Keever, chairwoman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. "And the pressure is on."
North Carolina solidified its battleground status over the past two presidential cycles. In 2008, Obama carried it over Sen. John McCain by 13,692 votes, or just "two votes per precinct," as the president and first lady Michelle Obama have reminded audiences. In 2012, it was just one of two states to swing back to the Republican column, with Mitt Romney outpacing the president by 97,465 votes, good enough for a 2-point win.
But this year, the state has become the center of the political map in the waning days of an increasingly competitive election, in which Trump is nipping at Clinton's heels across the country but has yet to put her away here. It's been 60 years since a Republican nominee for president has lost North Carolina and won the White House.
At this late moment though, the numbers that matter most are the tallies for early voting, which ends on Saturday at 1 p.m.
More than 2.6 million ballots have already been cast, with Democrats holding a 10-point edge on early returns. But Republicans are 12.5 percent ahead of their early voting pace from four years ago, when they overcame their initial deficit on Election Day to win.
An undeniable concern for Democrats is lagging turnout among African-Americans. Their vote is down about 11 percent from their same-day totals in 2012, according to Catawba College professor Michael Bitzer, who is tracking the numbers on his blog, Old North State Politics.
This is why the Clinton campaign has dispatched Obama to the state for three stops in the last three days.
"Don't just sit there and complain. Don't just sit there in the barber shop and the beauty shop, watching the Tar Heels and say, 'Ah, ya know, politics is all messed up, but what's the score?' No, no, no! You can watch the game after you vote," an impassioned Obama told the crowd in Chapel Hill on Wednesday.
Deborah Gilmore, a 66-year-old African-American woman from Chapel Hill, is supporting Clinton, but says it's understandable that black turnout would slide somewhat without an African-American leading the ticket. Ahead of Obama's rally for Clinton on the University of North Carolina campus, she chose to purchase an Obama hat over Clinton paraphernalia.
"I'm gonna miss him. I love seeing him on TV. I love seeing him anywhere. I try not to miss any of his speeches, any time," she says. "It'll help her."
Another variable is the surge in independents turning in early ballots.
"Unaffiliated voters are 44 percent ahead of their 2012 same-day totals," Bitzer says. "I think this is the true wild card in this election and have no idea how to read it."
The Trump campaign is keenly aware of the importance of North Carolina to its path as well. The GOP nominee made two stops in the state on Thursday, including one in Selma that was dedicated to military and law enforcement figures.
"They're so much more brave than me," Trump said, standing before a slate of veterans onstage behind him. "I'm brave in other ways, I'm financially brave. Big deal, right? These are real brave."
But Trump also stayed focused on skewering Clinton's credibility, highlighting the continuing questions and review regarding her use of a private email server.
"What's going on is a disgrace. We know now with almost 100 percent confidence that at least five foreign intelligence services breached the Clinton server and she tried to destroy the evidence by deleting the emails after – not before, that was bad – after receiving a United States congressional subpoena," Trump said, appearing to reference a source-based Fox News report and repeating a nuanced claim about Clinton's deleted emails.
Among the Trump-supporting crowd of 15,000, the bitter antipathy for Clinton was nearly universal.
"I don't want a criminal running my country. Sorry, it's harsh," says Alice Batten, a Trump supporter from Smithfield.
"If more is exposed this week, I'm hoping that the Clinton supporters will just stay home and be disgusted," says Joan Hall, of Cary.
"What has she done? F---ing lie, cheat and steal just like her husband did," says Goldsboro resident Andrew Young.
The tension engendered by the two polarizing candidates was felt even in a routine interview with Keever, the head of the state Democratic Party.
When U.S. News asked Keever inside the party's Raleigh headquarters how she thought the email controversy would impact turnout for Clinton, an aide interrupted to compare the Trump campaign's tactics to an approach that's been attributed to Nazi Germany.
"Are you familiar with the concept of 'The Big Lie'? It was a Hitler propaganda technique where you take your biggest weakness and you tell a lie so outrageous that it makes people believe the opposite of what is true," says Dave Miranda, the state party's communications director, who sat in on the interview.
"It's a situation where Republicans and the Trump campaign are using you in the media to float these ideas and muddy the waters and make these false equivalencies. I'd like you guys to do a better job."
Keever assessed that Democrats had moved on from the email saga to pick the most qualified person to be commander in chief.
"We're OK with it. It's done. We've gotten over it. We don't like it necessarily. It could've been done better, but it's not going to make us any less supportive of Secretary Clinton," she says.
Democrats have a shot at simultaneously sweeping the state's top three races: for president, governor and U.S. Senate. It's a feat Keever says would qualify North Carolina as a blue state, and a goal that national Democrats see as tantalizingly within reach.
The Trump campaign will continue a vigorous push against that trend with rallies throughout the weekend. On Friday, GOP running mate Mike Pence was slated to hit Greenville. Trump himself will be in Wilmington on Saturday and in Raleigh again Monday, on election eve.

President Donald Trump
President Donald Trump has a shockingly low ceiling of support in Republican-dominated Utah as he runs for re-election in 2020 according to a new Utah Political Trends survey from UtahPolicy.com and Y2 Analytics.
Trump carried Utah in 2016 with just 45.5% of the vote. That lack of majority support was primarily due to the presence of independent candidate Evan McMullen on the ballot. McMullen pulled 21.5% of voters that year. Our new survey suggests Utah voters are again pining for an alternative to Trump and whoever the Democrats end up nominating this year.
It is almost inconceivable that Trump will fail to carry Utah in 2020. However, his unpopularity, coupled with the state’s traditional hostility to Democratic candidates, could leave an opening for a third-party or independent candidate to capture a significant amount of the vote next year.
For this survey, our panel was asked to decide a hypothetical head to head matchup between Trump and some of the leading Democratic presidential hopefuls. The Democratic candidates were assigned randomly to our panelists, and not every panelist was presented with all of the pairings.
The survey found Trump’s average level of support in each of the hypothetical matchups was 40%, while the Democratic candidate averaged 35%. 15% said they would support a third-party candidate. 5% told us they would vote for a candidate not listed in our choices, while 6% had no opinion.
The 40% average support for Trump mirrors his 2016 vote total, while the 35% average is close to the traditional ceiling of support for a statewide Democratic candidate.
Trump’s support flagged in some individual head-to-head matchups with some of the leading Democratic candidates:
Trump trailed New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker 43-31%
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led Trump by 6-points (44-38%), which is a statistical tie given the larger margin of error.
Trump ran almost even against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 39-36%. He was also tied with former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump had a statistically significant lead over California Sen. Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke.
Kelly Patterson of Y2 Analytics says Trump’s struggles against some of the Democratic hopefuls is a function of how well known those opponents are to voters.
“Preferences for the Democratic candidates are not well-formed and grounded,” he said. “This is especially true in a state where there are not many Democrats and nobody knows who the nominee will be and they don’t know much about the candidates. You can see this by people peeling off and choosing a third-party candidate, which is a ‘catchall’ category for individuals who may not like the choices or who may know little right now about the candidates.”
Patterson says the numbers show Utah voters continue to be uneasy supporting Trump.
“Trump’s vote does not appear to go very high in a state where Republicans hold a large majority,” he said. “Trump not only has a low ceiling of support, but his performance depends, as you might expect, on the opponent he faces.”
Trump’s unpopularity in the 4th District continues as his average support against the Democratic candidates is just 36%, while Democrats average 41% support, which would be a statistical tie given the larger margin of error due to smaller sample sizes. Trump carried this district with 39% in 2016. The numbers from our current survey suggest that level of support has not changed much, with Trump not expanding his level of support beyond his current base of supporters.
Trump also struggles in the 2nd Congressional District, averaging just 37% support, while the Democratic field averaged 42%. Again, that suggests a statistical tie because of the larger margin of error. However, it is significant that Trump’s popularity is seemingly waning given the fervent support from Rep. Chris Stewart who is one of Trump’s most enthusiastic backers in Congress. Trump got 46% in UT02 in the 2016 election.
There is a significant gender gap between men and women in support for Trump. In our hypothetical matchups, Trump averaged 45% support from men, but just 33% support from women.
The Utah Political Trends Survey was conducted by Y2 Analytics among 1,017 registered Utah voters from July 31-August 6, 2019. More information about the polling methodology is available here. You can read more about how our panelists are selected here.""" ;

<https://www.vote411.org/colorado> dct:description """The voting machine systems used in Colorado are optical scan, DRE and hand-counted paper ballots.
Optical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.
Direct Recording Electronic (DRE): This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.
There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.
Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.
You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.
Paper Ballots: Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.
You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource or through Verified Voting.""" ;

The Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller may have contributed much to medieval Wales, but the impact of the Princes of Deheubarth on the period should not be underestimated either, writes Dr Roger Turvey
WELSH history is not without its tyrants, warmongers and sexual predators but the names of princes like Anarawd, Cynwrig, Maelgwn and Maredudd do not trip off the tongue so easily.
The Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller in Wales are shrouded in mystery but the evidence of princely existence, although also not well known, is all around us in the shape of stone ruins, earthen mounds and, even, place names such as Maes Gwenllian in Kidwelly.
It does not take a great deal of effort to visit these sites – for example, the castles of Carreg Cennen, Dinefwr and Dryslwyn lie within a 10-mile radius of each other – and those who do usually come away impressed and enlightened.
The greatest architectural legacy of medieval Wales is its castles and it is in their design and construction that the influence of the princes was most keenly felt. By the early 12th century the castle had become the predominant instrument of conquest, consolidation and defence.
As a medieval historian born and bred almost within sight of Carreg Cennen Castle, for me the princes of Deheubarth would, almost inevitably, figure in my primary list of interests.
This is, after all, Lord Rhys country.
Rhys ap Gruffudd, known to history as the Lord Rhys, was a Carmarthen- shire-born prince who may be regarded as one, if not the most important, of the rulers of pre-conquest Wales.
Credited with hosting the first eisteddfod at Cardigan in 1176, Rhys ap Gruffudd was more than simply a warrior and political leader, he was also a patron of the arts and religious benefactor.
The Lord Rhys and his descendants are probably to be counted among the most liberal and cosmopolitan benefactors of their day, patronising no less than four different orders of monks, Benedictine (Cardigan, Llandovery), Cistercian (Strata Florida, Whitland), Premonstratensian (Talley) and the Knights Hospitaller (Slebech), along with a nunnery at Llanllyr.
Though not the first to erect native castles, the Lord Rhys was foremost among the more powerful princes to grasp the wider strategic significance of castle building in pursuit of political as well as military objectives.
Having secured his borders by 1171, Rhys turned to affirming his power from within by building a series of stone castles in each of the constituent lordships or cantrefi that made up Deheubarth.
The chroniclers make much of the fact that in the summer of 1171 Rhys “built with stone and mortar the castle of Cardigan”, a stronghold which, thereafter, became his chief royal residence.
There are good grounds for believing that sometime between 1172 and 1194 he was responsible for the construction of a further six stone castles – Cilgerran, Dinefwr, Llandovery, Nevern, Rhayader and Ystradmeurig – all of which formed part of a broader pattern of land control.
The adoption of stone for building became considerably more widespread so that by the beginning of the 13th century Deheubarth glittered with lime-washed castles and monasteries.
This led to a corresponding upsurge in interest in “the mother of the arts” namely architecture which, together with the creative application of sculptural decoration, earned for the Welsh builders of the period a distinctive style known today as Celtic Romanesque.
The most striking example of this decorative style is to be found at the Cistercian monastery of Strata Florida. The archway of the great west door still survives symbolising its position at the summit of native church architecture and cementing its prestige as an important medieval centre of Welsh culture and learning. A new visitor centre will be opened next month by Cadw at this unique ruin in Mid Wales.
Today Deheubarth exists only in the mind and on the printed page but its legacy is there still to be discovered and enjoyed.
Dr Roger Turvey is a biographer of the Lord Rhys and has published widely on medieval and early modern Welsh history.""" ;

THAT most Welsh of institutions - the eisteddfod - may have its origins in an obscure French festival, according to historians.
For centuries the eisteddfod has been seen as much part of our nation's cultural life as the Welsh language, coracles and cawl.
But according to a forthcoming S4C programme, its roots go all the way back to a 12th century poetry and music festival called the Puy.
Historian Roger Turvey, of Dinefwr, West Wales, has examined the theory that the first known Welsh eisteddfod, held by Rhys ap Gruffudd, known as The Lord Rhys, at Cardigan Castle in 1176, owes much to his well-documented French connections.
Dr Turvey said, "It was because The Lord Rhys had such a cosmopolitan outlook that this theory has been offered.
"He had a close connection with the Norman French and borrowed a number of their traditions. It is known that he did hold Welsh cultural festivals and that there may well have been one in 1176, possibly to celebrate the completion of Cardigan Castle.
"There is very little written information about The Lord Rhys' personal life, but he did invite outside influences.
"It is known that there was a French cultural festival called The Puy, which he may or may not have imitated."
The Lord Rhys (1132-1197), who will have an episode of the series Tywysogion (Princes) devoted to him later this month, has long been regarded as the founder of the eisteddfodic tradition. He is also revered for almost single-handedly resurrecting the princedom of Deheubarth in South Wales.
His French links include being the first Welsh prince to be officially recognised and bestowed a title by a "French king" - in the guise of one on the Norman rulers on the English throne at the time, Henry II.
The Puy festival is said to share uncanny similarities with the Welsh Eisteddfod in featuring poetry and music competitions.
But despite the debate surrounding the eisteddfod's roots, the National Eisteddfod we know today with its druidic pomp and ceremony owes more to the imagination of 18th century poet and master-forger Iolo Morganwg than any of the festival's previous incarnations.
Buried in St David's Cathedral, The Lord Rhys's lasting legacy has been somewhat diminished over the past eight centuries largely because he fathered 17 children, leading to a squabble over his inheritance that weakened the principality he had worked so hard to build.
Nevertheless Philip James, an area manager for the National Trust, said there were plans to preserve his memory.
He said, "Plans are in hand to start to reveal for visitors to Dinefwr Park and Castle some of the exciting stories around The Lord Rhys, including his links with what we now know as the National Eisteddfod, as well as his keen interest in herbal medicine and Welsh law."
Hywel Teifi Edwards, an authority on the eisteddfod, said he was not surprised by the suggested links between the eisteddfod and earlier festivals.
"It's conjecture, but there's no doubt that there was a bardic tradition of competition for status before this time," he said.
He added that the "first eisteddfod" may well have attracted entrants from as far afield as France, while it was very possible that The Lord Rhys was aware of the Puy festivals from soldiers returning from campaigns on mainland Europe.
And, far from diminishing the unique Welshness of the eisteddfod, Mr Edwards said any foreign influence was an indication of Wales' cosmopolitanism at the time.
"It's a sign of a healthy culture to accept - and marry with - other cultures," he added.

A nine foot sculpture of Wales’ first ever National Eisteddfod chair has been installed at Cardigan Castle – the site of Wales’ first ever cultural festival.
The regenerated historical site will open its doors to the public on April 15, exactly 12 years after it came into public ownership.
After more than a decade of lobbying and fundraising, led by the Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust (CBPT) and its devoted volunteers, the 900-year-old site has undergone a £12m restoration project, which began in 2011.
On Wednesday the final piece of its transformation was fixed in place at the site of Wales’ first Eisteddfod, which took place in 1176.
Rich history
Central to the “chairing of the bard” tradition, which to this day remains a feature of the modern Eisteddfod, the huge throne has been carefully manoeuvred by a team of labourers into position atop the East Tower, where it will provide visitors with a unique picture opportunity.
The castle was built in the 12th century by the Norman Gilbert de Clare, and passed to his son.
It was captured by Rhys ap Gruffydd in 1136 and passed back and forth between Welsh and Norman hands over the next century.
It was claimed by Edward I at the end of the 13th century, suffered damage during the English Civil War and lay uninhabited until the early 19th century when a private property was built on site.
'The flagship artefact'
A spokesman for the project said: “The hand-carved structure – made from local oak, slate and bronze – was sculpted by Cardigan-based woodcarving artist Paul Clarke and marks one of the final pieces of the £12m Cardigan Castle restoration project.
“It includes a number of interpretive details, from a carved lion’s head based on the Dinefwr coat of arms, to two bronze horses, which are representative of Lord Rhys’ own interest in equestrianism; he is believed to have once given King Henry II a number of horses from his own prized collection as a peace offering.
“Visitors will be able to see the chair for the first time when the Castle opens its doors to the public on April 15, following an extensive restoration project.
“It will become the flagship artefact of the world’s first and only exhibition on the story of the Eisteddfod, which will reveal the history of the iconic cultural festival and its relationship to Cardigan through words, visual displays, poetry and music.”
Eisteddfod exhibition
Other artefacts set to feature in the exhibition include the 1967 National Eisteddfod crown, which was presented to that year’s crowned Bard, Eluned Phillips, the only woman to have won two crowns at the National Eisteddfod, as well as tickets, programmes and posters from Eisteddfods dating back to the 19th century.

Historian Glen Johnson, who has spent 30 years studying the site’s unique heritage, welcomed the return of this Eisteddfod Chair to the festival’s birthplace.
'One step closer'
He said: “The chair is the ultimate symbol of Wales’ beloved Eisteddfod tradition, and I can think of no better place for this sculpture to reside than at Cardigan Castle. “It was here that the original Eisteddfod was held in 1176, when poets and musicians from across the country gathered to compete for a place on the original seat, which was stationed at Lord Rhys’ table.
“A huge amount of work and expert craftsmanship went into the finished piece, and it shows.
“The historical details, from the Dinefwr lion to the Medieval court dog that rests beneath it, are magnificent. Lord Rhys would be proud.”
Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: “We’re elated to welcome the chair home to Cardigan Castle, where it can be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.
“The impending opening marks the first time the site’s fascinating past will be accessible to the public, and the chair’s arrival means we’re one step closer to being able to show the world the part Cardigan and its 900-year old castle played in the dawn of Welsh culture.”""" ;

He had a stroke in December that paralyzed the right side of his body, and he lapsed into a coma last week.
He became prime minister of Sierra Leone in 1968 after a military coup and assumed the presidency on April 21, 1971, two days after Sierra Leone became a republic. He retired as president in November 1985.
At the 1985 conference of the All Peoples Congress Party, he persuaded other presidential hopefuls to stand down in favor of Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh, a 48-year-old soldier. Momoh's election as party leader was seen as a triumph for Mr. Stevens.
On a continent where leaders normally hold power for life or until ousted by force, Mr. Stevens was only the fourth black African head of state to retire from office. President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, who led his West African nation to independence from France in 1960, resigned in 1981. Amadou Ahidjo resigned as president of Cameroon in 1982 after governing for the first 22 years of independence. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania retired as president in 1985, just days ahead of Stevens, after 24 years in office.
Momoh took over in November 1985 in a rare smooth transfer of power but in March 1987 faced an unsuccessful coup attempt involving Vice President Francis Minah. Mr. Stevens was briefly put under house arrest but denied any involvement in the plot. Minah and 15 other people were sentenced to death but have not been executed pending appeals before the nation's high court.
During his presidency, Mr. Stevens worked to bolster Sierra Leone's image abroad, cultivating good relations with neighbors Guinea and Liberia and serving as chairman of the Organization of African Unity from June 1980 to July 1981.
At home, financial problems, worsened by corruption, forced Mr. Stevens to adopt austere economic policies, which he termed "political suicide," that were recommended by the International Monetary Fund.
Minerals, principally diamonds, account for more than half of the nation's exports. But, with diamond smuggling endemic, foreign exchange earnings were badly hit. At the same time, import costs, particularly for oil, rose sharply, causing balance of payments problems and budget deficits.
In foreign affairs, Mr. Stevens was a critic of South Africa's apartheid. He established diplomatic relations with China, North Korea, Cuba and other communist countries. He also gave financial backing to African liberation movements while pursuing a moderate, pro-Western policy.
Mr. Stevens was born at Tolobu, in the southern Moyamba district, on Aug. 24, 1905. He joined the colonial police force in 1923. Seven years later, he joined the Sierra Leone Development Company, a subsidiary of the British firm William Baird, which then had a monopoly in the country's iron resources.
Concerned over African miners' working conditions, Mr. Stevens organized the United Mine Workers' Union in 1943 and became its first secretary-general. He was a local councilor and was appointed as a workers representative in Sierra Leone's protectorate assembly set up in 1945.
In 1953, he became minister of Lands, Mines and Labor but lost his assembly seat in the 1957 general election. He was expelled from the People's National Party and set up his own party, the All Peoples Congress.
In the first post-independence elections in 1962, Mr. Stevens, a persuasive speaker, became opposition leader in parliament. Elected to the influential post of Freetown mayor in 1964, he led the All Peoples Congress to a convincing win in the 1967 election.
He was appointed prime minister but almost immediately was put under house arrest by the then army chief, Brig. David Lansana, who declared martial law. He returned as prime minister in April 1968. His early administration was plagued by violence. In 1971, there were two unsuccessful assassination attempts against him. The same year Sierra Leone became a republic and Stevens its president.
In 1978 parliament passed a bill allowing one-party rule, later supported by a referendum. In June 1978, Stevens was sworn in for seven years under the new system. He once said: "Like the United Nations, I have achieved quite a lot in staying alive.\"""" ;

Michel Aoun declared the Lebanese parliament dissolved early today after deputies assembled in Paris announced their intention to go ahead with presidential elections. \"According to constitutional decree 240, the parliament is dissolved,\" Aoun said in a statement at 5 a.m. local time, following reports that about 24 legislators would fulfill their pledge to elect a new president. The deputies had been debating whether to return to Beirut for the session scheduled for today. Aoun said parliamentary elections would be held in January, in keeping with the constitutional requirement that the president dissolve parliament only if he can organize such an election within three months. The 53-year-old general is the head of a Christian military cabinet appointed last year when deputies failed to elect a successor to former president Amin Gemayel. On Friday, Aoun had threatened to take the drastic step to dissolve the 99-seat legislature if there were any indications that elections set for today would go ahead as planned. There are 73 surviving deputies and a quorum of 49 is required for a two-thirds majority, according to the current constitution. Aoun had urged deputies to come and face the nation before proceeding with a planned session that would endorse a newly drawn national reconciliation charter and elect a new house speaker and president. After Aoun's warning Friday, bombs exploded outside the homes and offices of three Christian Lebanese deputies in Christian areas controlled by the general. Plans for massive demonstrations by Aoun's supporters prompted Arab League envoy Lakhdar Librahimi to announce that the voting for president would be moved from the parliament building to an undisclosed location. Dozens of police surrounded a seaside hotel where deputies were expected to assemble. A number of Moslem and Christian deputies arrived in West Beirut on the eve of the planned election, but the 24 Christian deputies meeting in Paris were looked on as key. The scheduled election was a result of an Arab League-sponsored agreement reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia, last month among rival Christian and Moslem Lebanese legislators for a new national charter for Lebanon that would reduce the political powers of the dominant Christian minority. Lebanon has had no effective central government since civil war began in 1975, and has had no head of state since Gemayel's term ended in September 1988. Gemayel declared Aoun caretaker prime minister, but Moslems insist Selim Hoss is the legitimate premier. Aoun has said he opposed the Taif document because it did not call for a timetable for the withdrawal of the 40,000 troops that Syria has deployed in much of Lebanon. Moslem deputies argued that Syria should maintain a position in Lebanon until Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon. \"Before the session is held, and at the first sign that it will take place, parliament will be dissolved,\" Aoun said at a press conference Friday. Aoun also accused the deputies who have not returned to Lebanon of being guilt-ridden for having approved the charter during the Saudia Arabia talks." ;

Behind the barber’s chair where Claude Rasnake diagnoses many of the world’s problems, he charted the to-do list of the Trump administration.
Social Security, Medicare, the tax code — maybe Trump and a Republican Congress can finally get them fixed. Dismantle Obamacare and fix roads and bridges, too. But all that comes later, after the top priority.
“The first thing I’d like him to do is fire that lady that runs the EPA,” Rasnake, 81, said, working the trimmer around a customer’s ear. The Environmental Protection Agency makes regulations that limit the use of coal, and here that kills jobs.
Rasnake had pondered his vote for months. He didn’t like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton — didn’t like the insults and the lies. But about a week ago he made up his mind, and it came down to this: Clinton had promised to put coal companies out of business and Trump donned a miner’s helmet and said he would help the dying industry.
[McConnell says it’s ‘hard to tell’ if President Trump will bring back coal jobs]
“That was the basis of our economy here,” Rasnake said, as his customer began to grunt in agreement. “That’s really hurt. I’ve lost customers — some have had to move away. The one’s that are left have a hard time getting by, month to month.”

This part of Virginia, the far Southwest, is almost as distant from Washington as Boston is. These are the red-state voters who went overwhelmingly for Trump but were canceled out by blue Northern Virginia. But while the Washington suburbs helped Clinton take Virginia’s 13 electoral votes, the people of these hard-hit hamlets and towns woke up Wednesday to find that their man had actually won the presidency.
“I was elated. I was super surprised,” said Roy Bonney, 49, who owns Red Oak Trading Co., a hardware and home improvement store in Coeburn. He had thought Trump shot his mouth off too much to get elected. Many voters here said the same, that they were unhappy with the way Trump talked and conducted himself.
But they voted for him by a huge margin. Russell County, where Lebanon is located, went 78 percent for Trump, 19 percent for Clinton. Wise County, where Coeburn is located, was 80 percent Trump. Dickenson, Tazewell, Lee, Scott and Buchanan counties — coal country — were all the same. Many areas went more heavily for Trump than they did for Mitt Romney four years ago.

Unemployment in these counties runs roughly twice the statewide rate of 4 percent. Most of the job losses are from mining and related industries. Virginia coal production last year dropped 70 percent from its peak, in 1990, and is declining every year.
The growth jobs are in retail, food services, health care and social assistance, according to data from the Virginia Employment Commission. A lot of the work is part time.
“We’ve had a lot of factories closing down. Families have lost jobs,” said Linda Smith, 39, who works part time at the Food City grocery store in Lebanon and can’t afford health insurance, even under the Affordable Care Act. Her husband, who once worked in mining, is disabled from a car accident. “Men don’t know how to do nothing at all except work in the coal mines. . . . If [Trump] can get some of that opened back up, people will be happy.”
In Wise County, Juan Lopez, 42, climbs down off the huge mining truck he’s been repairing, hands blackened with grease. He came to the United States in 1991 from Mexico, got married, got his citizenship, had two children. “We go to church,” he said. “We’re trying to do it right.”
Lopez voted for Trump. It was a vote to keep his job. “They say if Trump can do it better [with the coal industry], we might be able to have jobs two or three more years,” he said. “But if not, we might be out by the end of next year.”

Lopez’s employer, Ricky Meade, owns a vast fleet of trucks for hauling or loading coal — yellow and red Peterbilt and Kenworth rigs with 35-foot trailers, about 70 of them sitting idle behind a chain-link fence bearing Trump/Pence signs.
“We went from running 85 trucks to running eight trucks, over the past three or four years,” said Meade, 47. He grew up here, but now lives an hour’s drive away in Bristol, Tenn., so his daughters can have more opportunities. His customer base is down to a single mine. From 105 employees, he now has about 25.
He’s had to hire a man to do nothing but start up trucks and move them around, so they can stay in working condition.
The whole area, he said, is literally built on coal. All the commercial buildings are on sites that had been leveled by mining. All the jobs are connected. “Everything you see, everything we got came in some way from coal. If it wasn’t for coal this part of Virginia wouldn’t exist.”

Meade stayed up long past midnight Tuesday, watching election returns. Then he couldn’t sleep and turned them on again. He never thought Trump would win, and didn’t much like him. “He was the lesser of two evils, but he was our only hope,” he said. “With Hillary I don’t know that we would survive.”
Now he wants to see if Trump will deliver on what he promised. If he lowers restrictions on power plants, then use of steam coal may go up and some miners may go back to work. “I know he can’t wave a magic wand. I know we can’t get back to where we were two or three years ago,” he said. “I hope we can get back at least part of it.”
That alone is a tall order. Coal is simply on the wane worldwide as climate change becomes more of a concern, natural gas remains cheap and alternate forms of energy become more cost-effective. U.S. coal consumption dropped 13 percent last year.
Back at Rasnake’s barber shop, where he keeps his guitar in a chair because “a lotta barbers play music, especially up here in these mountains,” hope is barely hanging on. “If we’re going to have any jobs here it’s going to have to be the coal companies. This little town is just drying up,” said Kenneth Jessee, 67, who retired from a coal company three years ago to farm.
As Rasnake talked about his decision to vote for Trump, the man getting a haircut finally spoke up at the question of whether Trump can make a difference.
“No, he can’t,” said William Sisk, 78, of Buchanan County. “You won’t see those people working in the coal industry no more. Natural gas is too cheap. Any kind of market for coal anymore is very weak.”

Sisk spent 30 years at Pittston Coal, he said, as Rasnake finished and whipped the cover off him. “I made a good living at it, got a good retirement. But it’s gone,” he said, referring to the industry, but also Pittston, which sold out years ago after a crippling strike.
“It was the life’s blood here,” Rasnake agreed.
“A lot of people talk about [President] Obama’s war on coal,” Sisk said, standing and getting his cap. “But the coal war was on long before Obama got there. The bottom dropped plum out when he got in there and he got all the blame for it. But I don’t think it’s ever going to come back.”
As Sisk stepped out into the sunlight, he confessed that he didn’t vote for Trump. “He’s too radical. He promised too much,” he said. “You can promise anything, but you got to deliver.”
Sisk didn’t vote at all.""" ;

Only once has a Democrat been elected to the presidency without carrying Maryland. That was the 1948 election, in which Maryland mirrored most of the rest of the Republican northeast in backing Thomas Dewey's candidacy for the GOP. (Despite what you may have read in the newspapers, Dewey lost.)
In 2016, Maryland will be a lot easier for Hillary Clinton to win (she leads by more than 30 points, according to RealClearPolitics) than Ohio will be for Donald Trump (he trails by 3).
It also seems unlikely that Trump will reel in a number of the other top states that Republicans have relied upon in the past. New Hampshire? Maybe. Vermont? No. Illinois? Never.
For all of the time we spend considering the red and blue states in the presidential election process, it's easy to forget how recently those designations arose. Georgia is one of the states that has least consistently voted for a winning Republican -- because it, like the rest of the Deep South, was heavily Democratic until after the passage of the Civil Rights Act.
The tricky state on Hillary Clinton's list is Florida. Only twice has a Democrat won the presidency without winning Florida, in 1960 (John Kennedy) and 1992 (a guy named Bill Clinton).
In total, the winner of the presidency has won Florida in 26 of the 38 elections since 1860. That's toward the middle of the pack, as far as it goes. The states that have most often voted for the winner of the presidency are:
Ohio, 34 of 38 times Illinois, 33 California, 31 Nevada, 31 New Hampshire, 31 New York, 30 Wisconsin, 30
Clinton will certainly win at least three of those states and is currently leading in the other four.
The state that's least important for winning the presidency, regardless of party? Setting aside Alaska and Hawaii (which are still little baby states, relative to U.S. history), it's Mississippi. More than half the time, the winner of Mississippi (and Georgia, Alabama and South Dakota) hasn't won the presidency. Three of those states, Trump will win; only Georgia is a question mark.
The standard caveat applies: A pool of 38 elections isn't enough to make declarative statements about what will and won't happen. I feel comfortable saying that if Hillary Clinton loses Maryland, she won't win the presidency. If Donald Trump loses Ohio but wins Florida and Pennsylvania (for example), he could still win.""" ;

Miles, 61; his wife, Cynda, 58; their daughter, Katrina, 35; and Katrina’s four children — Taye, 13, Rylan, 12, Ayre, 10, and Kayden, 8 — were found dead with gunshot wounds early Friday morning at a home in Osmington, a rural town nestled in Australia’s southwest corner. Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson did not explicitly say that Peter Miles killed his family before shooting himself. But he told reporters Saturday that only six of the seven family members were victims of a homicide, and police don’t believe any other person was involved.

Dawson also said police received an emergency call at 5:15 a.m. Friday. He said a man had made the call from the family’s property, but Dawson declined to elaborate further. Three guns — all registered to Peter Miles — were found at the house.
One of the deceased was found outside the house. Another, a woman, was found inside. The other five, a woman and the children, were found in a converted shed structure, Dawson said.
The deaths shocked Osmington, a community of only 135 people, and the nearby town of Margaret River, one of Western Australia’s surfing hot spots. Local officials said the Miles family was deeply connected to the community.
Cockman, who had been estranged from Katrina Miles for reasons that are unclear, said he saw his children during supervised visits. He told reporters that he’d spent years angry at Peter and Cynda Miles for cutting him off from his children.

AD
“The anger towards them now is completely gone, completely gone. I don’t feel angry. I feel tremendous sadness for my kids. I don’t want anyone to feel angry,” he said.
Cockman said he used to get along well with Peter Miles, and he loved “who Peter was,” according to 9 News Australia. If it had not been for Peter Miles, he said, he wouldn’t have had his children.
“So it’s not some random guy off the street who’s taken them away from me. He gave them to me and now he’s taken them away,” the father said.
Cockman said he takes solace in knowing that his children died “peacefully in their beds.” He said he asked one of the investigators whether his youngest son, Kayden, was in the same bed as his mother when he died. The boy liked to sleep next to his mother, Cockman said.
AD
“I was told, ‘Yes, he was in Kat’s bed. They all looked peaceful,’ ” Cockman told reporters.
AD
The deadly incident was Australia’s worst mass shooting since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman opened fire in a cafe in Tasmania and then hunted down more victims in his vehicle, killing 35 and injuring many.
Soon after the 1996 incident, John Howard, who was elected as Australia’s prime minister that year, enacted strict gun control. Known as the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA), the law banned the possession, manufacture and sale of all semiautomatic firearms and pump-action shotguns other than in “exceptional circumstances,” such as military and police use.
AD
The NFA, one of the most stringent gun laws in the world, also mandated that applicants wait 28 days from the time they obtain a permit to the time they buy a weapon. Applicants are also required to undergo firearms training, and weapons and ammunition must be stored separately, according to the law.
AD
In 2016, a research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that Australia had not had a mass shooting since the changes and that suicide rates in the country had been on the decline, The Post’s Christopher Ingraham reported. Ingraham noted, however, that there were no significant changes in gun-related homicides.
A 2016 investigation by the Age, an Australian newspaper, found that gun-related crimes in Melbourne had doubled over the past five years.
Mark McGowan, the premier of Western Australia, called the deaths of the seven people “one of the worst tragedies” that part of the country has been confronted with.
AD
“Words cannot mend or heal a loss of such magnitude; nonetheless, I must express my most sincere commiserations to the family and the community, who are enduring the unendurable,” McGowan said. “However, the community down here is strong and resilient. They look after their own. And we — as Western Australians — look after our own when beleaguered with affliction and anguish.”
AD
McGowan told reporters that he does not believe the government should take action on gun control after the shooting.
“We have some of the tightest gun laws in the world, and we’re an example to the rest of the world that you need to have very careful and strict controls,” he said, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.
He said officials will wait for the coroner’s report to determine what legislative steps, if any, should be taken.

Here's what you need to know about Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, the gunman who opened fire at two military facilities in Tenn., killing four Marines. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)
A few months before he killed five U.S. service members in a shooting rampage here, the 24-year-old gunman, who often joked that he was just an “Arabian redneck,” was smoking marijuana with friends.
It was getting late and Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez had work the next morning at his new job some two hours away in Franklin, said a close friend who was with him that night and spent several hours with him in the days leading up to the shooting.
Abdulazeez dropped off a couple of his friends at their homes on the night in April, snorted some crushed caffeine pills and started to drive.
A little after 2 a.m., Abdulazeez was arrested for driving under the influence, according to court papers, an incident sharply at odds with blog posts in which he portrayed himself as a devout Muslim and his existence in this world a “prison of monotony and routine.”

The Marine was killed in Chattanooga, Tenn. David Goldman/AP Wait 1 second to continue.
The portrait emerging of Abdulazeez isn’t one of a committed Muslim or vengeful jihadist, but rather an aimless young man who came from a troubled home and struggled to hold down a job after college, said friends and law enforcement officials.
He never dated, the friend said.
In a statement, his family said Abdulazeez’s mental illness had contributed to the crime. “For many years, our son suffered from depression. It grieves us beyond belief to know that his pain found its expression in this heinous act of violence,” the statement said.
Abdulazeez had been in and out of treatment for his depression and frequently stopped taking his medication, despite his parents’ pleas for him to continue, said a person close to the family.
Abdulazeez smoked pot occasionally and then would feel guilty for violating his faith and beat himself up for it, said the close friend who has known Abdulazeez for 15 years and was recently questioned by the FBI. The friend, also a Muslim, spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity because he is concerned for his family’s privacy.
The friend said Abdulazeez was especially ashamed of his DUI arrest, which led to his mugshot being posted online and in Just Busted, a newspaper sold at local gas stations.
“He was pretty upset about it,” said the friend, who spoke with Abdulazeez almost daily in the weeks and days leading up to the shooting. “It was kind of degrading to him.”
Abdulazeez’s friends said he liked to shoot guns, drive four-wheelers through the mud and hike in the mountains. Within the past year, he bought two assault rifles — an AK-74 and an AR-15 — and a Saiga 12 pistol-grip shotgun from an online weapons site. Abdulazeez and his friends would drive out to the Prentice Cooper State Forest, where they would blast away at the state park’s gun range. None of his friends thought twice about his decision to purchase military-style assault weapons.
“Take any typical Chattanoogan — Christian or Muslim — and he’s going to like to shoot guns, ride trucks and climb mountains,” the friend said.
Abdulazeez’s father was angry when he spotted one of the assault rifles in their home, and Abdulazeez hid other guns from him. “His dad was always against him having guns and said they weren’t safe to have around the house,” the friend said. Abdulazeez insisted that he was old enough to handle them responsibly.
The friend and Abdulazeez — along with two other young Muslim men — spent hundreds of hours together over the past four years, including the weeks and months leading up to the violent attack. Sometimes they talked about the Middle East’s bloody wars, such as the battles between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the chaos in Syria.
Abdulazeez blamed some of the bloodshed on U.S. foreign policy.
“All of us are upset right now about the fighting. It wasn’t anything that would throw up red flags,” said the friend. “We never would have seen this coming at all, but especially from him. Nobody suspected a thing. If we had, we would have done something to prevent this from happening.”
Indeed, the most striking thing about the last days that Abdulazeez spent with friends is how normal they appear to have been. Two days before the shooting, he texted his friend to ask if he wanted to go hot-rodding outside Chattanooga.
“You wanna go to lookout?” he asked, referring to the mountain on the city’s outskirts.
“IDK,” the friend replied. “I might have to run a few more errands.”
“I hear ya,” Abdulazeez texted back. “Let me know.”
The two men met up later that night around 11 p.m. and took off in a Ford Mustang Abdulazeez had rented — the same car that he used in the attacks. They drove for hours around the curving mountain roads surrounding Chattanooga. “We talked and had a lot of ‘oh [expletive]’ moments,” said the friend who recalls returning home around 3 a.m. Wednesday.
On Wednesday night, the friends exchanged texts for the last time. The friend was struggling with how to balance his Muslim faith with the more secular demands of his work, which included serving bacon to customers.
Abdulazeez responded a quote from the prophet Muhammad — that speaks to the tensions in the world between believers and non-believers. “Whosoever shows enmity to a wali [friend] of Mine, then I have declared war against him,” it begins. It ends by encouraging devout Muslims to keep the faith and draw closer to God.
Although the exchange suggests Abdulazeez was devout, he often seemed to struggle with his faith. Abdulazeez was fasting for the Ramadan holiday, which requires Muslims not to eat or drink during daylight hours. But he doesn’t appear to have regularly attended his parents’ mosque in the months leading up to the shooting, according to members of the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga.
“The father came regularly. The mother did occasionally,” said Bassam Issa, the president of the society, which includes the mosque. “We really didn’t know much about the boy. He wasn’t around.”
Abdulazeez also struggled to find work after he graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with an engineering degree. He briefly landed a job at a nuclear power plant in Ohio but was dismissed when he failed a background check. He told friends he had failed the company’s drug test after smoking marijuana.
He remained in Ohio, where he lived with relatives and worked for a moving company.
Back home, his family also appeared to be struggling. His mother had filed for divorce in 2009, alleging physical and sexual abuse, but later pulled the petition. In recent years, their house, in a middle-class suburb of neatly tended lawns and towering oaks, began to fall into disrepair. The home’s wooden clapboards are warped, and the gray paint is peeling. The lawn is badly overgrown.
Issa said that immediately after the shooting, Abdulazeez’s father apologized for the damage his son had done. “He was distraught,” Issa said. “His voice was broken, and he said he was very sorry for what his son caused to the community of Chattanooga and the Islamic community here.”
Issa wondered if Abdulazeez had been radicalized during his several trips to Jordan, the last in 2014 when he was in the region for seven months.
“It has to be the overseas trip that caused this,” he said. “That’s the only thing I can figure out.”
Others who knew Abdulazeez when he was a mixed-martial-arts fighter reflected on his time in the ring, searching their memory for signs of potential violence.
Chet Blalock, owner of Blalock’s International Mixed Martial Arts Gym in Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., described Abdulazeez as “very respectful” but stubbornly determined.
“My students would get him in a chokehold, and he wouldn’t tap out,” Blalock said, describing an incident in 2012. “He would just go to sleep.”
“It was a little crazy,” he added.
Less than two hours after the violent rampage, Abdulazeez’s friend texted him to check when they’d be able to meet up for the Muslim holiday of Eid. He’d seen the news alerts about the shooting in Chattanooga and wanted to talk about it with Abdulazeez, who he assumed was still at his new job outside Nashville.
By that point, Abdulazeez was already dead.""" ;

I got briefed about what they do in Nevada. I can’t remember by who,” Graham told reporters in the Capitol.
AD
This is the state of Graham’s solo investigation into election laws in states that President Trump narrowly lost in this month’s election.
AD
Along the way, Graham has turned himself into a lightning rod among state officials who want nothing to do with his probe, while his Senate colleagues try to politely dismiss his stumbling effort as a one-man show that is mostly a distraction.
In an interview Monday with The Washington Post, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, accused the senator of trying to pressure him into tossing out legally cast ballots. And Tuesday, after Graham mistakenly told reporters he had spoken with secretaries of state in Arizona and Nevada, those officials rejected that assertion.
AD
“I have not spoken to Senator Lindsey Graham or any other members of Congress regarding the 2020 election,” Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, said in a statement. Cegavske and Raffensperger are Republicans.
AD
That raised another question. In what capacity is Graham acting?
“As a United States senator who is worried about the integrity of the election process,” Graham told reporters.
Could any U.S. senator conduct his or her own investigation? “Sure,” he said.
Democrats view this as the latest drift from Graham’s onetime warning to Republicans that a Trump presidency would be “death by being shot” for their party. Instead, Democrats now see Graham as a close presidential confidant who careens from controversy to controversy, conspiracy theory to conspiracy theory, with little to show for his efforts other than attention from Trump and the media.
AD
Old friends and colleagues issued warnings Tuesday that there is a line Graham cannot cross with state election officials.
“If all he’s trying to do is get information, people are entitled to do that. If he’s trying to influence the way they perform their duty, that becomes a bit problematic,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former state attorney general.
AD
“Without knowing what was said, I can’t tell which is which,” added Whitehouse, who has traveled abroad frequently with Graham on official trips.
Another Democrat put the onus on state officials to blow off Graham.
“The wonderful thing about being a state elected official, as I recall well, is you don’t have to give a hoot what a United States senator says to you,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).
AD
Blumenthal, who was Connecticut’s attorney general for 20 years, said he received his share of pressure from U.S. senators, particularly when he sued the tobacco industry over its lies to Congress and false advertising campaigns.
“I received some of these calls from U.S. Senators asking me to back down and I said, ‘Well, thanks for the call, but the voters of Connecticut are the ones who hire me.’ So I think these secretaries of state have an obligation of independence,” Blumenthal said.
AD
On Tuesday, Graham said that part of his motivation was to clarify the rules in the upcoming Jan. 5 runoff elections for Georgia’s two Senate seats, which, if both tip to Democrats, would give them the majority next year after Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) are sworn in as president and vice president.
AD
Graham seemed particularly concerned with the signature-matching procedures used to authenticate mail-in ballots.
“Are you going to change the way you do business before these Senate runoffs? … How does it work in Georgia? Is it bipartisan?” Graham said Tuesday, outlining his line of inquiry. “Here’s my bottom line: Any signature-verification system, when it comes to mail-in balloting, needs to be bipartisan.”
Graham went on to say that he has learned that different states handle this in different ways, which has troubled Trump campaign officials.
AD
“Apparently in Nevada, they have a machine that can verify signatures — which I’m okay with,” the senator said, explaining that the Trump campaign has complained about how the machine was set to read signatures.
AD
But he favors Arizona’s process, he said. “They train people in forensics, they have people who look at the signatures,” Graham recounted. “If there’s a dispute, they actually try to call the voter up.”
It’s unusual, but not unheard of, for individual senators to launch their own probes into possible misconduct.
In 2008, after the New England Patriots were caught taping their opponents’ practices, then-Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) launched a solo investigation, in large part because his favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, had lost the 2005 Super Bowl to the Patriots and he wanted to ferret out any potential cheating.
AD
Specter’s probe took several years and ended when he lost reelection in 2010. He died in 2012 without ever issuing a report.
In Georgia, state officials showed additional irritation Tuesday with Graham’s intrusion into their world. Gabriel Sterling, a senior staffer in the secretary of state’s office, held a news conference to explain what he heard on the call between Raffensperger and Graham.
AD
“What I heard were discussions of absentee ballots — if there were a percentage of signatures that weren’t truly matching, is there some point where we could go to court and throw out all the ballots,” Sterling said.
Such an action would have disenfranchised many legally cast ballots.
Although Graham is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, election laws have long fallen to the Senate Rules Committee, chaired by Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).
AD
Blunt laughed at the suggestion that Graham was interfering with his committee’s jurisdiction. He said he had read every word of The Post’s story outlining Raffensperger’s account and came away with the view that Graham was not really threatening the state officials.
AD
“I wasn’t concerned about that as I looked through it and read it carefully,” said Blunt, a former Missouri secretary of state. “I mean, every senator can talk to anybody who will pick up the phone and talk to them, and any secretary of state should be willing to talk to any senator who calls them.”
On Tuesday, when Harris appeared on the Senate floor, Graham walked over and gave her a congratulatory fist bump.
Graham’s colleagues increasingly saw this latest version of his activities as somewhat farcical, rather than political extortion.""" ;

For the past 35 years, Nuri Sahin has sold carpets in the historic center of Istanbul. He can’t remember a time when business was so bad and fears that it will only get worse.
Just a smattering of tourists ventured to the plazas and cobbled streets near his shop on Wednesday, a day after a suicide bomber thought to be linked to the Islamic State killed at least 10 people after approaching a group of German tourists and detonating his vest. Meanwhile, Turkish authorities carried out raids across the country, arresting one person in connection with the attack, according to Turkish Interior Minister Efkan Ala.
Terrorist attacks are nothing new for Turkey, but Tuesday’s bloodshed marked a possible pivot point: the Islamic State apparently turning its focus toward the tourism sector in a country that draws about 40 million visitors a year.
The attack took place near three of Istanbul’s most famed tourist attractions: the Blue Mosque, the Ottoman-era Topkapi Palace and the Hagia Sophia, a former mosque and Christian basilica that’s now a museum.
“The tourists will be scared for a year,” said Sahin, 47. “This is the first time we’ve had anything like this in the heart of our tourism area.”
[Turkey key to Islamic State’s underground economy]
His colleague, Suleyman Bala, 33, witnessed the blast as he sat near the Obelisk of Theodosius, an ancient Egyptian monolith. The square was relatively quiet, he said, with just two tour groups: one of Germans, another of South Koreans. When the blast went off, he dropped to the ground.
“It was all around me, body parts, blood,” he said. “So many pieces of people and people running, people scared.”
Germany’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that all 10 who died were German citizens. Previous reports had said a Peruvian was also killed.
Seventeen were injured, and 11 remain in the hospital. Turkish authorities have blamed the Islamic State for the attack, though the group has not asserted responsibility.
During a visit to Istanbul, Germany’s interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said there was no reason to think that the attack was directed specifically at Germans, who make up the largest group of visitors to the country.
The number of Russian tourists began to drop after Moscow advised its citizens not to visit amid worsening relations following Turkey’s downing of a Russian fighter jet in November.
[NATO faces new Mideast crisis after downing of Russian jet by Turkey]
With the bomb attack Tuesday, the Islamic State risks a harsher crackdown from Turkish authorities, who have been criticized for not doing enough to prevent the country from being used as a conduit for supplies and recruits. But the militants appear increasingly desperate to strike overseas as they lose territory in Iraq and Syria.
In a joint news conference with Maiziere, Ala said that a woman was detained late Tuesday in Istanbul in connection with the attack, but he gave no further details.
It was one of a series of raids in the wake of the attack against suspected Islamic State cells.
In the Mediterranean city of Antalya, three Russians were detained for allegedly providing logistical support to the militant group, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Six other suspected militants were arrested in raids in the province of Izmir on the Aegean coast.
The alleged bomber, a 28-year-old Syrian named Nabil Fadli, was not on any militant watch list but had registered and given fingerprints at an immigration office a week before the blast, Ala said. Quoting security sources, the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily said that he had registered for asylum in Istanbul on Jan. 5 with four other men.
The pan-Arab daily newspaper al-Hayat reported that the man was born in Saudi Arabia but left at age 8 with his family.
The bombing took place just yards from the city’s Blue Mosque, whose nine domes and six minarets are one of the most recognizable features of the city’s skyline.
“It’s just very, very sad,” said Kate Burton, a 36-year-old Australian tourist, wiping away tears as she and her husband went to buy flowers to lay at the scene of the blast. “You get to know the locals, you really feel for them.”
She said they would not be deterred from visiting again. But Sahin had his doubts.
“I’ve never seen it like this in my life,” he said, adding that business was already down 70 to 80 percent. “We are scared now that the third world war is coming.”

Here's what you need to know about Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, the gunman who opened fire at two military facilities in Tenn., killing four Marines. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)
A 24-year-old gunman armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle and a handgun moved methodically through a Naval Reserve center last week in Chattanooga, Tenn., as he hunted for Marines and sailors to kill, a senior FBI official said Wednesday.
Edward Reinhold, special agent in charge of the FBI’s field office in Knoxville, Tenn., provided the first definitive account of the terrorist attack that left four Marines and a Navy petty officer dead.
Reinhold told reporters at a news conference in Chattanooga that Mohammad Youssef Abdul­azeez smashed through the gate of the reserve center last Thursday and was almost immediately confronted by a service member who had his own gun.
The service member fired several rounds, but it has not yet been determined whether he managed to hit Abdulazeez, who quickly entered the reserve center looking for targets, mortally wounding the sailor inside the building.
“He then made his way throughout the building continuing to shoot at those who he encountered,” Reinhold said.
[A Marine wounded at the recruiting office in Chattanooga speaks about his ordeal]
Reinhold said Abdulazeez exited the back of the building, killing the Marines outside in the motor-pool area as some of them tried to climb over a fence and escape.
The FBI said that moments later, officers with the Chattanooga Police Department arrived and killed Abdulazeez, ending an episode that lasted between three and five minutes at the reserve center.
A top general said the Marines, who had just returned from a training mission, had braved gunfire to save their comrades during the attack.
“The legacy that day is one of valor,” said Maj. Gen. Paul Brier, commander of the 4th Marine Division. “I can tell you that our Marines reacted the way you would expect. Some willingly ran back into the fight.”
Killed Thursday in the assault were Gunnery Sgt. Thomas J. Sullivan, 40, Staff Sgt. David A. Wyatt, 35, Sgt. Carson A. Holmquist, 25, and Lance Cpl. Squire K. “Skip” Wells, 21.
Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith, 26, the fifth service member killed in the attack, died from his wounds early Saturday.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.
Before entering the Navy Operational Support Center, Abdulazeez, while still in a rented Ford Mustang convertible, fired dozens of rounds into a recruiting office less than 10 miles away.
Five Marines inside the reserve center fled through the rear of the building. One was wounded.
Reinhold said that two other weapons were recovered at the reserve center and that both belonged to service members, including the one fired at Abdulazeez. Another handgun was found near one of the fallen Marines.
“Whether he was struck by those individuals is unclear at this time,” he said. “The autopsy results are pending, and once we get those we’ll make that determination.”
The military is also investigating why the service members were armed, the FBI said. The Pentagon restricts who can carry weapons at domestic military facilities.
It appeared that all of the victims were killed with the same weapon, ruling out “friendly fire,” according to Reinhold.
In addition to the weapons Abdulazeez had on him when he was killed, the FBI discovered a shotgun in his car and another semiautomatic assault rifle in his house.
The FBI is still investigating whether Abdulazeez had any ties to terrorists and what led to the attack. Agents seized personal notes from his house that hinted at extremist views, officials said.
Abdulazeez had also searched the Internet for topics such as martyrdom, possibly as a way to escape his family’s financial difficulties and his depression, the FBI learned after examining his online communications.
“It certainly appears by all accounts that he was self-radicalized,” said a family representative, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the case. “He was in a downward spiral and appears to have hit the bottom of this spiral. He appears to have committed this heinous act in a sort of perverse attempt to redeem himself.”
“We are treating him as a homegrown violent extremist. We believe he acted on his own that day,” Reinhold said. “We don’t have any indication that anyone else was assisting him that day.”
Officials are also looking at a seven-month trip Abdulazeez took last year to Jordan, where he spent time with his grandfather and uncle. His parents sent him there because of concerns over his use of drugs and alcohol.
Jordanian intelligence detained his uncle, Asad Ibrahim Asad Haj Ali, a businessman and naturalized U.S. citizen, who lived in Virginia until 2010.
The family representative said Jordanian intelligence questioned the uncle and then arrested him.
One of the gunman’s friends, James Petty, said he saw Abdul­azeez on July 10 at the local mosque, a week before the deadly rampage.
“That day he was happy,” Petty said.""" ;

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama whilst severe and supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, tornadic parameters became even more favorable as moisture, instability, deep-layer shear, and low-level shear maximized in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor. Though a total six tornadoes impacted areas across southern and southeastern Central Alabama that afternoon, 34 other tornadoes occurred in association with discrete supercells and the quasi-linear convective system that moved eastward into areas of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina in the afternoon and overnight hours.

<https://www.weather.gov/ctp/TornadoOutbreak_May311985> dct:description """Bob Davis - Lead Forecaster at NWS Pittsburgh
I worked the 4pm-midnight shift on May 31st. I had just been promoted to lead forecaster in March of 1985. This was my first severe weather shift as a lead forecaster.
I arrived at the office about 3:30 PM to a cloudless sky, but warm and humid conditions. I relieved Bill Drzal who was the lead forecaster on the day shift, and Bill briefed me on the tornado potential. He could not understand why no thunderstorms had popped yet. Bill was in the Air Force reserve, and I had been a weather officer in the Air Force between my BS and MS degrees from Penn State. The staff routinely plotted the Pittsburgh RAOB [upper air observations collected via a weather balloon] at 12z and 00z and hung them on the wall at the office. Bill and I were deeply into severe weather analysis with soundings, and Bill said look at this morning's sounding. I have never seen a sounding in Pittsburgh look so bad. Yet here we were at 3:30 in the afternoon and not one shower had popped yet on the radar.
The threat of severe weather was so great that we had actually headlined the possibility in the zone forecasts at 4 AM on the previous midnight shift. The outlook from SELS [now the Storm Prediction Center] was a moderate risk of severe storms and tornadoes.
This was the era of Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFOs) and satellite Weather Service Offices (WSOs). Pittsburgh had zone forecast responsibility for all of Western Pennsylvania as far east as Potter, Clinton, Centre, Mifflin, Juniata, Huntingdon, and Franklin counties and the NW counties of Erie, Crawford, Warren, and McKean. The Erie WSO was in our zone area, and they had warning responsibility as far south as Venango, Forest, Elk and Cameron Counties. The Youngstown WSO had warning responsibility for Mercer and Lawrence Counties in PA and Trumbull and Mahoning Counties in OH. The Youngstown WSO radar often went down with thunderstorms in the area, and when this occurred, as it did the night of May 31st, Pittsburgh took over warning responsibility for their two Pennsylvania Counties.
The 4:33 PM radar observation indicated that two cells had fired in Ashtabula County, OH, just west of Erie County, PA. Between this scan and the next one at 4:55 PM, the cells had strengthened rapidly. I called the Erie WSO to let them know about the serious strengthening of the storms and he said I have two hook echoes on my radar. So in twenty minutes we went from no echoes on the radars to two tornadoes. The F4 tornado that went through Albion in southeast Erie County first touched down just west of the PA-OH border at 2059z (4:59 PM). The second F4 that went through Corry in Eastern Erie County touched down at 5:25 PM.
At 4:20 PM SELS issued the tornado watch 211, valid at 5pm. The Pittsburgh staff then had to update the 4PM zone issuance to include the Tornado watch.
The cell speed of the storms was from the west at about 50 knots. Each rapidly moving storm laid down a significant outflow boundary and resulted in new cell formation further to the south of the previous storms. This process continued from 4pm to about 8pm resulting in serious tornado activity across the entire Erie WSO warning area. The storms continued to develop southward into the Pittsburgh warning area.
At the Pittsburgh Office, the hours from 5 PM to 8 PM were consumed with issuing tornado warnings for monster storms in Mercer (F5 that went through Wheatland), Beaver (F3 through Big Beaver) and into southern Butler county. One of the strongest storms of the night moved across Clarion and Jefferson Counties. The vertical extent of the storm was astounding as it moved across. There was no verification in Clarion, and the county Emergency Manager indicated that it was very dark but not even rain was falling. The storm was developing aloft and remain aloft across all of Clarion County. Jefferson County also indicated no reports of severe weather until golf ball sized hail was reported in Brookville as the storm rapidly exited Jefferson County and moved into southern Elk County about 7:20 PM. This storm went on to produce a F4 tornado with a track of over 60 miles across portions of Clearfield, Centre, and Clinton counties. As the storm was entering Clinton County, I got a call for a guy named Greg Forbes, who was sitting at the radar console at Penn State. Greg said that a tremendous tornadic storm was pushing into Clinton County. I thanked him for the report and told him I would pass the information onto the Harrisburg WSO who had warning responsibility for Clinton. In the years that followed, I got to spend some time with Greg at various American Meteorological Society conferences, and we often talked about the wild night of May 31st in 1985. At the time of the call, I did not know who Greg was, or that he had been one of the few PhD candidates of Dr Ted Fujita. Gregg did extensive aerial photography of the 1985 tornado event.
The F3 across Big Beaver and into Butler County touched down at about the exact same time as the F4 in Moshannon State Forest around 7:35 PM. After 8 PM, the outflow from the Big Beaver storm initiated a new storm that produced an F1 short track tornado in East Sparta, OH just west of the Pittsburgh WSR-57 radar. This storm was headed directly for our office, but it collapsed and died completely before reaching the PA border with OH. That was the end of the convection for the evening and just as suddenly as the event started, it was over.
The Pittsburgh Office did not hear about any of the fatalities from the storms or the extent of the damage until well after 8 PM. This is not uncommon in very severe outbreaks as communications and widespread power outages disrupt the flow of information. Often the true extent of damage is not known until the disaster survey team can inspect the damage the next day.
In the 28 years I spent at the Pittsburgh office following May 31st until my retirement in 2013, I did not work a single severe weather shift with an F3, F4, or F5 tornado. I used up my entire career severe tornado quota on my first severe weather shift as a lead forecaster. This was truly a once in a career type of event.
My father-in-law lived in Punxsutawney, PA and belonged to the Punxsutawney Hunting Club. They had their hunting camp in Clearfield County near Parker Dam State Park. In 1987 we went on a family picnic with him to Parker Dam and he took me on a little road trip through Moshannon State Park. The tree coverage is very dense in the forest with deep shade even on sunny days. As we travelled along the road, we broke out of the tree cover and came across the Moshannon State Park F4 tornado path that was over one mile wide. Every tree, some with trunk diameters over 3 feet, had been sheared off about 15 feet above the ground. This area is very hilly terrain and the tornado did not skip from one hill to the next, but went right down into the valley and up the other side for a far as the eye could see. Keep in mind that this F4 was on the ground for over 60 miles.""" ;

FORT WORTH, Texas — Updated at 7:45 a.m. Wednesday with information about Dallas County.
The line at the Tarrant County sub-courthouse in southeast Fort Worth stretched for several blocks Tuesday morning.
Yolanda White and her parents decided to come back after it shrunk to cast their ballots.
“I was really excited to see so many people out on the first day of early voting,” White said. “We’ve only been here less than an hour now.”
Tarrant County ended the first day of early voting with 42,428 ballots cast, just under the 43,140 from the first day in 2016. In 2016, its highest early voting turnout day was the last day of early voting.
“You’re at the top the rollercoaster looking down about to be dropped on it,” Heider Garcia, Tarrant County’s Elections Administrator said. “I think it’s going very well to be honest with you.”
The first day issues included a Euless location closing because of a poll worker’s COVID-19 case, and a couple others opening late because of the positive test.
“It could have been disastrous, but we had a plan and it worked,” said Garcia.
He added that online wait times weren’t updating right, so they’re working to fix the issue moving forward.
In Dallas County, there were long lines as well. But there, election workers saw record numbers of voters for the first day of early voting: the final number was 59,905 people, according to election officials.
The 2016 race had set the previous record for Dallas County, Judge Clay Jenkins tweeted out, with 58,775 people turning out to vote on the first day then.
And while there is an extra week to vote early this year, Garcia still recommends people go as soon as they can. There are 50 voting locations now open across Tarrant County and 61 across Dallas County for voters to do just that.
“Things get better and flow smoother as the days go by,” said Garcia.
He says lines are good sign and they always hope for the enthusiasm to vote. After months of waiting, what’s another couple of hours.""" ;

<https://www.wilmatheater.org/blog/agnieszka-arnold-documentary-filmmaker-%E2%80%93-part-one> dct:description """Kasia Kubin, a young woman who had grown up in the Philadelphia suburbs, and I are meeting the documentary filmmaker Agnieszka Arnold. Kasia’s English is perfect and she translates flawlessly.
Agnieszka Arnold was the first artist to touch on the subject of Jedwabne Jews. In her documentary Neighbors, Agnieszka interviews witnesses, participants and survivors of the massacres of an estimated 1,600 Jews in Jedwabne and 800 in Radzilow and other nearby villages. She finished the film in 1997 with no hope that the documentary would ever be broadcast. She started to show the film to her friends, and to whoever wanted to watch. This is what inspired Jan Gross, who saw the film, to do his research and write the book Neighbors, using the same title with Agnieszka's permission. After Jan Gross’s book was published in 2000, Agnieszka’s documentary was shown on Polish National Television in 2001 and viewed by two million people.
Agnieszka’s apartment is on the top floor of a five story building. Kasia finds the apartment very unusual. It’s full of old furniture. Because of the horrendous destruction of the city, antique furniture must have been difficult to find in Warsaw after the war.
‘I hate Our Class. It’s simpleminded and vulgar. How else can I help you?’ Agnieszka says as an introduction. She is an intense, emotional, and brilliant woman, with white hair falling into her eyes, and a deep raspy voice that is colored by the inhalation of numerous daily cigarettes. ‘May I smoke?’ she asks.
Agnieszka and Tadeusz are not on friendly terms. Agnieszka is a documentary filmmaker who believes in facts. In her mind, writing a fiction about historical events vulgarizes them. She is not interested in psychological complications and details. Agnieszka believes that Tadeusz’s play simplifies the problem of anti-Semitism, which, according to her, is still very much alive not only in Poland but also in the rest of Europe. To her, the play suggests a general notion that people are flawed, that evil exists on both sides – that both the Catholic and the Jewish Poles are implicated. She thinks that the play focuses too much on the Soviet occupation, incriminating the Jews for collaborating with the Soviets and justifying the need for the Catholic Poles’ revenge. ‘In the play, they are all equal in their behavior,’ she complains. ‘The play tries to explain Evil through psychology. But the reason for the pogrom was pure and simple Polish anti-Semitism,’ she insists.
Later I read that Agnieszka belongs to the Polish Evangelical Church, a small minority in Poland, where 90% of the population is Catholic. In her film she interviews an old couple. The husband, Stanislaw, saved his wife Rachela, who became Marianna and converted to Catholicism, by marrying her. He later rescued her after she had been taken to a ghetto for extermination. After that, they had to hide in the countryside and forest for almost four years during the war. After the 2001 release of the film, where both were interviewed as witnesses of the July 10, 1941 atrocities in Jedwabne, the couple received death threats. Agnieszka put them up secretly in an Evangelic Home where they lived until their death.
‘In Poland, anti-Semitism has been present even after World War II,’ Agnieszka continues. She makes the point that after 1945 not a single historian or literary historian mentions in their scholarship that Jews comprised 10% of the population of Poland ‘There is not a single book from the post war period that discusses the influence of Jews on Polish culture.’ Agnieszka adds, “Jedwabne has become a symbol. The elite recognize that maybe a pogrom did happened, maybe it’s true, but it was done by the peasants! They say this and then like Pontius Pilate, they’ll wash their hands.” Agnieszka implies that the intellectual Polish elite has develops a very comfortable vision; they recognize the atrocities that happened, but the perpetrators were Polish farmers, not them. She also questions the silence of American Jews. “Why didn’t they do anything? Why weren’t they interested in what was happening in Poland?” According to Agnieszka, the Polish Catholic Church is also guilty of anti-Semitism. “Just look at the images of Jews in Crucifixion pictures hanging on the walls of Catholic Churches. They make them look like devils or animals.’

Notes
The Micronesia Population (Live) counter shows a continuously updated estimate of the current population of Micronesia delivered by Worldometer's RTS algorithm, which processes data collected from the United Nations Population Division.
The Population of Micronesia (1950 - 2019) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2019.
Definitions
Thechart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2019. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.
Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated.
Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the sub-region as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.
Yearly % Change: For 2019: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2018 to June 30 2019). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.
Yearly Change: For 2019: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2018 to June 30 2019). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period.
Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.
Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution.
Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the countries within Micronesia, and assuming she is not subject to mortality.
Density (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²).
Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population.
Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country.
Micronesia's Share of World Pop: Total population as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.
World Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.
Rank within Oceania: Position held by Micronesia in the list of all regions within Oceania ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year indicated.

U2‘s “360” tour set records with its enormous stage design that allowed the audience to almost surround the entire stage from all directions. Well, EDC Las Vegas literally blew it out of the water.
EDC’s “Kinetic Cathedral” stood at a cool 440 feet wide – about 80 feet longer than a football field – and a mere 80 feet tall – more than twice the length of a 65-passenger school bus. Twice as big as U2’s world-renowned “360” stage, which previously held the record, and almost six times as big as Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” tour’s stage, EDC’s record is force to be reckoned with. The stage also featured 28 LED displays, 1,000 light fixtures, and 30 lasers, requiring a total of 2.5 million watts of power to function!
From huge book shelves, to massive volcanos, to gigantic owls, EDM festivals have been getting bigger and better, and it’s awesome. The question is, however, where do they go from here? Will Insomniac be able to one-up their own record by next year? We’ll just have to wait and see.

<https://www.youredm.com/2019/04/04/ultra-music-festival-2019-was-confusing-spectacular-in-every-way-review/> dct:description """On Sunday, March 24, I had a lot of thoughts on the week leading up to and the weekend of Ultra Music Festival. What can one say in a review that captures what happened in its entirety? Making my way past the Live Arena with Armin van Buuren and the Worldwide Stage with Zeds Dead, I turned back and looked at the main stage marking the last time I would see it this past weekend. The Chainsmokers were there throwing down a set featuring the bass components of Illenium, NGHTMRE, Gammer and the like with live renditions and remixes of their own hits. And then it hit me. As to what hit me and how, we’ll need to extrapolate on the whole weekend and the context surrounding it.
Leading up to Ultra Music Festival 2019 was some of the most confused hype of any music festival, especially in EDM. After another successful year at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami in 2018, everyone in attendance witnessed what had become the standard expectations that Ultra delivers. This includes the following:
Exclusive performances and art from one-of-a-kind artists, DJs and musicians
Unreleased and exclusive music from multiple genres
Stellar stage, lighting, pyrotechnic and mixing production
Competent security, police, and fire-rescue personnel keeping track of attendees
Wide array of vendors and staff from the water stations to the merchandise booths and everything in between
These points are what has made Ultra Music Festival in Bayfront Park one of the most coveted and phenomenal music festival productions the world has to offer. Couple that with the sweetest real estate and it becomes clear as daylight why people from over 105 different countries book flights and hotels months in advance for this event.
So when news broke that Ultra were ousted from Bayfront Park by the city and its residents five months later, it felt like UMF had to work with a 180 flip on everything they had been getting right since 2012. They had to use the time that it takes them to do all the aforementioned points while finding a whole new location in five months. And when they reached an agreement with the city council of Miami to relocate to Virginia Key, they faced backlash from two new parties: the residents/mayor of Key Biscayne and Rapture Electronic Music Festival.
But despite the speed-bumps and improvisation that led to last weekend, Ultra Music Festival 2019 still happened. As much as the elements appeared to tower against this event, its organizers, and its attendees, Ultra Music Festival curated eight stages for 170,000 fans across the weekend that included surprise guests and viral moments. Hell, a guy wearing a cartoon-style Colonel Sanders (Kentucky Fried Chicken) helmet took to the main stage to perform in the five-minute space between two sets and we’re still talking about it. That’s without even diving into the other events that have evolved into their own stories. This includes but is not limited to Malaa’s unorthodox prison release, Cash Cash treating a mixer like Steve Aoki treats cake, or Shaquille O’Neal moshing during NGHTMRE and Slander’s Gud Vibrations set.

And we have to talk about the elephant that walked 2.5 miles on the Rickenbacker Causeway last Friday night. As one of the tens of thousands of attendees stuck in Virginia Key and seeing a tree burst into flames, things got scary for a moment. And after we crossed the bridge, it was easier to find ride-sharing options to get home as soon as possible. But Ultra Music Festival was quick to respond to what happened at the end of Day 1. They were also swift with tackling the issues with shuttles and congested lines that made Day 2 and Day 3 operations smooth and easy. Lines for shuttles and the ferry were managed with better instructions and cooperation from staff.
And to the people saying that this was a Fyre Festival sequel or equal to TomorrowWorld’s 2015 disaster, they do nothing but mis-characterize the entire situation.
The only issue Ultra Music Festival struggled with that affected attendees all three days was the distance between the Miami Marine Stadium and Historic Virginia Key Park. The stadium’s parking lot was the site of Ultra’s Main, Live, Worldwide, and Radio stages while the Carl Cox Megastructure, Reflector, Arrival, and Oasis stages invaded the park on their own Resistance Island. On one hand, this allowed the mainstream acts to be grouped on one side of the event and the underground house, tech house, and techno sets remained on the other side.
On the other hand, the distance between these two sites was quite a walk. It was such a walk that Ultra designated special staircases for guests to avoid crossing busy streets. The trail was expertly filled with speakers and LED screens with music and visuals to keep the entertainment flowing, but that walk was killer for fans of acts on both sides of the event. For example, if an Ultra attendee wanted to see Tom Morello perform at the Live Stage starting at 7pm but also wanted to see Loco Dice at the Megastructure at 8pm, they would have to leave between 15-30 minutes before the end of the first set to make it in time for the start of the second set. If Ultra can shorten the gap between these two sides of their own event for the future, it would be a return to what makes Ultra Music Festival a special experience where all the acts are immediately and easily accessible.

The sets between both sites were incredible and varied, as expected. Catching Enrico Sangiuliano or Camelphat going back-to-back with Solardo was an incandescent inferno of lasers and ravers. Meanwhile, the UMF Radio stage was the site of some of the greatest stretch of versatility. Drum and bass icon Spor or bounce house star Justin Mylo was a super-charged punch of bass, rhythm, and energy. By the Main stage, acts like Fedde le Grand reminded us what fans love about electronic music while the Gud Vibrations set by NGHTMRE & Slander set a new bar for dubstep/trap DJs everywhere. And probably the top set of all was with Skrillex and Boys Noize resurrecting Dog Blood with new music, unmatched vigor and a special appearance from Ty Dolla $ign.
Looking back at the mayhem and jubilee that followed these three days, the thoughts of Ultra continued to swirl. Their new chapter from a rocky start to their powerful closing was something that only Ultra Music Festival could have pulled off. That was my realization. Only Ultra could plan an event with less than five full months of planning and still pull off a spectacular event on almost every front. When you consider the environmental, political, and logistical hurdles this organization had to deal with and overcome, it makes you wonder how they didn’t fail. Maybe it’s because they have a remarkable staff from top to bottom. Maybe it’s because the fans refused to let Day 1’s issues to define the whole weekend. Maybe it’s because the music was just too great. Or maybe it’s because, despite all the problems Ultra Music Festival overcame to throw their 21st edition, they still met their own high standards and gave us the only reason to catch them again in 2020.

Below, the Festive Owl shares an email laying out the multiple future event perks for hopeful Ultra attendees. Unfortunately, there’s no explicit option to be refunded, but organizers have worked hard to provide an “extraordinary added value package.”
Any 2020 ticket holder may redeem the following benefits:
One ticket to Ultra Music Festival 2021 or 2022
An extra hour at Ultra Miami 2021
One free ticket to an Ultra Worldwide or Resistance event (excluding Miami) in 2021
A discount for 50% off up to $250 in merchandise
Exclusive access to $99.95 Premium GA private sale to Ultra Miami 2021
Exclusive access to buy two more GA passes at $249.95 for Ultra Miami 2021
Chance at 10 Ultra Golden Tickets that admit a +1
“ALL tickets purchased will of course remain valid and will be honored at either the 2021 or 2022 Ultra Miami event, at your option,” Ultra explains. “You will have 30 days to choose which Ultra Miami event you want to attend. Additionally, we are also working to offer a digital online Ultra experience as soon as possible.”
Ultra ticket holders on Reddit are furious with the company, which has attempted to sell patrons on even more items as they’re still forced to eat the cost of current hotel and flight bookings as a result of the cancellation. Others suggest that even though the option for a refund isn’t explicitly stated in the “Claim My Benefits” package, you might find more luck replying directly to the email or threatening a charge back.

From the Gimme Shelter DVD:
Recorded December 7, 1969, KSAN's four-hour post-Altamont broadcast fielded calls from a range of people who attended the event and a few who helped organise it. Among those included in the excerpts that follow are Sam Cutler, Road/Production Manager for the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour; Emmett Grogan, a leader in San Francisco's counter-cultural movement; and Sonny Barger, then head of the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels. Stefan Ponek, the host of the original show, has recorded new introductions to the material especially for this Criterion DVD release.

He does well with certain sub-groups: voters aged 30+ (52% approve/47% disapprove), men (47% approve/51% disapprove), women (50% approve/48% disapprove), medium size city voters (47% approve/51% disapprove), small city voters (58% approve/42% disapprove), rural voters (63% approve/37% disapprove), NASCAR fans (64% approve/36% disapprove) and weekly Amazon shoppers (49% approve/51% disapprove).
The president did not fare so well with large city voters (35% approve/62% disapprove), African American voters (14% approve/83% disapprove), suburban voters (38% approve/58% disapprove), Millennials aged 18-29 (32% approve/64% disapprove) and weekly Walmart shoppers (45% approve/54% disapprove).
One of the trends that's emerged in our Georgia poll is that President Trump's support with men is not rock solid. When pitted against 2020 Democratic hopefuls, he receives less than 50% in every head to head match-up. Donald Trump is over-performing with women voters compared to men, both in his job approval rating and 2020 general election match-ups with Democratic candidates. Not winning a majority of men in a state like Georgia could give the president a big blow in the 2020 general election.
Joe Biden is the candidate the establishment thinks has the best chance to beat Trump, and hopefully take away voters from Trump's coalition. In this poll, we do see elements of that scenario playing out. Biden is beating Trump among men (Biden leads 47% to 42%) and non-college educated voters (Biden leads 46% to 42%), both groups being a big part of the Trump coalition. Biden also does well with younger Millennials aged 18-29 (Biden leads 63% to 24%), capturing a whopping two-thirds of them. He also edges out Trump with Generation X voters aged 30-49 (Biden leads 45% to 43%), which is a group the president has made strong in roads with as of late.
Interestingly, Trump and Biden are tied at 45% each among women voters in the state of Georgia. But Biden also does well with swing voters, such as, Independents (Biden leads 48% to 31%), moderates (Biden leads 61% to 23%), and Generation X voters aged 35-54 (both tied at 46%).
When it came to where voters live, Biden dominates large cities (Biden leads 63% to 26%), and wins easily in the suburbs (Biden leads 49% to 39%). He also does well with consumer blocs, such as, weekly Walmart shoppers (Biden leads 47% to 40%) and Amazon shoppers (both tied at 43%). President Trump still wins convincingly with NASCAR fans (Trump leads 58% to 37%). Not surprisingly, Biden also dominates Trump among African Americans leading, 81% to 7%.
Trump does well with voters aged 50+ (Trump leads 53% to 39%), union voters (Trump leads 54% to 41%), voters living in small cities (Trump leads 54% to 36%) and rural areas (Trump leads 57% to 35%).
Although, Biden prevails by only a couple of points, 46% to 44% against Trump, he has chipped away at Trump's base, mainly men and non-college educated voters. Still, Biden will have to do more than just win over these voters; he will also need to win more union and rural voters if the Democratic nominee is going win in Georgia for the first time since Bill Clinton in 1992.
In Georgia, Senator Bernie Sanders (VT-I) did the best against Trump, beating him by a five percent margin, 48% to 43%. It was no big surprise that Sanders dominates with the younger voters aged 18-29 (Sanders leads 70% to 21%). He also beats Trump with Generation X voters age 30-49 (Sanders leads 48% to 43%), while Trump won voters aged 50+ (Trump leads 53% to 39%).
Sanders cut into Trump's base by winning with men (Sanders leads 51% to 41%), non-college educated voters (Sanders leads 49% to 42%), and Independent voters (Sanders leads 56% to 28%). The senator from Vermont also did well with moderates (Sanders leads 56% to 28%), while also dominating among African American voters, receiving 83% support compared to only 5% for Trump.
Sanders also did very well with suburban voters (Sanders leads 53% to 38%) and won among consumer blocs, such as, weekly Walmart shoppers (Sanders leads 51% to 38%) and weekly Amazon shoppers (Sanders leads 53% to 41%). More importantly, Sanders made a break through with a big bloc of Trump voters: union voters (Sanders leads 49% to 47%).
Trump makes the potential general election match-up close by winning a majority of voters in the following categories: NASCAR fans (Trump leads 52% to 43%), voters living in small cities (Trump leads 56% to 37%) and rural areas (Trump leads 54% to 40%).
There are some areas where Trump and Sanders are neck and neck: women (both tied at 46%), union voters (Sanders leads 49% to 47%) and voters aged 35-54 (both tied at 46%). In order for Trump to win Georgia again, he will need to win more votes among the above mentioned groups and other important groups, i.e. NASCAR fans and rural voters, where his numbers are down compared to his figures nationally.
Overall, President Trump narrowly beats Democratic frontrunner, Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA-D) 44% to 42%. Trump continues to do well with Georgia women, beating Warren 47% to 41%. Warren turns the tables and receives more support with men (Warren leads 43% to 42%), younger Millennials age 18-29 (Warren leads 54% to 29%), Independents (Warren leads 39% to 33%) and African Americans (Warren leads 73% to 8%).
Trump maintains support among his base by receiving more support from non-college educated voters (Trump leads 44% to 40%), small city voters (Trump leads 55% to 37%), rural voters (Trump leads 54% to 32%), Catholics (Trump leads 46% to 42%), NASCAR fans (Trump leads 56% to 38%), and weekly Amazon shoppers (both tied at 41%).
Warren is doing damage to Trump, but not in the areas her other rivals, Biden and Sanders, are. Trump over-performs against Warren with suburban voters (Warren leads 43% to 42%), while Warren chips away at Trump's base and wins with weekly Walmart shoppers (Warren leads 44% to 40%) and union voters (Warren leads 46% to 38%).
As for the age of voters, Warren receives more support from voters under the age of 50 (Warren 46% to 37%), while inversely; Trump wins with voters aged 50+ (Trump leads 55% to 35%). Warren receives a majority of support from voters aged 18-29 (54% to 29%), while President Trump receives nearly two-thirds of support from voters age 65+.
Warren did not perform as well as Biden and Sanders among African Americans; she leads Trump 73% to 8%, while Biden and Sanders received support in the low to mid 80's from African American voters.
When it came to Democratic candidates who are a level below the frontrunners, but still considered relevant, Trump had a much easier time with Mayor Pete (Trump leads Buttigieg 45% to 38%) than Senator Kamala Harris, whom he narrowly defeats 44% to 42%
Kamala Harris was able to make more in-roads with potential swing voters and Trump's coalition than Buttigieg-she actually wins with men (Harris leads 43% to 42%), but Trump does better than the Senator from California with women voters (Trump leads 46% to 41%).
Both Buttigieg and Harris at times tap into the Trump coalition, such as Buttigieg being tied with Trump among weekly Walmart shoppers (both tied at 41%) and Amazon shoppers (both tied at 42%), while Harris beating Trump with Independents (Harris leads 40% to 31%, 29% unsure), weekly Walmart Shoppers (Harris leads 46% to 40%) and weekly Amazon shoppers (both tied at 43%).
However, neither Buttigieg nor Harris are doing well against Trump with women, suburban voters and Generation X voters aged 30-49 and those aged 35-54. These are the groups that can tip the balance in favor of Democrats or Republicans come November 2020.

<http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/nbc-s-final-battleground-map-shows-clinton-edge-n678926> dct:description """First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.
NBC’s final battleground map: Clinton 274, Trump 170
In our final battleground map of the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton holds a substantial lead over Donald Trump with one day before Election Day. Clinton has 274 electoral votes in her column -- which is unchanged from last week, and which also is more than the 270 needed to win the presidency. Trump, meanwhile, is at 170 electoral votes, down from 180 last week. And we have 94 electoral votes in the Tossup column.
We made only two changes to the map: We moved Utah from Tossup to Lean GOP, and we moved Georgia from Lean GOP to Tossup. That’s it.
The more things change, the more they stay the same
The final national NBC/WSJ poll we released yesterday morning told two stories. The first: It showed a tighter horserace. Clinton’s lead over Trump is four points in the two-way contest, 44%-40%, and five points in the head-to-head matchup, 48%-43% -- which is down from 11 points and 10 points, respectively, in last month’s NBC/WSJ poll released after the “Access Hollywood” video. But here’s the second story: The numbers inside the poll are incredibly stable and consistent with what we’ve seen all year:
The two demographics to watch tomorrow night: Latinos and college-educated whites. And if you want to see even more stability, here are the final numbers from our weekly online NBC|SurveyMonkey tracking poll: Clinton 47%, Trump 41%, Johnson 6%, Stein 3% -- which is unchanged from last week.
Another Comey bombshell: FBI clears Clinton
But while the race -- structurally -- has been incredibly stable, the storylines have been anything but. And yesterday we received yet another bombshell from FBI Director James Comey. NBC News: “FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the bureau won't change the conclusion it made in July after it examined newly revealed emails related to the Hillary Clinton probe. ‘Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,’ Comey wrote in a letter to 16 members of Congress.” More: “A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on [Anthony] Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.”
Trump on FBI outcome: “It’s a totally rigged system”
It’s difficult to quantify the impact that Comey’s initial letter, on Oct. 28, had on the Clinton-vs-Trump race, but it 1) certainly dominated the news environment for close to a week, 2) allowed Trump and Republicans to go on offense, and 3) forced Clinton and Democrats to play defense. But now Trump is saying that the FBI’s determination was part of a “rigged” result. “Right now, [Clinton] is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system,” Trump said on the campaign trail yesterday. “I've been saying it for a long time. You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days, you can’t do it, folks.” Two quick points here: One, there weren’t 650,000 Clinton-related emails; that was the number of total Weiner/Abedin emails on the computer. Two, computers certainly help to sort/verify information very quickly.
Clinton to release new two-minute TV ad speaking to camera
NBC’s Andrea Mitchell report that the Clinton campaign will release a two-minute TV ad of Clinton speaking to the camera, per a campaign official. The theme will be bringing the country together and reaching out to all voters including Trump supporters.
NBC/WSJ poll on the downballot situation
Dems hold a three-point lead on the congressional generic ballot: Yesterday’s national NBC/WSJ poll also found that Democrats were holding a three-point lead on which party likely voters preferred to Congress, 47%-44%, which is unchanged from mid-October. The poll also showed that voters, by a 51%-40%, prefer a Republican candidate who would serve to check and balance a President Clinton instead of a Democratic candidate to support her agenda.
First Read’s downballot race of the day: FL-7
Republican John Mica has been in Congress for 24 years, but recent redistricting is putting his long-held Orlando-area seat in peril. Stephanie Murphy, Vietnamese-American 38-year-old suburban mom and former Defense Department analyst, decided late in the cycle to challenge Mica after the Pulse nightclub shooting.
On the trail
Hillary Clinton campaigns in Pittsburgh, PA at noon ET, Allendale, MI at 4:00 pm ET, Philadelphia PA (with the president and first lady) at 7:30 pm ET, and finally Raleigh, NC at 11:45 pm ET… Donald Trump hits Sarasota, FL at 11:00 am ET, Raleigh at 3:00 pm ET, Scranton, PA at 5:30 pm ET, Manchester, NH at 8:00 pm ET, and Grand Rapids, MI at 11:00 pm ET… Mike Pence stumps in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania… Tim Kaine is in North Carolina and Virginia… President Obama campaigns in Ann Arbor, MI at 11:00 am ET and in Durham, NH at 3:00 pm ET… And Vice President Joe Biden is in Florida.

<https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-gop-canceling-gop-primaries-caucuses/story?id=65436462> dct:description """Nevada and South Carolina GOP cancel 2020 presidential nominating contests Arizona and Kansas are finalizing plans to opt out of primaries and caucuses.
Republican officials in South Carolina and Nevada voted Saturday to cancel their nominating contests in 2020, prompting President Donald Trump's long-shot primary opponents to rail against the stunning but not unprecedented move.
The votes, which come as Kansas and Arizona are also finalizing plans to forgo their GOP presidential primaries and caucuses, follows a broad effort by the Republican National Committee to give "undivided support" to the president - even passing an unprecedented loyalty pledge earlier this year before he's the party's official nominee.
"With no legitimate primary challenger and President Trump's record of results, the decision was made to save South Carolina taxpayers over $1.2 million and forgo an unnecessary primary,” Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina GOP, said in a statement. "President Trump and his administration have delivered for South Carolinians, and we look forward to ensuring that Republican candidates up and down the ballot are elected in 2020."
Late Saturday, the Nevada GOP voted to opt out of its caucus process, but the state party stopped short of nominating Trump. Instead, state party officials on the central committee will participate in an endorsement vote, which could bind the state's delegates to the president, at a later date.
"As the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, my job is to ensure not only President Trump’s victory in Nevada but also to elect more Republicans down the ballot. It would be malpractice on my part to waste money on a caucus to come to the inevitable conclusion that President Trump will be getting all our delegates in Charlotte," said Chairman Michael J. McDonald. "I am excited that our central committee has agreed with this proposal and voted to give us a way to bypass the caucus process."
Meanwhile, the Kansas Republican Party told ABC News on Friday that it is not planning for a caucus. Arizona is expected to make a decision later this month.
"It’s utter bulls---," former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., who launched a primary challenge during an exclusive interview on "This Week," told ABC News in an interview done Friday. "It’s undemocratic. It’s what a mob boss would do and that’s how Trump’s behaving right now."
Politico first reported on states' plans to drop the primaries.
Walsh blamed the president - even likening Trump to a king - and signaled his openness to legal action to fight back against the four states that are opting to forgo the primary process.
"This can’t—This can’t happen in America," he said. "Donald Trump is not a king. You cannot just eliminate elections. We are going to fight it in these four states. If they proceed and do this we are going to fight them with everything we've got legally."
"We're pursuing legal avenues to fight this," he added.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who declared earlier this year that he's running against Trump, struck a similar tone, saying the president "wishes to be crowned" instead of being "elected."
"Donald Trump, by turns arrogant and paranoid, has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to be crowned as President rather than elected," he told ABC News. "That might be fine in a monarchy, but we overthrew ours two centuries ago. The fact is that Mr. Trump and his handlers are keen to bypass the basic procedures of democracy as far as they can, because they know how awful he will look alongside candidates who are intelligent, experienced, and decent."
But an RNC official argued that shutting down primaries and caucuses is not new during an incumbent's re-election campaign. The official pointed to Republicans canceling eight primary contests in 1992 and 10 in 2004, and Democrats scrapping eight primaries and caucuses in 1996 and 10 in 2012, during former President Obama's re-election campaign.
"Republicans and Democrats alike have opted out ... in previous election cycles: Democrats did so in 1996 with then-incumbent President Bill Clinton, and again in 2012 when President Obama was in office; Republicans opted out in 2004 when President Bush was up for re-election," said Republican Party of Arizona Chairman Kelli Ward. "This is nothing new, despite the media's inauthentic attempt to portray it as such. Arizona Republicans are fired up to re-elect President Trump to a second term and will continue to work together to keep America—and Arizona—great."
The Arizona GOP will be weighing its decision at their upcoming quarterly executive committee meeting on Sept. 14, with one official telling ABC News, "it's likely" the primary will be canceled.
Arizona's Secretary of State's office confirmed that the Democratic Party did not participate in the presidential preference election in 1996 and 2012. But a spokesperson for the state Democratic Party told ABC News that it did hold caucuses during both Obama's and Clinton's re-election. In 2012, as the only candidate on the ballot, Obama received all 70 pledged delegates in the caucuses.
"Whether or not to hold a presidential primary is a decision made by our state executive committee every four years. There is strong precedent on the part of both parties to not hold a primary when they control the White House," said South Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
The Kansas GOP confirmed Friday it would not organize a caucus in 2020.
"The Kansas Republican Party will not organize a caucus for the 2020 election because President Trump is an elected incumbent from the Republican Party," said Shannon Golden, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party. "Every time an incumbent Republican has run for re-election, except in 1912 (when they went for Roosevelt instead of Taft), the Kansas Republican Party state convention adopted a resolution instructing all delegates to vote for the elected incumbent."
The RNC official also noted that state parties incur fees to pay for a primary or caucus, which is a big factor as they consider this decision. In Kansas, GOP Chairman Michael Kuckelman estimates it would cost the state party $250,000 to hold the caucus, money that could be used elsewhere, including to compete in tight races.
But two other early nominating states - Iowa and New Hampshire - are adamant that the decision to abandon the voting process in these states will not change anything for them.
The Iowa GOP told ABC News that their caucuses will continue as planned.
In New Hampshire, the secretary of state, a Democrat -- and not the state GOP -- runs the primary. Still, the spokesperson for the state Republican Party told ABC News: "Regardless of what other states do, New Hampshire's primary will always be the first in the nation.\"""" ;

<https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/movies/05pare.html> dct:description """Zaire ’74 almost didn’t happen. The festival was “a fool’s mission” from the start, said Stewart Levine, who produced it with the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. (They had been roommates in the 1960s at the Manhattan School of Music; Mr. Levine produced 15 albums for Mr. Masekela, including his hit single “Grazing in the Grass.”) When Mr. Levine heard about the boxing match in Zaire, he said by telephone from Los Angeles, “it just hit me — how about a music festival?”
He said, “I had a desire to hip the general audience to what wasn’t yet called world music. And I had this cockamamie idea about the festival, and everybody said yeah.”
Not everybody. The government of Zaire subsidized the boxing match; Zaire’s dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, wanted to burnish his country’s image. But Zaire would not finance the festival. So Mr. Levine rounded up backing from bankers in Liberia — their disgruntled representative is a character in “Soul Power” — and preparations began.
Then an injury forced Mr. Foreman to postpone the fight, separating the festival from the bout by six weeks and virtually eliminating the potential audience of international tourists. Mr. Levine had to decide overnight whether to cancel the festival.

But the performers had already been paid half their fees up front, and construction was under way. With contacts at ABC, Mr. Levine said, he prevailed on the sportscaster Howard Cosell to hold back for 24 hours the news that the fight had been postponed, lest the American musicians stay home. He was also lucky, he said, that it was Rosh Hashanah, and many of the performers’ managers were observing the holiday.
Then, as the charter flight was being loaded, James Brown arrived with 40,000 pounds of additional equipment — he had booked more shows in Africa — and refused to board unless it was on the flight with him, Mr. Levine said. The extra gear was somehow stuffed onto the plane. After a refueling stop, Mr. Levine said, “we touched the trees in Madrid on the runway. That’s how severely overweight the plane was.”
The production crew learned belatedly that Zaire’s electricity ran at 220 volts, not the 110 of their American equipment. Luckily, they discovered 110-volt generators that had been donated to Zaire by the United States Agency for International Development (and were little used due to the voltage disparity). The festival was on, more or less as planned; 80,000 people filled the stadium.

“It was interesting to watch the reaction of the mostly African audience,” said Mr. Withers, who in the film holds the crowd rapt singing “Hope She’ll Be Happier,” alone on acoustic guitar. “It’s like standing on the other side of the street watching your girlfriend walk down it and seeing how other people react to her.” The percussive, polyrhythmic salsa of Celia Cruz and the Fania All-Stars was the audience favorite, he said. And no wonder: Afro-Cuban rumba from a previous generation had strongly influenced the current Zairean pop, soukous. The film catches the conga player Ray Barretto in an impromptu jam session with African drummers.

Many of the performers and Mr. Ali himself are shown as starry-eyed about Africa. Mr. Withers, who was well-traveled after nine years in the Navy, was more levelheaded. “I felt like a very privileged person in an unprivileged setting,” he said. “This Mobutu guy, this dictator — that didn’t cheer me up, the disparity in the wealth. There seemed to be a large gap between the chosen people that were around him and everybody else.” But the scene at the hotel where invited guests were staying was singular, he said, “like Hyannisport meets Harlem meets Zaire.”
Zaire ’74 was shot by first-rate documentarians like Albert Maysles, who had made “Gimme Shelter” about the 1969 Altamont concert, and it was recorded in high-quality 16-track sound. But there was no money for postproduction. (The Liberians did end up paying the hotel more than $200,000, Mr. Levine said, because the festival producers had told all the musicians to feel free to put anything they pleased on their hotel tabs.) When it was over, the footage was stored by Mr. Gast, and, largely because of legal disputes, years went by before he completed “When We Were Kings.” Since that film focused on the boxing match, most of the music festival ended up on the cutting-room floor.
That rankled Mr. Levy-Hinte, who became a producer for feature films (“Laurel Canyon”) and documentaries (“Roman Polanski: Wanted & Desired”) for his company, Antidote International Films. He thought about the music footage for a decade, between other projects, and in 2006 decided to get serious about releasing it.
His plan was to put out concert DVDs of the festival’s performances, a fairly straightforward process. Then “I committed the original sin of filmmaking,” he said. “I fell in love with the material instead of following this rational business path.”
It cost about half a million dollars, including licensing the music, to make “Soul Power.” So far there’s no deal for a soundtrack album. The DVDs will be assembled “as soon as humanly possible,” Mr. Levy-Hinte said, though that may well be next year.
“The vast majority of the material has still not been used,” he added. “There may be a whole other movie in there.”""" ;

The range of candidates will also force Democratic voters to consider which electoral approach is best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, balancing questions of ideological purity with how to appeal to a wide range of demographic groups like white rural voters, suburban women, college students, and black and Latino Democrats in the South and the Sun Belt.
Ms. Warren, 69, is among the best-known Democrats seeking to take on Mr. Trump, whom she has denounced in the past as “a thin-skinned racist bully” and a “wannabe tyrant.” Mr. Trump, who has already announced his re-election campaign, frequently mocks her as “Pocahontas” because of her claims to Native American ancestry, a slur Native American groups have denounced as a racist epithet.
While Ms. Warren’s stinging attacks on Mr. Trump and Wall Street have helped make her a favorite of grass-roots liberals, she also faces challenges as a presidential candidate: controversy over a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage, skepticism from the party establishment and a lack of experience in a national race.
The editorial board of The Boston Globe, her hometown newspaper, recently urged her not to run for president, saying she had become “a divisive figure.” And some in her party believe she missed her best chance to run in 2016, when liberal activists urged her to challenge Hillary Clinton.
Two potential top-tier candidates who have run before, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, are eyeing 2020 and are expected to disclose their plans this winter. Yet both men carry political baggage and would be in their late 70s on Election Day 2020, and many Democrats say they want a fresh face as their next nominee.""" ;

<https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/08/31/coal-ash-epa-trump/> dct:description """“Newer, more affordable pollution control technologies and flexibility on the regulation’s phase-in will reduce pollution and save jobs at the same time,” Wheeler said.
AD
AD
Power plants represent the largest industrial source of toxic wastewater pollution around the country.
A senior EPA official on Monday said the updated rule would save the coal industry $140 million each year, and the agency estimated that the change would still reduce pollution by 1 million pounds annually compared to the 2015 rule because some plants would voluntarily adopt stricter controls than what the agency requires.
Beginning in 2018, power plants would have had to begin showing that they were using the most up-to-date technology to remove heavy metals from their wastewater and finalize these updates by 2023. But President Trump’s first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, said in the spring of 2017 that the agency would postpone those deadlines at the request of some energy firms.
AD
The new rule pushes the final deadline for compliance to 2025, and it exempts several dozen plants from stricter water pollution limits entirely, on the grounds that they will be retired between now and 2028.
Environmental groups swiftly condemned the changes, calling them a gift to the power industry and a shortsighted decision focused only on potential costs to companies, rather than on the benefits to wildlife and to people living near coal plants. They argued that the Obama administration’s rule was based on years of peer-reviewed studies, input from health experts and a mountain of public comments — and that stricter oversight is needed, given the amount of pollution generated by the plants.
AD
“The Trump administration is once again jeopardizing people’s health to give coal power industry lobbyists what they want,” Thom Cmar, an attorney with the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, said in a statement Monday. “The Trump administration’s rollback will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of pounds of pollutants contaminating sources of drinking water, lakes, rivers and streams every year.”
AD
Cmar said the group plans to challenge the rollback in court, as it has with numerous other Trump administration moves to cut federal regulation and oversight.
“Giving coal companies a free pass to dump more toxic heavy metals like mercury and arsenic into our waters is a travesty,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an email. “This shameless handout will allow greater amounts of these dangerous pollutants to be spewed directly into our waterways, threatening public health and pushing hundreds of aquatic endangered species, including salmon, sturgeon and hellbender salamanders, closer to extinction.”
AD
Coal industry executives, however, said the new pollution guidelines will be less costly while still safeguarding public health.
AD
“This new rule replaces a prime example of regulatory overreach that was specifically designed to stack the deck against the coal industry when compared with other fuels,” said Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association.
Quin Shea, vice president for environment, natural resources, and occupational safety and health at the Edison Electric Institute, said that power companies can meet the new standards without a problem, which is key to their “ability to continue providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to U.S. homes and businesses.”
Coal use has continued to plummet in recent years despite Trump’s efforts to aid the industry, in large part because of the persistently cheap price of natural gas.
AD
AD
According to data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in early August, 121 U.S. coal-fired power plants were repurposed to burn other types of fuels between 2011 and 2019 — the vast majority were converted to or replaced by natural gas-fired plants. In 2019, U.S. coal production was the lowest since 1978, when a coal miners’ strike halted most of the country’s coal production for months, according to the EIA. In addition, the agency has estimated that the country’s new electric generating capacity in 2020 will come primarily from wind and solar development.
In finalizing the 2015 rule, the Obama administration noted that federal standards limiting wastewater pollution by coal-fired power plants had remained unchanged for decades, and that states had largely left the problem unregulated.
At the same time, a coalition of energy companies, known as the Utility Water Act Group, has been adamant that the Obama-era regulation would impose heavy costs. Less than two months after Trump took office, the group filed a petition with the EPA, asking the agency to consider overhauling the rule.
AD
AD
“It will cause negative impacts on jobs due to the excessive costs of compliance — which were grossly underestimated by EPA — and regulatory burdens forcing plant closures,” the group wrote in its March 2017 appeal. “Those impacts are being, and will be, felt in communities around the country where those industries operate.”""" ;

<http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/pdt/reference/20080104/index.php?wfo=pdt> dct:description """On January 4, 2008, a strong low-pressure system created areas of heavy precipitation and/or damaging winds at several areas in the western United States. The central sea-level pressure offshore was around 958 mb (28.29 inches of mercury), similar to the surface low of a category 2 hurricane. The Sierra Nevada Mountains in California were experiencing extreme blizzard conditions at the time of the infrared satellite image shown below (10 am PST on January 4).
On the morning of January 4th, the low-pressure system was strengthening offshore of the Pacific Northwest coast. A very strong low-level jet of southerly wind at around 10,000 feet MSL was crossing the Cascades into eastern Oregon . At 10 am PST, a cold front was approaching the Oregon coast from the west; as depicted by the blue line on the NOAA Hydrometeorological Prediction Center surface analysis shown below.
2. WFO Pendleton Forecast Area Wind Storm
For Eastern Oregon and southeast Washington , the primary impact of the storm was damaging pre-frontal winds. For a list of storm reports in the Pendleton Weather Forecast Office area, click here.
A somewhat unusual aspect of this storm is that the strongest winds were not observed at higher elevations. Observations in the WFO Pendleton forecast area at elevations above 5000 feet reported peak wind gusts in the 40 to 60 mph range. (Round Mountain in central Oregon at elevation 5900 feet was the exception with a single gust to 70 mph.) Instead, the strongest winds were observed at relatively lower elevations. This is one indication that local terrain effects played an important role in the acceleration of wind during this event. The following table shows selected peak wind gusts from January 4.
Location Strongest Gust (mph) Strongest Sustained Wind (mph) Direction of Strongest Sustained Wind Elevation (feet) Walla Walla , WA Airport 78 55 South-Southeast 1204 La Grande, OR Airport 61 49 South 2717 Joseph , OR 85 47 South-Southeast 3984 Helix, OR 72 52 East 1896 Pendleton , OR Airport 53 35 Southeast 1493 John Day , OR Airport 71 48 South-Southeast 3697 Upper Wildhorse Mesonet Station (9 miles west of Tollgate, OR) 80 40 Southeast 3581
For additional observations from January 4, click here.
3. Record Low Sea-Level Pressure
Record and near record low sea-level pressures were observed on January 4. At the Walla Walla Airport (KALW) sea-level pressure was reduced to a minimum of 28.93 inches of mercury at 9:43 am . The previous record (since 1948), 28.95 inches of mercury, had occurred three times at KALW: on Oct 27, 1950 at 6 am, Dec. 5, 1951 between 1 and 3 am, and on Dec. 7, 1952 at 8 am. The sea-level pressure at KALW fell an impressive 9.5 mb (0.28 inches of mercury) over the 3 hours leading up to the record, and 26 mb over the previous 24-hour period. These low pressures along the foothills of the Blues were due to a combination of the low-pressure system offshore, a cold front moving across the interior Pacific Northwest, and the strong wind aloft moving across the Blue Mountains.
Station Lowest SLP (in. mercury) Time of Lowest SLP (PST) Highest Gust (mph) / Direction Time of Highest Gust (PST) KDLS 28.92 5:52 pm 24 / 200 9:01 pm KALW 28.93 9:43 am 78 / 170 9:50 am KPDT 28.95 3:30 pm 53 / 150 10:24 am KHRI 28.95 2:45 pm 47 / 170 2:09 pm KRDM 28.95 1:57 pm 44 / 180 12:13 pm
A Downslope Windstorm for the Northern Foothills of the Blues
Terrain effects were especially important during this event, and for the northern foothills of the Blue Mountains, local wind acceleration was created by a downslope wind storm. A zone of higher wind speed near the base of a mountain barrier on the downwind side characterizes Downslope windstorms. These types of wind storms are more common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, for example near Boulder, CO. On January 4th the greatest density of damage in the Pendleton forecast area was from a downslope wind storm over an area from Adams, Oregon northeast into the Walla Walla Valley . The Veteran's Affairs Medical Center in Walla Walla, WA reported 28 structures, 4 vehicles and 50 trees damaged just on their campus alone.
For additional photos from Walla Walla, WA, visit flickr.com. Please note some of these photographs may have copyright restrictions.
A 6-hour computer model forecast (from the NAM WRF model), valid at 10 am PST on January 4, shows several important features of the storm, including a large change in sea-level pressure oriented along the foothills of the Blue Mountains. (Sea-level pressure is depicted by the dashed yellow lines.) This 6-hour forecast of wind speed at 98 feet (30 meters) Above Ground Level (AGL) shows very strong winds over some of the areas that experienced damaging winds but also over other areas that did not. This model forecast also correctly captures higher sea-level pressures and lower wind speeds in the northwest portion of the lower Columbia Basin where a pool of colder air provided protection during the morning hours from the very strong south-southeast winds.
At Juniper Dunes (JUFW1), 33 miles northwest of KALW, wind gusts were 30 to 40 mph less then at KALW. And locations north and west of Juniper Dunes remained in a pool of cold air during the morning hours, which shielded them from the strong southeast winds. For example, the Pasco, WA airport (KPSC), 42 miles west-northwest of KALW, experienced light westerly winds during the morning hours. The table below shows the wind speeds at these three locations; note the colder temperatures at KPSC.
Station 4 am 5 am 6 am 7 am 8 am 9 am 10 am 11 am KALW Gust (MPH) Direction 39 SSE 45 SSE 55 SSE 36 SSE 55 SSE 55 SSE 75 SSE 78 SSE Temp (degF) 56 58 59 56 58 59 61 55 Juniper Dunes Gust (MPH) Direction 21 ESE 17 ESE 22 ESE 23 ESE 28 SE 34 SSE 34 SSE 44 S Temp (degF) 46 48 47 47 52 53 55 51 KPSC Gust (MPH) Direction 12 W 10 W 9 WSW 7 W 8 WNW 17 W 10 NW 14 NW Temp (degF) 30 30 31 31 31 32 34 37
5. Summary
In summary, the January 4 wind storm in eastern Oregon and southeast Washington is attributable to a powerful low-pressure system leading to record low sea-level pressures, along with the interaction of a very strong low-level jet and local complex terrain.""" ;

The Gulf of Mexico surface low tracked along the stationary boundary across the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys on the 8th and across New England on the 9th.

Meanwhile, the sub-tropical jet stream advected a deep moisture plume along and ahead of the surface system.
This water vapor image loop from 7 pm EST on January 6th through 7am EST on January 9th clearly shows the deep layered moisture being transported from the Gulf of Mexico toward the Northeast. In addition, the swirling "darker" imagery from New Mexico/Texas and lifting into the Mid-Atlantic is the upper atmospheric storm that delivers the heaviest precipitation to the northeast during the night of January 7th through midday on January 9th.
Click to enlarge
Steady and heavy precipitation overspread northern New York, northern New England and southeast Canada on the night of the 7th and continued through the 9th with precipitation amounts of several inches observed during this period. Some of these tremendous precipitation amounts set daily records for January 8th (Burlington ~ 2.11" and Massena ~ 1.87").
However, the most devastating and overwhelming aspect of this tremendous precipitation event was the type of precipitation - freezing rain as surface temperatures remained primarily below freezing, actually in the 20s for the most part with some minor fluctuations.
Click to enlarge
Storm total precipitation for the event from NWS Burlington spotters, Cooperative Weather Observers and NWS/FAA sites ranged from around 1.5" in southern Vermont to amounts exceeding 6" in extreme northern Vermont.
The heaviest precipitation occurred across northern New York and the border counties in Vermont. There was some missing data in northern New York, thus most of the region exceeded 4 inches of precipitation.
Click to enlarge
Freezing rain is a meteorological phenomena that is strongly elevation dependent, but is opposite of standard atmospheric conditions. In a standard atmosphere, the surface of the earth is warmer than the atmosphere above it, thus the temperature cools with height. Therefore in marginally cold conditions, precipitation originates as snow in the cloud and will fall as snow through much of its travels to the surface, then turn to a cold rain or wet snow in the valleys as the surface temperature is above freezing, with accumulating snow in the higher elevations where the temperature is below freezing. The opposite is true with a freezing rain event.
Precipitation will form as snow or rain in the cloud and then fall toward the surface through a relatively mild layer that melts the precipitation into rain until it encounters a shallow cold sub-freezing layer near the surface, where the precipitation still remains as rain, but freezes on contact with various objects. Cold air is denser than mild air, thus in a mountain or river valley, the valley floor is colder than the neighboring higher terrain.
Click to enlarge
A 3-hourly increment time lapse loop from 7 pm EST on January 6th through 7am EST on January 9th shows the cold air drainage across the St. Lawrence and Champlain Valleys where temperatures remained primarily below freezing.
Meanwhile, temperatures were just above freezing for most of the event elsewhere across Vermont and northern New York. Also, temperatures were in the 40s and 50s along the New York-Pennsylvania border with several failed attempts to move northward toward the North Country.

The freezing rain with this event was concentrated in the St. Lawrence and Champlain Valleys of Canada, New York and Vermont due to the continued advection of cold, dense air from eastern Quebec down to St. Lawrence River valley into these locations.
Ice had already accumulated to a half inch in the Champlain Valley and up to an inch in the St. Lawrence Valley for several days preceding this heavy precipitation. Therefore, the heavy accumulation and build-up of ice from the 7th through the 9th had devastating and life-threatening consequences across the region.""" ;

United States presidential election of 1964 , American presidential election held on November 3, 1964, in which Democratic Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Republican Barry Goldwater in one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.
The campaign
The 1964 election occurred just less than one year after the assassination of Pres. John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Johnson, Kennedy’s vice president, was quickly sworn in, and in the subsequent days Kennedy’s presumed assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was murdered. To American and foreign observers alike, this created a disturbing image of disorder and violence in the United States. In the tempestuous days after the assassination, Johnson helped to calm national hysteria and ensure continuity in the presidency. On November 27 he addressed a joint session of Congress and, invoking the memory of the martyred president, urged the passage of Kennedy’s legislative agenda, which had been stalled in congressional committees. Johnson placed greatest importance on Kennedy’s civil rights bill, which became the focus of his efforts during the first months of his presidency.

Central to the 1964 campaign was race relations, particularly with the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Johnson signed into law in July and which was intended to end discrimination based on race, colour, religion, or national origin. For most of the period since the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the Democratic Party dominated what came to be known as the “Solid South,” easily winning Southern states in most presidential elections. Johnson’s support of civil rights legislation, however, began the process that would eventually push the South consistently into the Republican column.

Barry Goldwater, a U.S. senator from Arizona, won several key primary victories against Nelson Rockefeller in a bitter contest and was nominated on the first ballot at the Republican convention in July in San Francisco, California, just two weeks after the Civil Rights Act had been signed. Goldwater had voted against the act, and he was a staunch anticommunist and a strong proponent of reduced federal activity in all fields. Goldwater selected Rep. William E. Miller of New York as his running mate. Goldwater’s nomination was not without controversy, since many Republican moderates considered Goldwater outside the party mainstream; at the convention Rockefeller received a loud chorus of boos as he spoke. Indeed, a poll in June had indicated that more than three-fifths of rank-and-file Republicans favoured William Scranton, governor of Pennsylvania, for the party nomination.

During the spring Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, an opponent of racial integration, had entered primaries in a number of Northern states in an effort to demonstrate the existence of a Northern white anti-civil rights “backlash” vote. Wallace won 30 percent or more of the Democratic vote in the Wisconsin, Indiana, and Maryland primaries.
At the Democratic convention in late August in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Johnson was renominated, along with Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey as his running mate. The convention, however, was the scene of a major civil rights controversy. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), a largely African American group, challenged the credentials of the all-white Mississippi regular Democratic delegation (who had been elected in a discriminatory poll). MFDP member and black activist Fannie Lou Hamer—who earlier had famously declared, “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired”—made an impassioned plea to the credentials committee:

If the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings, in America?”
A compromise was worked out for the MFDP to take two seats, but the MFDP refused, and eventually most of the official Mississippi Democratic Party delegation left the convention, since they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater.
Goldwater made moral leadership a major theme of his campaign. In a move widely interpreted as an appeal to the “backlash,” Goldwater placed heavy emphasis during his campaign on lawlessness and crime in big cities. The Republican Party made little effort to court the vote of African Americans, and black voters would move in great numbers to the Democrats, providing Johnson his margin of victory in states such as Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia.
Although foreign affairs had not been a central issue in much of the campaign, American military involvement in Vietnam did weigh heavily on Johnson. During the primary campaign in California, Rockefeller cast the conservative Goldwater as a risky choice, asking in a mailing, “Who do you want in the room with the H-bomb button?” Resurrecting Rockefeller’s line of attack, the Democrats produced the so-called Daisy ad, one of the most powerful television advertisements in presidential election history, which showed a little girl in a field picking flower petals. As she counts up, a countdown begins that leads to a nuclear mushroom cloud, an allusion to Goldwater’s past statements that nuclear bombs might be used tactically in Vietnam. The mushroom cloud was then followed by Johnson’s voice, saying that “these are the stakes” in the election. The ad ran only once but synthesized in many people’s minds the view that Goldwater was too extreme for the presidency.
When the votes were cast on November 3, Johnson defeated Goldwater handily, winning by more than 15 million votes and capturing 61 percent of the vote. The electoral vote domination was even greater; Johnson won 44 states and Washington, D.C., for 486 electoral votes, while Goldwater won 6 states accounting for 52 electoral votes. Goldwater did poorly in traditionally Republican areas, but, largely on the basis of Goldwater’s opposition to the civil rights bill and his promotion of states’ rights, he carried Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, in addition to his home state of Arizona.

Results of the American presidential election, 1968. Sources: Electoral and popular vote totals based on data from the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, 4th ed. (2001).
Early in 1968, Michigan Republican Gov. George Romney announced his candidacy for the presidency. Many believed New York’s governor, Nelson Rockefeller , might also be a challenger, and George Wallace , former Democratic governor of Alabama and a segregationist during his tenure , began hinting of his interest in the office. Peace factions and black militants talked of nominating their own candidates, and a rerun of the four-way race of 1948 seemed possible.
The 1966 elections reinstated the Republicans as a large minority in Congress, and social legislation slowed, competing with the Vietnam War for the available money. Despite the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965), many African Americans became disenchanted with progress on civil rights. Thus, a “ Black Power ” movement arose, hitting into Johnson’s popularity even among African Americans. A general crime increase and sporadic violence in the cities raised apprehension in white communities . A call for “law and order” was the response, and it became not only an issue but, many believed, a code word for African American repression.
The run-up to the 1968 election was transformed in 1967 when Minnesota’s Democratic senator, Eugene J. McCarthy , challenged Democratic Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson on his Vietnam War policies. Johnson had succeeded to the presidency in 1963, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy , and had been overwhelmingly reelected in 1964. Early in his term he was immensely popular, but U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which had escalated invisibly during the presidential administrations of both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Kennedy, became highly visible with rapidly increasing U.S. death tolls, and, as the war’s unpopularity mounted, so did Johnson’s.
Primaries
In this setting, McCarthy, whose criticism of the administration on its Vietnam policies had become increasingly caustic, announced his candidacy for president and entered the New Hampshire primary—the first of the presidential primaries. Rockefeller denied that he was a candidate but said that he would accept a draft; 30 Republican leaders endorsed him. At this time Nixon, who had been Eisenhower’s vice president and who had narrowly lost to Kennedy in 1960, declared that new leadership could end the war; he announced his candidacy and entered the New Hampshire primary.

McCarthy was the only major Democrat on the New Hampshire ballot, but, shortly before the March 12 voting, Democratic regulars, alarmed by the effectiveness of McCarthy’s legion of young amateur campaign workers, mounted a desperate write-in campaign for the president. Johnson won 48 percent of the vote, but McCarthy, with 42 percent, won 20 of the 24 delegates. Nixon won the Republican primary; Romney, with polls indicating that he had little hope of winning, had withdrawn from the primary and the presidential race.
A few days later Robert F. Kennedy announced that he would enter the race on the Democratic side. On March 31 President Johnson stunned the country by announcing an end to the bombing of most of North Vietnam—and his decision not to seek reelection. Two days later McCarthy won a somewhat diluted triumph over the president in the Wisconsin primary.
The following Thursday, April 4, African American civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Grief and shock among African Americans turned to anger, which found expression in rioting and violence in more than 100 cities, leading many white voters to look more closely at Wallace, who was stressing “law and order” and promising to be on the ballot in 50 states.
After King’s funeral, McCarthy, unopposed, won a preferential primary but no delegates in Pennsylvania. However, he took all the delegates in the Massachusetts primary. The upset Republican winner in Massachusetts was Rockefeller, for whom a hasty write-in campaign had been contrived. Rockefeller beat Gov. John Volpe, who was on the ballot, and Richard Nixon, who was not, and reversed his decision not to run.

Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, took four weeks to assess his chances after Johnson’s withdrawal. Humphrey then declared his candidacy and hurriedly assembled an organization to hunt delegates. In the Indiana primary Kennedy defeated both McCarthy and Indiana Gov. Roger Branigan. He also won in Washington, D.C., and trounced McCarthy in Nebraska. In Oregon McCarthy won his only primary victory over an active opponent who was on the ballot, handing Kennedy his first election defeat and winning 45 percent of the vote to Kennedy’s 39 percent. The next week, on June 4, Kennedy scored a solid victory over McCarthy in California, but shortly after midnight, as the votes were still being counted, Kennedy was fatally shot.

Nixon, meanwhile, won every Republican primary he entered; the Massachusetts write-in effort for Rockefeller was his only reverse. Rockefeller intensified his efforts and in mid-July finished a 44-state tour as his $3 million advertising campaign reached a peak.

Humphrey entered no primaries, but he was able to gain enough delegates in those states without primaries to give him apparent control over the convention. However, dissenters were taking an increasingly hard line against him and the administration. To ardent liberals, Humphrey—until recently denounced by rightists as a dangerous radical—was becoming the very image of the establishment.""" ;

The vice president’s announcement came after months of assessing the political landscape and consulting with family, and it eliminated the possibility of a three-way scrum for Democratic primary votes. The decision leaves Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent running in the Democratic primary, as Mrs. Clinton’s chief rival.
“Unfortunately, I believe we’re out of time, the time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination,” Mr. Biden said from the White House Rose Garden while flanked by his wife, Jill Biden, and President Barack Obama.
Mr. Biden would have competed directly with Mrs. Clinton for support, and his decision removes a threat of Democratic fundraisers and voters defecting to a popular vice president or, at the very least, splitting their allegiance between the party stalwarts.
“It’s ultimately good news [for Mrs. Clinton] and it’s money she’s not going to have to spend on a primary,” said Bill Burton, a former Obama campaign aide. “She’ll have to fight with Bernie but, hopefully, it will be less expensive.”""" ;

Joe Biden has hovered at or above 50% support in daily polls conducted since the first week of June, while President Donald Trump has polled between 42% and 45% since May.
According to the latest daily tracking from Morning Consult Political Intelligence conducted Sept. 5-7, Biden leads Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters nationwide, 50 percent to 44 percent. Biden’s numbers — superior to Hillary Clinton’s position against Trump at this point four years ago , with fewer undecided voters than in 2016 — look more like his standing in May and early June than his 8- to 9-point daily leads throughout much of the summer.
Former Vice President Joe Biden’s substantial polling lead over President Donald Trump has narrowed in recent days, though the Democratic nominee maintains an advantage over the incumbent nationally and in key battleground states as the contest enters its final eight weeks.
The tightening at this moment, which traditionally marks the kickoff of the fall campaign season, is statistically significant but numerically modest, underscoring the relative stability of the race and durability of the Democrat’s edge. Biden has hovered at or above 50 percent since the first week of June, and Trump — who has never led Biden nationally in Morning Consult’s tracking — has polled between 42 percent and 45 percent among likely voters since May. Each of the daily data points is based on a 3-day moving average of responses and has a 1-point margin of error.
Trump’s best national numbers came in late May, before a post-Memorial Day surge of COVID-19 cases and the national unrest sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. The twin crises brought voter sentiment to its lowest point of Trump’s presidency, and coincided with an increase in Biden’s national lead.
In recent weeks, another round of protests — this time over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. — have dominated the headlines as coronavirus cases have declined along with voter concern over the pandemic. While Biden has a trust advantage with voters on both race relations and public safety concerns, the contest’s shift to issues of law and order has helped to move the national dialogue away from the coronavirus pandemic, a topic that’s been a political loser for Trump and was a prominent subject during the Democratic National Convention.
Since a late July foundering, Trump’s net approval rating on the virus — the share who approve of his handling of its spread minus the share who disapprove — has increased 9 points, with 40 percent now approving and 54 percent disapproving, according to a Sept. 2-6 Morning Consult survey of 1,965 registered voters, which has a 2-point margin of error.
And compared with a Morning Consult poll conducted July 31 through Aug. 2, the share of voters who label the pandemic a “severe health risk” in their communities has fallen 7 points, to 29 percent, while the share who dubbed it a severe risk in the United States fell by 9 points to 57 percent — its lowest point since the first week of June.""" ;

Results of the American presidential election, 1936Sources: Electoral and popular vote totals based on data from the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, 4th ed. (2001).
Despite Roosevelt’s widespread popularity, his policies had evoked stiff criticism , including from former supporters. Sen. Huey Long of Louisiana, an early supporter of the president, had become dissatisfied with Roosevelt’s policies. Long’s Share-the-Wealth program (“every man a king”) was tempting to a depression-shocked public. A private poll in the spring of 1935 indicated that if Long could unite the various nationwide radical movements, he might carry up to four million votes in the 1936 election, thus wielding a balance of power between the two major parties and representing a threat to Roosevelt’s reelection. Long, however, died in September 1935. Father Charles E. Coughlin was also an early supporter of Roosevelt who turned on the president. The “radio priest” began expressing reactionary views that were increasingly anti-New Deal and containing anti-Semitic (and anticommunist) rhetoric . Coughlin, however, was Canadian-born and thus ineligible for the presidency, but with a listenership in the tens of millions he could wield great sway.
Surmising that additional action was required, Roosevelt introduced a “Second New Deal” in 1935 that included the Social Security Act and the Works Progress Administration . In addition, the Democratic Congress also passed a major tax revision—labeled by its opponents as a “soak-the-rich” tax—that raised tax rates for persons with large incomes and for large corporations.
In 1932, amid the Great Depression , Roosevelt had won a landslide victory over incumbent Herbert Hoover , ending 12 years of Republican rule. After assuming the office, he took quick and decisive action, pursuing the New Deal , a broad array of measures intended to achieve economic recovery, to provide relief to the millions of poor and unemployed, and to reform aspects of the economy that Roosevelt believed had caused the collapse. The measures, passed in his first hundred days in office, had produced a limited degree of recovery by the fall of 1934, and in that year’s midterm elections the Democrats built on their already substantial majorities. Although the New Deal had alienated conservatives , including many businessmen, most Americans supported Roosevelt’s programs.
The nominations and campaign
The Republicans were in disarray politically from their devastating loss in 1932. In 1936 they rallied at their national convention, held in Cleveland June 9–12, in favour of Landon, considered a moderate progressive, who won 984 of the 1,003 delegate votes. The delegates unanimously ratified Landon’s choice of running mate, Frank Knox, publisher of the Chicago Daily News and a critic of the New Deal (in a surprise, Knox would go on to be appointed in 1940 by Roosevelt as secretary of the U.S. Navy). The Republican platform was as much anti-Roosevelt as it was pro-Republican. It began:
Landon, Alfred M. Alf Landon. Courtesy of the Kansas State Historical Society
America is in peril. The welfare of American men and women and the future of our youth are at stake. We dedicate ourselves to the preservation of their political liberty, their individual opportunity and their character as free citizens, which today for the first time are threatened by Government itself. For three long years the New Deal Administration has dishonored American traditions and flagrantly betrayed the pledges upon which the Democratic Party sought and received public support. The powers of Congress have been usurped by the President.
The integrity and authority of the Supreme Court have been flouted.
The rights and liberties of American citizens have been violated.… To a free people these actions are insufferable.
At the Democratic convention, held two weeks later in Philadelphia, the party nominated Roosevelt and his vice president, John Nance Garner, by acclamation. Accepting the nomination in person (as he had done in 1932), Roosevelt proclaimed that “this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.” In facing the Great Depression, the president focused on the challenge before him in warlike terms:
Franklin D. Roosevelt Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (Digital File Number: cph 3c17121)
In this world of ours in other lands, there are some people, who, in times past, have lived and fought for freedom, and seem to have grown too weary to carry on the fight. They have sold their heritage of freedom for the illusion of a living. They have yielded their democracy. I believe in my heart that only our success can stir their ancient hope. They begin to know that here in America we are waging a great and successful war. It is not alone a war against want and destitution and economic demoralization. It is more than that; it is a war for the survival of democracy. We are fighting to save a great and precious form of government for ourselves and for the world. I accept the commission you have tendered me. I join with you. I am enlisted for the duration of the war.
The general election was not competitive, as Roosevelt had the firm support of farmers, labourers, and the poor. He faced the equally firm opposition of conservatives, but the epithets hurled at him from the right merely helped to unify his following. Landon could do little to stem the Roosevelt tide. Landon received fewer than 17 million votes to Roosevelt’s more than 27 million, and Roosevelt carried every state except Maine and Vermont.

<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html> dct:description """LAWRENCE, Mass. — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts formally announced her 2020 presidential bid Saturday, calling for “fundamental change” on behalf of working people and arguing that President Trump is “just the latest and most extreme symptom of what’s gone wrong in America.”
Speaking on a clear, chilly day against a backdrop of old red brick mill buildings at the site of one of the nation’s most famous labor strikes, she said workers now, like workers then, had had enough. She said that replacing Mr. Trump, whose administration she called “the most corrupt in living memory,” was only the first step in fighting back against a system tilted in favor of the wealthy.
“It won’t be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration,” Ms. Warren said. “We can’t afford to just tinker around the edges — a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change.”
The selection of Lawrence was symbolic: In 1912, a historic labor strike was started by a group of women at Everett Mill, where Ms. Warren made her announcement. The senator drew on the strike as a story of women, many of them immigrants, taking on a stacked system and triumphing by gaining raises, overtime and other benefits.""" ;

Still, no fundamental differences were voiced by the two principal candidates on the subject. Both favoured a vigorous defense program and all possible aid to the United Kingdom “short of war.” Roosevelt had the advantage of position, which enabled him to counter verbal attacks with dramatic action—as when he announced that 50 over-age destroyers would be given to Britain in exchange for the lease of certain sites for naval bases (a plan that later became the lend-lease program). Although Willkie criticized the manner in which it was arranged, he did not disapprove of the substance of the program. Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. Subscribe today On domestic issues there was almost as little avowed disagreement. Willkie declared himself in favour of retaining the main features of the New Deal legislation, promising only that, if he was elected, he would give it more efficient and impartial execution. By and large, the newspaper editorial pages lined up in favour of Willkie, including many that had previously backed Roosevelt. Still, a general disinclination to change leadership amid crisis probably weighed heavily on the minds of voters—much more so than the perceived deep-seated opposition to a third term for a president. In the end, Roosevelt won 54.7 percent of the vote and 449 electoral votes, a landslide by any definition but lower than the totals he had amassed in 1932 and 1936. Willkie received 44.8 percent and 82 electoral votes, carrying 10 states: Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont. Roosevelt, Franklin D.

Results of the American presidential election, 1960. Sources: Electoral and popular vote totals based on data from the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, 4th ed. (2001).
United States presidential election of 1960 , American presidential election held on November 8, 1960, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon . Kennedy thus became the first Roman Catholic and the youngest person ever elected president . Kennedy was also the first president born in the 20th century.
Kennedy and Humphrey were the only major Democratic contenders to enter presidential primaries in 1960. Their first significant primary was in Wisconsin in April. Both Humphrey and Kennedy campaigned energetically in that state, which borders Humphrey’s home state of Minnesota. Kennedy won easily and was especially strong in Milwaukee and other areas where there were large numbers of Catholic voters. A month later Kennedy all but eliminated Humphrey from consideration by defeating him in West Virginia, a heavily Protestant state, proving that he could win in a state with few Catholics.
Throughout the primaries and the fall campaign, Kennedy’s religion was a dominant issue. He would become only the second Roman Catholic ever to be nominated for president by a major party (the first was Democratic Gov. Al Smith of New York, who lost to Herbert Hoover in 1928 ). Some Protestant ministers and prominent laymen expressed fears that a Catholic president would be under the domination of the pope and would not always be free to act in the best interests of the country, charges which Kennedy denied.
On the Republican side there was little doubt that their nominee would be Nixon. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York , who had indicated late in 1959 that he might seek the Republican nomination, withdrew in late December in the face of almost total opposition by Republican Party leaders. Nixon entered some of the primaries, but only to demonstrate his vote-getting abilities. He never faced any serious opposition.
The Republican platform promised to continue and to improve upon the programs of the Eisenhower administration. Although there were some signs of dissatisfaction with the administration because of its failure to pursue aggressive action in such as areas as military programs, aid to depressed areas, and space exploration , it was generally agreed that Eisenhower’s prestige was as high as it had ever been and that the president’s support was a distinct advantage to Nixon.
Kennedy went to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles , held July 11–15, 1960, as the front-runner for the nomination, with some 600 delegates of the 761 needed for nomination secured. Johnson, however, hoped to wrest the nomination from Kennedy. Nevertheless, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot, with 806 votes. Kennedy then surprised most of his supporters by picking Johnson as his vice presidential running mate. The selection was generally interpreted as a move to hold the South, where opposition to Kennedy’s religion was strong and where the traditional Democratic leanings of the voters were changing. The party platform adopted at Los Angeles promised to expand the country’s defense and foreign aid programs. It also committed the Democratic Party, controversially, to civil rights . In his acceptance speech, Kennedy said the American people needed to be prepared to sacrifice in the years ahead. There were, he said, stimulating “new frontiers” to be crossed by the United States.
Scenes from the 1960 Democratic National Convention, which nominated as candidate for president U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy, who, in his acceptance speech, spoke of his hopes for a “New Frontier.”
The general election campaign
Presidential posturing began in earnest when the U.S. Congress reconvened in August, after the political conventions had been concluded. Both nominees were principal figures in the session, which was held in a politically charged atmosphere. As vice president, Nixon presided over the Senate. He also was a key figure in determining Republican strategy in a Congress that was controlled by the Democrats. As a senator from Massachusetts and as an author of the minimum-wage bill that was one of the principal measures to be acted upon during the session, Kennedy had an important stake in seeing to it that the achievements of the session were substantial.
John F. Kennedy campaign button Button from John F. Kennedy's 1960 U.S. presidential campaign. Americana/Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
The legislative achievements of Congress were mixed, but, by the time the traditional presidential campaign season kicked off on Labor Day in September, Nixon’s and Kennedy’s responsibilities in Congress were all but forgotten. At the time, the presidential campaign was the longest and the most intensive ever held in the United States. Crisscrossing the country on planes, trains, automobiles, and buses, Nixon and Kennedy were speaking, shaking hands, and conferring with politicians from coast to coast for most of September, for all of October, and for the seven days of November preceding the election.
Kennedy tackled the election issue of his Catholicism in a speech to a group of Protestant ministers in Houston. In that speech, on September 12, he declared:
I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish—where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source—where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials—and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.
An unprecedented series of four television debates between the two nominees constituted the highlight of the campaign. A provision of the Federal Communications Act had been suspended by Congress earlier in the year to permit the networks to broadcast the debates without having to provide equal time for candidates of minor parties. Although the debates were sometimes compared to the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas (see also Lincoln-Douglas debates), they were more in the nature of joint press conferences, with reporters asking questions. They did, however, provide voters with an opportunity to compare the two candidates. Although Nixon showed a mastery of the issues, it is generally agreed that Kennedy, with his relaxed and self-confident manner, as well as his good looks (in contrast to Nixon’s “five o’clock shadow”), benefited the most from the exchanges. An estimated 85–120 million Americans watched one or more of the debates.
Kennedy and Nixon both used set speeches in their public appearances. Kennedy said that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in the race for world supremacy and that the United States must “do better.” He pointed to the regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba—“just ten minutes by jet from the United States.” Kennedy also stressed the need for programs to deal with unemployment in chronically depressed areas and for more rapid U.S. economic growth. Nixon, the first presidential nominee to campaign in every state, emphasized that he would carry on the basic policies of the Eisenhower administration, but he also indicated that he would improve upon them in such areas as welfare programs, foreign aid, and defense. Eisenhower, who went on a “nonpolitical” inspection tour of the country in mid-October, took an active part in the last week of the campaign, when Eisenhower and Nixon appeared together in New York City. Until then, however, the president had seemed to stay in the background.
When voters went to cast their ballots on November 7, the contest was close. In the electoral college, Kennedy captured 303 votes (34 more than was required to win), while Nixon won 219. The 14 unpledged electors in Alabama and Mississippi and 1 pledged elector in Oklahoma cast their votes for Sen. Harry F. Byrd, a Democrat from Virginia. Kennedy eked out a narrow victory in the popular vote, defeating Nixon by just under 117,000 votes. Overall, Kennedy won 49.7 percent to Nixon’s 49.5 percent. Kennedy thus became the third person elected president in the 20th century without winning a majority of the popular vote (joining Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and Harry S. Truman in 1948; in 1968 Nixon would become the fourth person in the 20th century to win the presidency without a majority). The popular vote was the closest since 1884, when Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Republican James G. Blaine by only about 24,000 votes.
Citing voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas, many observers questioned whether Kennedy had legally won those states, and some prominent Republicans—including Eisenhower—even urged Nixon to contest the results. He chose not to, however, declaring:
I could think of no worse example for nations abroad, who for the first time were trying to put free electoral procedures into effect, than that of the United States wrangling over the results of our presidential election, and even suggesting that the presidency itself could be stolen by thievery at the ballot box.
Nixon’s supporters and critics alike, both then and later, praised him for the dignity and unselfishness with which he handled defeat and the suspicion that vote fraud had cost him the presidency.

<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/biden-dominates-electoral-map-here-s-how-race-could-tighten-n1236001> dct:description """WASHINGTON — When you’re leading a presidential race nationally by double digits, you’re set to exceed 300 electoral votes.
And that’s where we have Joe Biden in our first battleground map of 2020, where the Democrat is ahead in states like Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin, and where the race is essentially tied in Georgia, Iowa and Texas.
Our map— based on public and private polling, as well as conversations with Democratic and Republican strategists watching the race — shows Biden standing at 334 electoral votes, President Trump is at 125 electoral votes, and 79 electoral votes are in the Toss up category.
But an important caveat: This is where the Biden-versus Trump race stands right now, and if/when the contest begins to tighten, we’ll readjust our map. (And see below on exactly how the race can get closer.)
Solid D: California, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington (130 electoral votes).
Likely D: Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia (82).
Lean D: Arizona, Florida, Maine-02, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin (122).
Toss Up: Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska-02, Ohio, Texas (79).
Lean R: N/A (0).
Likely R: Alaska, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Utah (56).
Solid R: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wyoming (69).
(Our definitions: Solid is where the candidate has a 15-point or higher lead; Likely is where the candidate is ahead by 10 to 15 points; Lean is where it’s within or slightly outside the margin of error; and TOSS UP is where it’s a virtual tie.)
Now not all Likely, Lean and Toss Up states are created equally. Here are the Lean D states in order of most likely to go Biden’s way to least likely: Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Maine-02 and Florida.
Here are the Toss Up states in order from mostly likely to go Biden’s way versus Trump’s: Nebraska-02, Ohio, Iowa, Georgia and Texas.
And we have states like Colorado and Virginia that fit between Likely D and Lean D, but we’re putting in Likely D for now.
How Republicans can bring soft GOP voters back home
But if you wanted to see how states like Georgia, Iowa and Texas could easily move from Toss Up to Lean R — and also how Lean D states like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Florida could move into Toss Up — just look at the current GOP advertising.
Bottom line: The GOP is trying to bring soft Republicans back home.
Note the Trump advertising tying Biden to Bernie Sanders, AOC and Ilhan Omar.
Or the Trump Super PAC ads claiming that Biden wants to raise taxes.
Or that fact that the main GOP Super PAC for Senate races announced that $17 million of the $21 million it’s spending in its upcoming buy are slated for Georgia, Iowa and Montana — all trying to bring Republican back home.
And whether or not Republicans are successful here is the difference between our current map and something that looks closer to 2016’s.

2020 Vision: It’s Primary Thursday in Tennessee
Voters are voting today in Tennessee, where the marquee contest is the GOP Senate primary in the race to replace retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.
Bill Hagerty, a former private equity exec who most recently served as Trump’s ambassador to Japan, was long seen as the shoo-in for the seat; Trump endorsed him almost immediately, even before Hagerty made his own campaign official.
But surgeon and first-generation American Manny Sethi appears to have surged in the closing weeks of a race that has become increasingly nasty and personal. Public polling has been scarce; Sethi’s internal numbers have shown a closer race than Hagerty’s, but both campaigns have been ratcheting up negative attacks.
In a sign of how the GOP tide has turned against its 2012 presidential nominee, Sethi and his allies have lambasted Hagerty as “another Romney” because of his past role as national finance chair for Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign. (Hagerty later served as Trump’s Tennessee Victory Chair in 2016, and he has now distanced himself from Romney – even labeling him “weak-kneed” in a recent ad.)
Sethi’s ads have also included warnings about “left-wing mobs” and an “illegal immigrant invasion.” Hagerty’s ads have included one featuring a veteran who says he doesn’t trust Sethi to stop flag-burners because he once donated to “a left-wing group that is bankrolling the rioters.” (That’s a reference to a $50 donation Sethi’s wife says she made in 2008 via commonly-used online fundraising platform ActBlue.)
The contest has split Republican officials, with both Ted Cruz and Rand Paul backing Sethi, while Hagerty boasts support from Trump and Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marsha Blackburn and Tom Cotton.
Bottom line: This isn’t Lamar Alexander’s or Bob Corker’s Republican Party in Tennessee anymore.
Ad watch from Ben Kamisar
Today’s Ad Watch comes from MTP Daily’s Ed Demaria, who flagged this new Biden spot running in Florida.
The spot, running in Orlando and Tampa per Advertising Analytics, is set in The Villages, the mega-retirement home typically seen as GOP-leaning. In it, a grandmother laments how the coronavirus pandemic has prevented her from seeing her grandchildren, expressing frustration that President Trump’s response hasn’t contained the virus.
Still no deal
There’s still no deal on Capitol Hill on the coronavirus relief negotiations. And while there’s still a goal to reach a compromise by Friday, it’s not entirely assured they’ll make it, NBC News’ Hill team reports.
“I feel optimistic that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But how long that tunnel is remains to be seen,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters after a Wednesday afternoon meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and White House negotiators Steve Mnuchin and Mark Meadows.
Meadows told reporters that there will be no deal by Friday if there aren’t agreements made on “major issues”. “This is not a fine wine, it doesn’t improve with time,” Meadows said.
So what are they still working out? Per our Hill team, negotiators have circled around proposals to extend the federal unemployment benefit to $400 per week (down from the $600 people had been getting and in the House Democrats’ bill, but up from the $200 in the Senate Republicans’ bill) and whether to extend the eviction moratorium through December.

The Democrats held their convention in Chicago two weeks later. The Democratic National Convention was marked by disarray, particularly between delegates who supported civil rights (largely from Northern states) and those opposed (primarily from Southern states). A requirement was adopted that the delegations pledge to support the eventual nominee and the party platform. A number of candidates vied for the nomination, including Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee and Sen. Richard Russell of Georgia . Adlai E. Stevenson, the governor of Illinois, had refused to seek the nomination, but he was drafted by the convention as a compromise choice and was nominated on the third ballot. He chose as his running mate a Southerner, Sen. John Sparkman of Alabama . In contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats pledged to repeal the Taft-Hartley Act and called for the continuation of policies pursued by Truman and his predecessor as president, Franklin D. Roosevelt . There was also support for continuing the Korean War.
The Republican National Convention was held in Chicago , July 7–11. After a bitter fight with Taft supporters, Eisenhower won the nomination on the first ballot. Eisenhower selected as his running mate Sen. Richard M. Nixon of California, who had strong anticommunist credentials. Among the pledges of the Republicans was to end the Korean War and to support the Taft-Hartley Act , which restricted the activities of labour unions.
As the campaign of 1952 had neared, Eisenhower let it be known that he was a Republican, and the eastern wing of that party, headed by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, the party’s unsuccessful nominee in 1948, made an intensive effort to persuade Eisenhower to seek the Republican presidential nomination. His name was entered in several state primaries against the more conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Although the results were mixed, Eisenhower decided to run. In June 1952 the five-star general retired from the army after 37 years of service, returned to the United States, and began to campaign actively.
Without an incumbent candidate in the White House , there was intense interest in who would win the nomination of each of the two major parties. There was also speculation as to whether a serious third-party candidacy, like Strom Thumond ’s Dixiecrat bid in 1948 , would materialize, particularly for Douglas MacArthur , the general who led United Nations forces in Korea until he was relieved of his duties in 1951 for insubordination by Pres. Harry S. Truman .
General election campaign
Attempts to organize would-be supporters of MacArthur failed to secure any recognition from him. Although workers on his behalf had formal organization in seven states (Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, North Dakota, Washington, California, and Tennessee) under various designations (including America First, Christian Nationalist, and Constitution) and although it was expected that votes would be “written in” in 13 states, the outcome proved that such MacArthur support had no effect upon the final election result in any state.
The election was conducted against the backdrop of a “Red Scare” in which many Americans feared that foreign communist agents were attempting to infiltrate the government. Two years earlier Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, who held that the Roosevelt and Truman administrations amounted to “20 years of treason,” claimed that he had a list of State Department employees who were loyal only to the Soviet Union. Though McCarthy offered no evidence to support his charges and revealed only a single name, he won a large personal following. The Red Scare, the stalemated Korean War, and a renewal of inflation gravely handicapped Stevenson, who fought a vigorous campaign.
Eisenhower, despite his age (61), campaigned tirelessly, impressing millions with his warmth and sincerity. His wide, friendly grin, wartime heroics, and middle-class pastimes—he was an avid golfer and bridge player and a fan not of highbrow literature but of the American western—endeared him to the public and garnered him vast support. Mamie Eisenhower, like her husband, projected a down-to-earth image.
One of the most dramatic incidents of the campaign was associated with Nixon. The New York Post reported that Nixon had a secret “slush fund.” Eisenhower was willing to give Nixon a chance to clear himself but emphasized that Nixon needed to emerge from the crisis “as clean as a hound’s tooth.” On September 23, 1952, Nixon took to television and delivered what has been dubbed the “Checkers” speech, in which he acknowledged the existence of the fund but denied that any of it had been used improperly. The speech is perhaps best remembered for its maudlin conclusion, in which Nixon admitted accepting one political gift—a cocker spaniel that his six-year-old daughter, Tricia, had named Checkers. “Regardless of what they say about it,” he declared, “we are going to keep it.” Although Nixon initially thought that the speech had been a failure, the public responded favourably, and a reassured Eisenhower told him, “You’re my boy.”
On the eve of the election there was a general opinion that the presidential race was close. The final tally, however, was anything but. Eisenhower won by more than six million votes, capturing 39 states and 442 electoral votes to Stevenson’s 9 states and 89 electoral votes. Eisenhower even won Florida, Texas, and Virginia—three reliably Democratic states. The election was considered a great personal triumph for Eisenhower and a repudiation of the Truman administration.

The president passed a physical examination on May 12, but in June he was suddenly stricken with ileitis . After a nearly two-hour operation on June 9, full details were given—an unusually complete reporting—in the press. Convalescence was normal, but the fact of two such dangerous illnesses in nine months and the vigorous Democratic attacks on Nixon guaranteed that the health of the president would be a campaign issue.
In the winter of 1955–56 there was some speculation that Eisenhower would not seek a second term. Republican leaders urged him to run, but he was attacked as a “part-time” president by opponents—a charge resulting from his coronary thrombosis of Sept. 24, 1955, and subsequent period of rest. All speculation ended on February 29 when he announced an affirmative decision. As a “recovered heart patient,” he said, doctors felt that he could “continue to carry the burdens of the presidency,” although a regime of ordered work activity would have to be mixed with regular amounts of exercise, recreation, and rest. Interest in the future of Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon thereupon became intense. Nixon was a controversial figure, but he had proved particularly effective at campaigning in 1952 and 1954; he had also been energetic in office, visiting many countries, making policy speeches, and participating fully in cabinet and National Security Council meetings. On April 26 he informed Eisenhower that he would welcome running again as the president’s running mate, to which Eisenhower replied that he was “delighted to hear of the Vice President’s decision.”
Democratic nomination
On the Democratic side, Stevenson and Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee were engaged in a struggle in the state primaries. Victory by the latter in Minnesota made it look bad for the 1952 standard bearer. Both candidates aggressively wooed party leaders and voters and both offered alternative solutions to national problems, but increasingly bitter personal references marred their campaigning. Stevenson accused his opponent of a policy of “destroy if you can’t win” and of “wanting to win too much.” Stevenson then won three major state primaries and thus carried some momentum heading into the Democratic National Convention.

At the convention, held August 13–17 in Chicago, former president Harry S. Truman—proclaiming himself no elder statesman, since “a statesman is just a dead politician, and I’m a very lively politician”—announced himself for Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New York. Stevenson could not carry more than nine states in the general election, Truman said. Nevertheless, Stevenson handily won the nomination. In a dramatic announcement the victor told the delegates that the “free processes” of the convention should decide on his running mate. The first ballot pitted Kefauver against Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Sen. Albert A. Gore of Tennessee, Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, and Mayor John F. Wagner of New York City. Kefauver finished on top in the first ballot but without enough delegates to win outright. In the second ballot, Kennedy finished first but also without the requisite number of delegates. Following Gore’s withdrawal in favour of Kefauver, Kefauver was able to secure the vice presidential nomination.
The Democratic platform contained a compromise plank on civil rights. The national government, it promised, would be returned “to its rightful owners, the people of the United States.” In general, it declared, the administration had “confused timidity with courage and blindness with enlightenment.” Paucity of ideas, impaired unity of the free world, and “resentment rising against U.S. leadership everywhere” were the platform’s attempted indictment against the incumbent leadership. Yet the Democratic Party was not fundamentally opposed to many major U.S. policies. It favoured participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, opposed admission of the People’s Republic of China into the United Nations, and was concerned over the plight of countries dominated by the Soviet Union even though it was not in favour of liberation by force. The platform agreed with earlier Stevenson-Kefauver pleas for supplying or selling arms to Israel. It also called for the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act (anti-union legislation that had been passed in 1947 over Truman’s veto) and for enactment of new Social Security legislation.""" ;
